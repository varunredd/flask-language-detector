formerly
professor
of
physics
and

now
a
landed
proprietor
at
fontainebleau
and
member
of
the
municipal
council
of
that
charming
little

carried
to
the

letter
to
monsieur

civil

to
be
kept
at
the
postoffice
till
called
for
my
dear
child
the
good
news
you
sent
us
from
st
petersburg
caused
us
the
greatest
joy
your
poor
mother
had
been
ailing
since
winter
but
i
had
not
spoken
to
you
about
it
from
fear
of
making
you
uneasy
while
so
far
from
home
as
for
myself
i
had
not
been
very
well
and
there
was
yet
a
third
person
guess
the
name
if
you
can
who
was
languishing
from
not
seeing
you
but
content
yourself
my
dear
leon
we
have
been
recuperating
more
and
more
since
the
time
of
your
return
is
almost
fixed
we
begin
to
believe
that
the
mines
of
the
ural
will
not
swallow
up
that
which
is
dearer
to
us
than
all
the
world
thank
god
that
fortune
which
you
have
so
honorably
and
so
quickly
made
will
not
have
cost
your
life
nor
even
your
health
since
you
tell
us
you
have
been
growing
fat
off
there
in
the
desert
if
you
have
not
finished
up
all
your
business
out
there
so
much
the
worse
for
you
there
are
three
of
us
who
have
sworn
that
you
shall
never
go
back
again
you
will
not
find
it
hard
to
accede
for
you
will
be
happy
among
us
such
at
least
is
the
opinion
of
clementine
i
forget
that
i
was
pledged
not
to
name
her
master
bonnivet
our
excellent
neighbor
has
not
rested
content
with
investing
your
funds
in
a
good
mortgage
but
has
also
drawn
up
in
his
leisure
moments
a
most
edifying
little
indenture
which
now
lacks
nothing
but
your
signature
our
worthy
mayor
has
ordered
on
your
account
a
new
official
scarf
which
is
on
the
way
from
paris
you
will
have
the
first
benefit
of
it
your
apartment
which
will
soon
belong
to
a
plural
you
is
elegant
in
proportion
to
your
present
fortune
you
are
to
occupy
but
the
house
has
changed
so
in
three
years
that
my
description
would
be
incomprehensible
to
you
m
audret
the
architect
of
the
imperial
chateau
directed
the
work
he
actually
wanted
to
construct
me
a
laboratory
worthy
of
thénard
or
duprez
i
earnestly
protested
against
it
and
said
that
i
was
not
yet
worthy
of
one
as
my
celebrated
work
on
the
condensation
of
gases
had
only
reached
the
fourth
chapter
but
as
your
mother
was
in
collusion
with
the
old
scamp
of
a
friend
it
has
turned
out
that
science
has
henceforth
a
temple
in
our
housea
regular
sorcerers
den
according
to
the
picturesque
expression
of
your
old
gothon
it
lacks
nothing
not
even
a
fourhorsepower
steam
engine
alas
what
can
i
do
with
it
i
am
confident
nevertheless
that
the
expenditure
will
not
be
altogether
lost
to
the
world
you
are
not
going
to
sleep
upon
your
laurels
oh
if
i
had
only
had
your
fortune
when
i
had
your
youth
i
would
have
dedicated
my
days
to
pure
science
instead
of
losing
the
best
part
of
them
among
those
poor
young
men
who
got
nothing
from
my
lectures
but
an
opportunity
to
read
paul
de
kock
i
would
have
been
ambitiousi
would
have
striven
to
connect
my
name
with
the
discovery
of
some
great
general
law
or
at
least
with
the
invention
of
some
very
useful
apparatus
it
is
too
late
now
my
eyes
are
worn
out
and
the
brain
itself
refuses
to
work
take
your
turn
my
boy
you
are
not
yet
twentysix
the
ural
mines
have
given
you
the
wherewithal
to
live
at
ease
and
for
yourself
alone
you
have
no
further
wants
to
satisfy
the
time
has
come
to
work
for
humanity
that
you
will
do
so
is
the
strongest
wish
and
dearest
hope
of
your
doting
old
father
who
loves
you
and
who
waits
for
you
with
open
arms
j
renault
p
s
according
to
my
calculations
this
letter
ought
to
reach
berlin
two
or
three
days
before
you
you
have
been
already
informed
by
the
papers
of
the
th
inst
of
the
death
of
the
illustrious
humboldt
it
is
a
cause
of
mourning
to
science
and
to
humanity
i
have
had
the
honor
of
writing
to
that
great
man
several
times
in
my
life
and
he
once
deigned
to
reply
in
a
letter
which
i
piously
cherish
if
you
happen
to
have
an
opportunity
to
buy
some
personal
souvenir
of
him
a
bit
of
his
handwriting
or
some
fragment
of
his
collections
you
will
bring
me
a
real
pleasure
a
month
after
the
departure
of
this
letter
the
son
so
eagerly
looked
for
returned
to
the
paternal
mansion
m
and
mme
renault
who
went
to
meet
him
at
the
depot
found
him
taller
stouter
and
betterlooking
in
every
way
in
fact
he
was
no
longer
merely
a
remarkable
boy
but
a
man
of
good
and
pleasing
proportions
leon
renault
was
of
medium
height
light
hair
and
complexion
plump
and
well
made
his
large
blue
eyes
sweet
voice
and
silken
beard
indicated
a
nature
sensitive
rather
than
powerful
a
very
white
round
and
almost
feminine
neck
contrasted
singularly
with
a
face
bronzed
by
exposure
his
teeth
were
beautiful
very
delicate
a
little
inclined
backward
and
very
evenly
shaped
when
he
pulled
off
his
gloves
he
displayed
two
small
and
rather
pudgey
hands
quite
firm
and
yet
pleasantly
soft
neither
hot
nor
cold
nor
dry
nor
damp
but
agreeable
to
the
touch
and
caredfor
to
perfection
as
he
was
his
father
and
mother
would
not
have
exchanged
him
for
the
apollo
belvedere
they
embraced
him
rapturously
overwhelming
him
with
a
thousand
questions
most
of
which
he
of
course
failed
to
answer
some
old
friends
of
the
family
a
doctor
an
architect
and
a
notary
had
run
to
the
depot
with
the
good
old
people
each
one
of
them
in
turn
gave
him
a
hug
and
asked
him
if
he
was
well
and
if
he
had
had
a
pleasant
journey
he
listened
patiently
and
even
joyfully
to
this
commonplace
music
whose
words
did
not
signify
much
but
whose
melody
went
to
the
heart
because
it
came
from
the
heart
they
had
been
there
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
the
train
had
gone
puffing
on
its
way
the
omnibuses
of
the
various
hotels
had
started
one
after
another
at
a
good
trot
up
the
street
leading
to
the
city
and
the
june
sun
seemed
to
enjoy
lighting
up
this
happy
group
of
excellent
people
but
madame
renault
cried
out
all
at
once
that
the
poor
child
must
be
dying
of
hunger
and
that
it
was
barbarous
to
keep
him
waiting
for
his
dinner
any
longer
there
was
no
use
in
his
protesting
that
he
had
breakfasted
at
paris
and
that
the
voice
of
hunger
appealed
to
him
less
strongly
than
that
of
joy
they
all
got
into
two
carriages
the
son
beside
his
mother
the
father
opposite
as
if
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
his
boy
a
wagon
came
behind
with
the
trunks
long
boxes
chests
and
the
rest
of
the
travellers
baggage
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
the
hackmen
cracked
their
whips
the
baggagemen
followed
the
example
and
this
cheerful
clatter
drew
the
people
to
their
doors
and
woke
up
for
an
instant
the
quietude
of
the
streets
madame
renault
threw
her
glances
right
and
left
searching
out
the
spectators
of
her
triumph
and
saluting
with
most
cordial
affability
people
she
hardly
knew
at
all
and
more
than
one
mother
saluted
her
too
without
knowing
her
for
there
is
no
mother
indifferent
to
such
kinds
of
happiness
and
moreover
leons
family
was
liked
by
everybody
and
the
neighbors
meeting
each
other
said
with
a
satisfaction
free
from
jealousy
that
is
renaults
son
who
has
been
at
work
three
years
in
the
russian
mines
and
now
has
come
to
share
his
fortune
with
his
old
parents
leon
also
noticed
several
familiar
faces
but
not
all
that
he
wished
to
see
for
he
bent
over
an
instant
to
his
mothers
ear
saying
and
clementine
this
word
was
pronounced
so
low
and
so
close
that
m
renault
himself
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
a
word
or
a
kiss
the
good
lady
smiled
tenderly
and
answered
but
a
single
word
patience
as
if
patience
were
a
virtue
very
common
among
lovers
the
door
of
the
house
was
wide
open
and
old
gothon
was
standing
on
the
threshold
she
raised
her
arms
toward
heaven
and
cried
like
a
booby
for
she
had
known
leon
since
he
was
not
much
higher
than
her
washtub
there
was
now
another
formidable
hugging
on
the
upper
step
between
the
good
old
servant
and
her
young
master
after
a
reasonable
interval
the
friends
of
m
renault
prepared
to
leave
but
it
was
wasted
pains
for
they
were
assured
that
their
places
at
table
had
already
been
prepared
and
when
all
save
the
invisible
clementine
were
reassembled
in
the
parlor
the
great
roundbacked
chairs
held
out
their
arms
to
the
scion
of
the
house
of
renault
the
old
mirror
on
the
mantle
delighted
to
reflect
his
image
the
great
chandelier
chimed
a
little
song
of
welcome
with
its
crystal
pendants
and
the
mandarins
on
the
etagére
shook
their
heads
in
sign
of
welcome
as
if
they
were
orthodox
penates
instead
of
strangers
and
pagans
no
one
can
tell
why
kisses
and
tears
began
to
rain
down
again
but
it
certainly
did
seem
as
if
he
had
once
more
just
returned
soup
cried
gothon
madame
renault
took
the
arm
of
her
son
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
etiquette
and
without
even
apologizing
to
the
honored
guests
present
she
scarcely
excused
herself
even
for
helping
the
son
before
the
company
leon
let
her
have
her
own
way
and
took
it
all
smilingly
there
was
not
a
guest
there
who
was
not
ready
to
upset
his
soup
over
his
waistcoat
rather
than
taste
it
before
leon
mother
cried
leon
spoon
in
hand
this
is
the
first
time
for
three
years
that
ive
tasted
good
soup
madame
renault
felt
herself
blush
with
satisfaction
and
gothon
was
so
overcome
that
she
dropped
a
plate
both
fancied
that
possibly
he
had
spoken
to
please
their
selfconceit
but
nevertheless
he
spoke
truly
there
are
two
things
in
this
world
which
a
man
does
not
often
find
away
from
home
the
first
is
good
soup
the
second
is
disinterested
love
if
i
should
attempt
here
an
accurate
enumeration
of
all
the
dishes
that
appeared
on
the
table
there
would
not
be
one
of
my
readers
whose
mouth
would
not
water
i
believe
indeed
that
more
than
one
delicate
lady
would
be
in
danger
of
an
attack
of
indigestion
suppose
if
you
please
that
such
a
list
would
reach
nearly
to
the
end
of
the
volume
leaving
me
but
a
single
page
on
which
to
write
the
marvellous
history
of
fougas
therefore
i
forthwith
return
to
the
parlor
where
coffee
is
already
served
leon
took
scarcely
half
of
his
cup
but
do
not
let
that
lead
you
to
infer
that
the
coffee
was
too
hot
or
too
cold
or
too
sweet
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
prevented
his
drinking
it
to
the
last
drop
if
a
knock
at
the
streetdoor
had
not
stopped
it
just
opposite
his
heart
the
minute
which
followed
appeared
to
him
interminable
never
in
his
travels
had
he
encountered
such
a
long
minute
but
at
length
clementine
appeared
preceded
by
the
worthy
mlle
virginie
sambucco
her
aunt
and
the
mandarins
who
smiled
on
the
etagére
heard
the
sound
of
three
kisses
wherefore
three
the
superficial
reader
who
pretends
to
foresee
things
before
they
are
written
has
already
found
a
very
probable
explanation
of
course
says
he
leon
was
too
respectful
to
embrace
the
dignified
mlle
sambucco
more
than
once
but
when
he
came
to
clementine
who
was
soon
to
become
his
wife
he
very
properly
doubled
the
dose
now
sir
that
is
what
i
call
a
premature
judgment
the
first
kiss
fell
from
the
mouth
of
leon
upon
the
cheek
of
mlle
sambucco
the
second
was
applied
by
the
lips
of
mlle
sambucco
to
the
right
cheek
of
leon
the
third
was
in
fact
an
accident
that
plunged
two
young
hearts
into
profound
consternation
leon
who
was
very
much
in
love
with
his
betrothed
rushed
to
her
blindly
uncertain
whether
he
would
kiss
her
right
cheek
or
her
left
but
determined
not
to
put
off
too
long
a
pleasure
which
he
had
been
promising
himself
ever
since
the
spring
of
clementine
did
not
dream
of
defending
herself
but
was
fully
prepared
to
apply
her
pretty
rosy
lips
to
leons
right
cheek
or
his
left
indifferently
the
precipitation
of
the
two
young
people
brought
it
about
that
neither
clementines
cheeks
nor
leons
received
the
offering
intended
for
them
and
the
mandarins
on
the
etagére
who
fully
expected
to
hear
two
kisses
heard
but
one
and
leon
was
confounded
and
clementine
blushed
up
to
her
ears
and
the
two
lovers
retreated
a
step
intently
regarding
the
roses
of
the
carpet
which
will
remain
eternally
graven
upon
their
memories
in
the
eyes
of
leon
renault
clementine
was
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
he
had
loved
her
for
little
more
than
three
years
and
it
was
somewhat
on
her
account
that
he
had
taken
the
journey
to
russia
in
she
was
too
young
to
marry
and
too
rich
for
an
engineer
with
a
salary
of
francs
to
properly
make
pretentions
to
her
hand
leon
who
was
a
good
mathematician
proposed
to
himself
the
following
problem
givenone
young
girl
fifteen
and
a
half
years
old
with
an
income
of
francs
and
threatened
with
the
inheritance
from
mlle
sambucco
of
say
moreto
obtain
a
fortune
at
least
equal
to
hers
within
such
a
period
as
will
give
her
time
enough
to
grow
up
without
leaving
her
time
enough
to
become
an
old
maid
he
had
found
the
solution
in
the
ural
mines
during
three
long
years
he
had
indirectly
corresponded
with
the
beloved
of
his
heart
all
the
letters
which
he
wrote
to
his
father
or
mother
passed
into
the
hands
of
mlle
sambucco
who
did
not
keep
them
from
clementine
sometimes
indeed
they
were
read
aloud
in
the
family
and
m
renault
was
never
obliged
to
omit
a
phrase
for
leon
never
wrote
anything
which
a
young
girl
should
not
hear
the
aunt
and
the
niece
had
no
other
distractions
they
lived
retired
in
a
little
house
at
the
end
of
a
pretty
garden
and
received
no
one
but
old
friends
clementine
therefore
deserved
but
little
credit
for
keeping
her
heart
for
leon
with
the
exception
of
a
big
colonel
of
cuirassiers
who
sometimes
followed
her
in
her
walks
no
man
had
ever
made
any
demonstrations
toward
her
she
was
very
pretty
withal
and
not
so
merely
to
the
eyes
of
her
lover
or
of
the
renault
family
or
of
the
little
city
where
she
lived
provincial
towns
are
apt
to
be
easily
satisfied
they
give
the
reputation
of
being
a
pretty
woman
or
a
great
man
cheaply
especially
when
they
are
not
rich
enough
in
such
commodities
to
show
themselves
over

however
people
claim
to
admire
nothing
but
absolute
merit
i
have
heard
the
mayor
of
a
village
say
with
a
certain
pride
admit
now
that
my
servant
catherine
is
right
pretty
for
a
village
of
six
hundred
people
clementine
was
pretty
enough
to
be
admired

eight
hundred
thousand
fancy
to
yourself
a
little
blonde
creole
with
black
eyes
creamy
complexion
and
dazzling
teeth
her
figure
was
round
and
supple
as
a
twig
and
was
finished
off
with
dainty
hands
and
pretty
andalusian
feet
arched
and
beautifully
rounded
all
her
glances
were
smiles
and
all
her
movements
caresses
add
to
this
that
she
was
neither
a
fool
nor
a
prude
nor
even
an
ignoramus
like
girls
brought
up
in
convents
her
education
which
was
begun
by
her
mother
had
been
completed
by
two
or
three
respectable
old
professors
selected
by
m
renault
who
was
her
guardian
she
had
a
sound
heart
and
a
quick
mind
but
i
may
reasonably
ask
myself
why
i
have
so
much
to
say
about
her
for
she
is
still
living
and
thank
god
not
one
of
her
perfections
has
departed

obeyed

not

already
the

the

suddenly
struck
with

idea
exclaimed
you
surely
wont
go
without
helping

to

the

on
the

floor
where
furnaces

philosophical
instruments
boxes

formed
a

opened

clementine
was
seated
opposite
him
on
a
great
oblong
box
and
watched
him
with
all
her
eyes
more
from
affection
than
curiosity
they
began
by
setting
to
one
side
two
enormous
square
boxes
which
contained
nothing
but
mineralogical
specimens
after
this
they
passed
in
review
the
riches
of
all
kinds
which
the

had
crowded
among
his
linen
and
clothing
a
pleasant
odor
of

leather

permeated

is
the
custom
of
all
rich
travellers
who
on
leaving
home
left
a

amid

all
the

received
the

intended
for

there
was
a
concert
of
polite

friendly

and
thankyous
in
all
sorts
of
voices
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
much
the
greater
share
fell
to
the
lot
of
clementine
but
she
did
not
wait
to
be
urged
to
accept
them
for

the
luckiest
of
accidents

shop
at

two
magnificent
specimens
of

and
a

that
had
belonged
to

you
see
said
he
to
m
renault
on
handing
him
this
historic
staff
that
the
postscript
of
your
last
letter
did
not
fall
overboard
the
old
professor
received
the
present
with
visible
emotion
i
will
never
use
it
said
he
to
his
son
the
napoleon
of
science
has
held
it
in
his
hand
what
would
one
think
if
an
old
sergeant
like
me
should
permit
himself
to
carry
it
in
his
walks
in
the
woods
and
the
collections
were
you
not
able
to
buy
anything
from
them
did
they
sell
very
high
they
were
not
sold
answered
leon
all
were
placed
in
the
national
museum
at
berlin
but
in
my
eagerness
to
satisfy
you
i
made
a
thief
of
myself
in
a
strange
way
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
i
told
your
wish
to
a
guide
who
was
showing
me
the
place
he
told
me
that
a
friend
of
his
a
little
jew
broker
by
the
name
of
ritter
wanted
to
sell
a
very
fine
anatomical
specimen
that
had
belonged
to
the
estate
i
ran
to
the
jews
examined
the
mummy
for
such
it
was
and
without
any
haggling
paid
the
price
he
asked
but
the
next
day
a
friend
of
humboldt
professor
hirtz
told
me
the
history
of
this
shred
of
a
man
which
had
been
lying
around
the
shop
for
more
than
ten
years
and
never
belonged
to
humboldt
at
all
where
the
deuce
has
gothon
stowed
it
ah
mlle
clementine
is
sitting
on
it
clementine
attempted
to
rise
but
leon
made
her
keep
seated
we
have
plenty
of
time
said
he
to
take
a
look
at
the
old
baggage
meanwhile
you
can
well
imagine
that
it
is
not
a
very
cheerful
sight
this
is
the
history
that
good
old
hirtz
told
me
he
promised
to
send
me
in
addition
a
copy
of
a
very
curious
memoir
on
the
same
subject
dont
go
yet
my
dear
mademoiselle
sambucco
i
have
a
little
military
and
scientific
romance
for
you
we
will
look
at
the
mummy
as
soon
as
i
have
acquainted
you
with
his
misfortunes
aha
cried
m
audret
the
architect
of
the
chateau
its
the
romance
of
the
mummy
is
it
that
youre
going
to
tell
us
too
late
my
poor
leon
theophile
gautier
has
gotten
ahead
of
you
in
the
supplement
to
the
moniteur
and
all
the
world
knows
your
egyptian
history
my
history
said
leon
is
no
more
egyptian
than
manon
lescault
our
excellent
doctor
martout
here
ought
to
know
the
name
of
professor
john
meiser
of
dantzic
he
lived
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
and
i
think
that
his
last
work
appeared
in
or
in
replied
m
martout
meiser
is
one
of
the
scientific
men
who
have
done
germany
most
honor
in
the
midst
of
terrible
wars
which
drenched
his
country
in
blood
he
followed
up
the
researches
of
leeuwenkoeck
baker
needham
fontana
and
spallanzani
on
the
revivification
of
animals
our
profession
honors
in
him
one
of
the
fathers
of
modern
biology
heavens
what
ugly
big
words
cried
mlle
sambucco
is
it
decent
to
keep
people
till
this
time
of
night
to
make
them
listen
to
dutch
dont
listen
to
the
big
words
dear
little
auntey
save
yourself
for
the
romance
since
there
is
one
a
terrible
one
said
leon
mlle
clementine
is
seated
over
a
human
victim
sacrificed
to
science
by
professor
meiser
clementine
instantly
got
up
her
fiancé
handed
her
a
chair
and
seated
himself
in
the
place
she
had
just
left
the
listeners
fearing
that
leons
romance
might
be
in
several
volumes
took
their
places
around

chapter
iii
the
crime
of
the
learned
professor
meiser
ladies
said
leon
professor
meiser
was
no
vulgar
malefactor
but
a
man
devoted
to
science
and
humanity
if
he
killed
the
french
colonel
who
at
this
moment
reposes
beneath
my
coat
tails
it
was
for
the
sake
of
saving
his
life
as
well
as
of
throwing
light
on
a
question
of
the
deepest
interest
even
to
each
one
of
you
the
duration
of
our
existence
is
very
much
too
brief
that
is
a
fact
which
no
man
can
contradict
we
know
that
in
a
hundred
years
not
one
of
the
nine
or
ten
persons
assembled
in
this
house
will
be
living
on
the
face
of
the
earth
is
not
this
a
deplorable
fact
mlle
sambucco
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
and
leon
continued
alas
mademoiselle
like
you
i
have
sighed
many
a
time
at
the
contemplation
of
this
dire
necessity
you
have
a
niece
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
adorable
of
all
nieces
and
the
sight
of
her
charming
face
gladdens
your
heart
but
you
yearn
for
something
more
you
will
not
be
satisfied
until
you
have
seen
your
little
grand
nephews
trotting
around
you
will
see
them
i
earnestly
believe
but
will
you
see
their
children
it
is
doubtful
their
grandchildren
impossible
in
regard
to
the
tenth
twentieth
thirtieth
generation
it
is
useless
even
to
dream
one
will
dream
of
it
nevertheless
and
perhaps
there
is
no
man
who
has
not
said
to
himself
at
least
once
in
his
life
if
i
could
but
come
to
life
again
in
a
couple
of
centuries
one
would
wish
to
return
to
earth
to
seek
news
of
his
family
another
of
his
dynasty
a
philosopher
is
anxious
to
know
if
the
ideas
that
he
has
planted
will
have
borne
fruit
a
politician
if
his
party
will
have
obtained
the
upper
hand
a
miser
if
his
heirs
will
not
have
dissipated
the
fortune
he
has
made
a
mere
landholder
if
the
trees
in
his
garden
will
have
grown
tall
no
one
is
indifferent
to
the
future
destinies
of
this
world
which
we
gallop
through
in
a
few
years
never
to
return
to
it
again
who
has
not
envied
the
lot
of
epimenides
who
went
to
sleep
in
a
cave
and
on
reopening
his
eyes
perceived
that
the
world
had
grown
old
who
has
not
dreamed
on
his
own
account
of
the
marvellous
adventure
of
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
well
ladies
professor
meiser
one
of
the
least
visionary
men
of
the
age
was
persuaded
that
science
could
put
a
living
being
to
sleep
and
wake
him
up
again
at
the
end
of
an
infinite
number
of
yearsarrest
all
the
functions
of
the
system
suspend
life
itself
protect
an
individual
against
the
action
of
time
for
a
century
or
two
and
afterwards
resuscitate
him
he
was
a
fool
then
cried
madame
renault
i
wouldnt
swear
it
but
he
had
his
own
ideas
touching
the
mainspring
which
moves
a
living
organism
do
you
remember
good
mother
mine
the
impression
you
experienced
as
a
little
girl
when
some
one
first
showed
you
the
inside
of
a
watch
in
motion
you
were
satisfied
that
there
was
a
restless
little
animal
inside
the
case
who
worked
twentyfour
hours
a
day
at
turning
the
hands
if
the
hands
stopped
going
you
said
it
is
because
the
little
animal
is
dead
yet
possibly
he
was
only
asleep
it
has
since
been
explained
to
you
that
a
watch
contains
an
assemblage
of
parts
well
fitted
to
each
other
and
kept
well
oiled
which
being
wound
can
be
considered
to
move
spontaneously
in
a
perfect
correspondence
if
a
spring
become
broken
if
a
bit
of
the
wheel
work
be
injured
or
if
a
grain
of
sand
insinuate
itself
between
two
of
the
parts
the
watch
stops
and
the
children
say
rightly
the
little
animal
is
dead
but
suppose
a
sound
watch
well
made
right
in
every
particular
and
stopped
because
the
machinery
would
not
run
from
lack
of
oil
the
little
animal
is
not
dead
nothing
but
a
little
oil
is
needed
to
wake
him
up
here
is
a
firstrate
chronometer
made
in
london
it
runs
fifteen
days
without
being
wound
i
gave
it
a
turn
of
the
key
yesterday
it
has
then
thirteen
days
to
run
if
i
throw
it
on
the
ground
or
if
i
break
the
mainspring
all
is
over
i
will
have
killed
the
little
animal
but
suppose
that
without
damaging
anything
i
find
means
to
withdraw
or
dry
up
the
fine
oil
which
now
enables
the
parts
to
slip
upon
one
another
will
the
little
animal
be
dead
no
it
will
be
asleep
and
the
proof
is
that
i
can
lay
my
watch
in
a
drawer
keep
it
there
twentyfive
years
and
if
after
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
put
a
drop
of
oil
on
it
the
parts
will
begin
to
move
again
all
that
time
would
have
passed
without
waking
up
the
little
sleeping
animal
it
will
still
have
thirteen
days
to
go
after
the
time
when
it
starts
again
all
living
beings
according
to
the
opinion
of
professor
meiser
are
watches
or
organisms
which
move
breathe
nourish
themselves
and
reproduce
themselves
as
long
as
their
organs
are
intact
and
properly
oiled
the
oil
of
the
watch
is
represented
in
the
animal
by
an
enormous
quantity
of
water
in
man
for
example
water
provides
about
fourfifths
of
the
whole
weight
givena
colonel
weighing
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
there
are
thirty
pounds
of
colonel
and
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
or
about
sixty
quarts
of
water
this
is
a
fact
proven
by
numerous
experiments
i
say
a
colonel
just
as
i
would
say
a
king
all
men
are
equal
when
submitted
to
analysis
professor
meiser
was
satisfied
as
are
all
physiologists
that
to
break
a
colonels
head
or
to
make
a
hole
in
his
heart
or
to
cut
his
spinal
column
in
two
is
to
kill
the
little
animal
because
the
brain
the
heart
the
spinal
marrow
are
the
indispensable
springs
without
which
the
machine
cannot
go
but
he
thought
too
that
in
removing
sixty
quarts
of
water
from
a
living
person
one
merely
puts
the
little
animal
to
sleep
without
killing
himthat
a
colonel
carefully
dried
up
can
remain
preserved
a
hundred
years
and
then
return
to
life
whenever
any
one
will
replace
in
him
the
drop
of
oil
or
rather
the
sixty
quarts
of
water
without
which
the
human
machine
cannot
begin
moving
again
this
opinion
which
may
appear
inadmissible
to
you
and
to
me
too
but
which
is
not
absolutely
rejected
by
our
friend
doctor
martout
rests
upon
a
series
of
reliable
observations
which
the
merest
tyro
can
verify
today
there
are
animals
which
can
be
resuscitated
nothing
is
more
certain
or
better
proven
herr
meiser
like
the
abbé
spallanzani
and
many
others
collected
from
the
gutter
of
his
roof
some
little
dried
worms
which
were
brittle
as
glass
and
restored
life
to
them
by
soaking
them
in
water
the
capacity
of
thus
returning
to
life
is
not
the
privilege
of
a
single
species
its
existence
has
been
satisfactorily
established

and

at

of
the

one

up
a

good
night
to
him
somebody
soaks
him
a
little
and
he
wakes
up
to
bid
you
good
day
all
depends
upon
taking
great
care
while
he
is
dry
you
understand
that
if
any
one
should
merely
break
his
head
no
drop
of
water
nor
river
nor
ocean
could
restore
him
the
marvellous
thing
is
that
an
animal
which
cannot
live
more
than
a
year
like
the
minute
worm
in
grainsmut
can
lie
by
twentyfour
years
without
dying

has
taken
the
precaution
of
desiccating

needham
collected
a
lot
of
them
in
he
presented
them
to
martin
folkes
who
gave
them
to
baker
and
these
interesting
creatures
revived
in
water
in
they
enjoyed
a
rare
satisfaction
in
elbowing
their
own
twentyeighth
generation
wouldnt
a
man
who
should
see
his
own
twentyeighth
generation
be
a
happy
grandfather
another
no
less
interesting
fact
is
that
desiccated
animals
have
vastly
more
tenacity
of
life
than
others
if
the
temperature
were
suddenly
to
fall
thirty
degrees
in
this
laboratory
we
should
all
get
inflammation
of
the
lungs
if
it
were
to
rise
as
much
there
would
be
danger
of
congestion
of
the
brain
well
a
desiccated
animal
which
is
not
absolutely
dead
and
which
will
revive
tomorrow
if
i
soak
it
faces
with
impunity
variations
of
ninetyfive
degrees
and
sixtenths
m
meiser
and
plenty
of
others
have
proved
it
it
remains
to
inquire
then
if
a
superior
animal
a
man
for
instance
can
be
desiccated
without
any
more
disastrous
consequences
than
a
little
worm
or
a
tardigrade
m
meiser
was
convinced
that
it
is
practicable
he
wrote
to
that
effect
in
all
his
books
although
he
did
not
demonstrate
it
by
experiment
now
where
would
be
the
harm
in
it
ladies
all
men
curious
in
regard
to
the
future
or
dissatisfied
with
life
or
out
of
sorts
with
their
contemporaries
could
hold
themselves
in
reserve
for
a
better
age
and
we
should
have
no
more
suicides
on
account
of
misanthropy
valetudinarians
whom
the
ignorant
science
of
the
nineteenth
century
declares
incurable
neednt
blow
their

out
any
more
they
can
have
themselves
dried
up
and
wait
peaceably
in
a

until

shall
have
found
a
remedy
for
their

rejected

need
no
longer
throw

they
can
put
themselves
under

make
their

thirty
years
later
young
handsome
and
triumphant
satirizing
the
age
of

and
paying

they

no

complete
their

they

they
will
merely
dry
them
up

for

according
to
the
gravity
of
their
deserts
a

no

of

you
have
ladies
a
feeble
delineation
of
the
benefits
which
doctor
meiser
hoped
to
pour
upon
europe
by
introducing
the
desiccation
of
man
he
made
his
great
experiment
in
on
a
french
colonela
prisoner
i
have
been
told
and
condemned
as
a
spy
by
courtmartial
unhappily
he
did
not
succeed
for
i
bought
the
colonel
and
his
box
for
the
price
of
an
ordinary
cavalry
horse
in
the
dirtiest
shop
in
berlin
chapter
iv
the
victim
my
dear
leon
said
m
renault
you
remind
me
of
a
college
commencement
we
have
listened
to
your
dissertation
just
as
they
listen
to
the
latin
discourse
of
the
professor
of
rhetoric
there
are
always
in
the
audience
a
majority
which
learns
nothing
from
it
and
a
minority
which
understands
nothing
of
it
but
every
body
listens
patiently
on
account
of
the
sensations
which
are
to
come
by
and
by
m
martout
and
i
are
acquainted
with
meisers
works
and
those
of
his
distinguished
pupil
m
pouchet
you
have
then
said
too
much
that
is
in
them
if
you
intended
to
speak
for
our
benefit
and
you
have
not
said
enough
that
is
in
them
for
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
know
nothing
of
the
existing
discussions
regarding
the
vital
and
organic
principles
is
life
a
principle
of
action
which
animates
the
organs
and
puts
them
into
play
is
it
not
on
the
contrary
merely
the
result
of
organizationthe
play
of
various
functions
of
organized
matter
this
is
a
problem
of
the
highest
importance
which
would
interest
the
ladies
themselves
if
one
were
to
place
it
plainly
before
them
it
would
be
sufficient
to
say
we
inquire
whether
there
is
a
vital
principlethe
source
of
all
functions
of
the
body
or
if
life
be
not
merely
the
result
of
the
regular
play
of
the
organs
the
vital
principle
in
the
eyes
of
meiser
and
his
disciple
does
not
exist
if
it
really
existed
they
say
one
could
not
understand
how
it
can
leave
a
man
and
a
tardigrade
when
they
are
desiccated
and
return
to
them
again
when
they
are
soaked
now
if
there
be
no
vital
principle
all
the
metaphysical
and
moral
theories
which
have
been
hypothecated
on
its
existence
must
be
reconstructed
these
ladies
have
listened
to
you
patiently
it
is
but
justice
to
them
to
admit
but
all
that
they
have
been
able
to
gather
from
your
slightly
latinish
discourse
is
that
you
have
given
them
a
dissertation
instead
of
the
romance
you
promised
but
we
all
forgive
you
for
the
sake
of
the
mummy
you
are
going
to
show
us
open
the
colonels
box
weve
well
earned
the
sight
cried
clementine
laughing
but
suppose
you
were
to
get
frightened
id
have
you
know
sir
that
im
not
afraid
of
anybody
not
even
of
live
colonels
leon
took
his
bunch
of
keys
and
opened
the
long
oak
box
on
which
he
had
been
seated
the
lid
being
raised
they
saw
a
great
leaden
casket
which
enclosed
a
magnificent
walnut
box
carefully
polished
on
the
outside
and
lined
on
the
inside
with
white
silk
and
padded
the
others
brought
their
lamps
and
candles
near
and
the
colonel
of
the
d
of
the
line
appeared
as
if
he
were
in
a
chapel
illuminated
for
his
lying
in
state
one
would
have
said
that
the
man
was
asleep
the
perfect
preservation
of
the
body
attested
the
paternal
care
of
the
murderer
it
was
truly
a
remarkable
preparation
and
would
have
borne
comparison
with
the
finest
european
mummies
described
by
vicq
dazyr
in
and
by
the
younger
puymaurin
in
the
part
best
preserved
as
is
always
the
case
was
the
face
all
the
features
had
maintained
a
proud
and
manly
expression
if
any
old
friend
of
the
colonel
had
been
present
at
the
opening
of
the
third
box
he
would
have
recognized
him
at
first
sight
undoubtedly
the
point
of
the
nose
was
a
little
sharper
the
nostrils
less
expanded
and
thinner
and
the
bridge
a
little
more
marked
than
in
the
year
the
eyelids
were
thinned
the
lips
pinched
the
corners
of
the
mouth
drawn
down
the
cheek
bones
too
prominent
and
the
neck
visibly
shrunken
which
exaggerated
the
prominence
of
the
chin
and
larynx
but
the
eyelids
were
closed
without
contraction
and
the
sockets
much
less
hollow
than
one
could
have
expected
the
mouth
was
not
at
all
distorted
like
the
mouth
of
a
corpse
the
skin
was
slightly
wrinkled
but
had
not
changed
color
it
had
only
become
a
little
more
transparent
showing
after
a
fashion
the
color
of
the
tendons
the
fat
and
the
muscles
wherever
it
rested
directly
upon
them
it
also
had
a
rosy
tint
which
is
not
ordinarily
seen
in
embalmed
corpses
doctor
martout
explained
this
anomaly
by
saying
that
if
the
colonel
had
actually
been
dried
alive
the
globules
of
the
blood
were
not
decomposed
but
simply
collected
in
the
capillary
vessels
of
the
skin
and
subjacent
tissues
where
they
still
preserved
their
proper
color
and
could
be
seen
more
easily
than
otherwise
on
account
of
the
semitransparency
of
the
skin
the
uniform
had
become
much
too
large
as
may
be
readily
understood
though
it
did
not
seem
at
a
casual
glance
that
the
members
had
become
deformed
the
hands
were
dry
and
angular
but
the
nails
although
a
little
bent
inward
toward
the
root
had
preserved
all
their
freshness
the
only
very
noticeable
change
was
the
excessive
depression
of
the
abdominal
walls
which
seemed
crowded
downward
toward
the
posterior
side
at
the
right
a
slight
elevation
indicated
the
place
of
the
liver
a
tap
of
the
finger
on
the
various
parts
of
the
body
produced
a
sound
like
that
from
dry
leather
while
leon
was
pointing
out
these
details
to
his
audience
and
doing
the
honors
of
his
mummy
he
awkwardly
broke
off
the
lower
part
of
the
right
ear
and
a
little
piece
of
the
colonel
remained
in
his
hand
this
trifling
accident
might
have
passed
unnoticed
had
not
clementine
who
followed
with
visible
emotion
all
the
movements
of
her
lover
dropped
her
candle
and
uttered
a
cry
of
affright
all
gathered
around
her
leon
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
a
chair
m
renault
ran
after
salts
she
was
as
pale
as
death
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
fainting
she
soon
recovered
however
and
reassured
them
all
by
a
charming
smile
pardon
me
she
said
for
such
a
ridiculous
exhibition
of
terror
but
what
monsieur
leon
was
saying
to
us
and
then
that
figure
which
seemed
sleeping
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
poor
man
was
going
to
open
his
mouth
and
cry
out
when
he
was
injured
leon
hastened
to
close
the
walnut
box
while
m
martout
picked
up
the
piece
of
ear
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
but
clementine
while
continuing
to
smile
and
make
apologies
was
overcome
by
a
fresh
accession
of
emotion
and
melted
into
tears
the
engineer
threw
himself
at
her
feet
poured
forth
excuses
and
tender
phrases
and
did
all
he
could
to
console
her
inexplicable
grief
clementine
dried
her
eyes
looked
prettier
than
ever
and
sighed
fit
to
break
her
heart
without
knowing
why
beast
that
i
am
muttered
leon
tearing
his
hair
on
the
day
when
i
see
her
again
after
three
years
absence
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
soulinspiring
than
showing
her
mummies
he
launched
a
kick
at
the
triple
coffin
of
the
colonel
saying
i
wish
the
devil
had
the
confounded
colonel
no
cried
clementine
with
redoubled
energy
and
emotion
do
not
curse
him
monsieur
leon
he
has
suffered
so
much
ah
poor
poor
unfortunate
man
mlle
sambucco
felt
a
little
ashamed
she
made
excuses
for
her
niece
and
declared
that
never
since
her
tenderest
childhood
had
she
manifested
such
extreme
sensitiveness
m
and
mme
renault
who
had
seen
her
grow
up
doctor
martout
who
had
held
the
sinecure
of
physician
to
her
the
architect
the
notary
in
a
word
everybody
present
was
plunged
into
a
state
of
absolute
stupefaction
clementine
was
no
sensitive
plant
she
was
not
even
a
romantic
school
girl
her
youth
had
not
been
nourished
by
anne
radcliffe
she
did
not
trouble
herself
about
ghosts
and
she
would
go
through
the
house
very
tranquilly
at
ten
oclock
at
night
without
a
candle
when
her
mother
died
some
months
before
leons
departure
she
did
not
wish
to
have
any
one
share
with
her
the
sad
satisfaction
of
watching
and
praying
in
the
deathchamber
this
will
teach
us
said
the
aunt
how
to
stay
up
after
ten
oclock
what
it
is
midnight
all
to
quarter
of
an
hour
come
my
child
you
will
get
better
fast
enough
after
you
get
to
bed
clementine
arose
submissively
but
at
the
moment
of
leaving
the
laboratory
she
retraced
her
steps
and
with
a
caprice
more
inexplicable
than
her
grief
she
absolutely
wished
to
see
the
mummy
of
the
colonel
again
her
aunt
scolded
in
vain
in
spite
of
the
remarks
of
mlle
sambucco
and
all
the
persons
present
she
reopened
the
walnut
box
kneeled
down
beside
the
mummy
and
kissed
it
on
the
forehead
poor
man
said
she
rising
how
cold
he
is
monsieur
leon
promise
me
that
if
he
is
dead
you
will
have
him
laid
in
consecrated
ground
as
you
please
mademoiselle
i
had
intended
to
send
him
to
the
anthropological
museum
with
my
fathers
permission
but
you
know
that
we
can
refuse
you
nothing
they
did
not
separate
as
gaily
by
a
good
deal
as
they
had
met
m
renault
and
his
son
escorted
mlle
sambucco
and
her
niece
to
their
door
and
met
the
big
colonel
of
cuirassiers
who
had
been
honoring
clementine
with
his
attentions
the
young
girl
tenderly
pressed
the
arm
of
her
betrothed
and
said
here
is
a
man
who
never
sees
me
without
sighing
and
what
sighs
gracious
heavens
it
wouldnt
take
more
than
two
to
fill
the
sails
of
a
a
ship
the
race
of
colonels
has
vastly
degenerated
since
one
doesnt
see
any
more
such
fine
looking
ones
as
our
unfortunate
friend
leon
agreed
with
all
she
said
but
he
did
not
exactly
see
how
he
had
become
the
friend
of
a
mummy
for
which
he
had
just
paid
twentyfive
louis
to
divert
the
conversation
he
said
to
clementine
i
have
not
yet
shown
you
all
the
nice
things
i
brought
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
all
the
russias
made
me
a
present
of
a
little
enamelled
gold
star
hanging
at
the
end
of
a
ribbon
do
you
like
buttonhole
ribbons
oh
yes
answered
she
the
red
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
did
you
notice
the
poor
colonel
still
has
a
shred
of
one
on
his
uniform
but
the
cross
is
there
no
longer
those
wicked
germans
tore
it
away
from
him
when
they
took
him
prisoner
its
very
possible
said
leon
when
they
reached
mlle
sambuccos
house
it
was
time
to
separate
clementine
offered
her
hand
to
leon
who
would
have
been
better
pleased
with
her
cheek
father
and
son
returned
home
arm
in
arm
with
slow
steps
giving
themselves
up
to
endless
conjectures
regarding
the
whimsical
emotions
of
clementine
mme
renault
was
waiting
to
put
her
son
to
bed
a
timehonored
and
touching
habit
which
mothers
do
not
early
lose
she
showed
him
the
handsome
apartment
above
the
parlor
and
m
renaults
laboratory
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
future
domicile
you
will
be
as
snug
in
here
as
a
little
cock
in
a
pie
said
she
showing
him
a
bedchamber
fairly
marvellous
in
its
comfort
all
the
furniture
is
soft
and
rounded
without
a
single
angle
a
blind
man
could
walk
here
without
any
fear
of
hurting
himself
see
how
i
understand
domestic
comfort
why
each
armchair
can
be
a
friend
this
will
cost
you
a
trifle
penon
brothers
came
from
paris
expressly
but
a
man
ought
to
be
comfortable
at
home
so
that
he
may
have
no
temptation
to
go
abroad
this
sweet
motherly
prattle
stretched
itself
over
two
good
hours
and
much
of
it
related
to
clementine
as
you
will
readily
suppose
leon
had
found
her
prettier
than
he
had
dreamed
her
in
his
sweetest
visions
but
less
loving
devil
take
me
said
he
blowing
out
his
candle
one
might
think
that
that
confounded
stuffed
colonel
had
come
to
thrust
himself
between
us
chapter
v
dreams
of
love
and
other
dreams
leon
learned
to
his
cost
that
a
good
conscience
and
a
good
bed
are
not
enough
to
insure
a
good
sleep
he
was
bedded
like
a
sybarite
innocent
as
an
arcadian
shepherd
and
moreover
tired
as
a
soldier
after
a
forced
march
nevertheless
a
dull
sleeplessness
weighed
upon
him
until
morning
in
vain
he
tossed
into
every
possible
position
as
if
to
shift
the
burden
from
one
shoulder
on
to
the
other
he
did
not
close
his
eyes
until
he
had
seen
the
first
glimmering
of
dawn
silver
the
chinks
of
his
shutters
he
lulled
himself
to
sleep
thinking
of
clementine
an
obliging
dream
soon
showed
him
the
image
of
her
he
loved
he
saw
her
in
bridal
costume
in
the
chapel
of
the
imperial
chateau
she
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
elder
m
renault
who
had
put
spurs
on
in
honor
of
the
ceremony
leon
followed
having
given
his
arm
to
mlle
sambucco
the
ancient
maiden
was
decorated
with
the
insignia
of
the
legion
of
honor
on
approaching
the
altar
the
bridegroom
noticed
that
his
fathers
legs
were
as
thin
as
broomsticks
and
when
he
was
about
expressing
his
astonishment
m
renault
turned
around
and
said
to
him
they
are
thin
because
they
are
desiccated
but
they
are
not
deformed
while
he
was
giving
this
explanation
his
face
altered
his
features
changed
he
shot
out
a
black
moustache
and
grew
terribly
like
the
colonel
the
ceremony
began
the
choir
was
filled
with
tardigrades
and
rotifers
as
large
as
men
and
dressed
like
choristers
they
intoned
in
solemn
measure
a
hymn
of
the
german
composer
meiser
which
began
thus
the
vital
principle
is
a
gratuitous
hypothesis
the
poetry
and
the
music
appeared
admirable
to
leon
he
was
trying
to
impress
them
on
his
memory
when
the
officiating
priest
advanced
toward
him
with
two
gold
rings
on
a
silver
salver
this
priest
was
a
colonel
of
cuirassiers
in
full
uniform
leon
asked
himself
when
and
where
he
had
met
him
it
was
on
the
previous
evening
before
clementines
door
the
cuirassier
murmured
these
words
the
race
of
colonels
has
vastly
degenerated
since
he
heaved
a
profound
sigh
and
the
nave
of
the
chapel
which
was
a
shipoftheline
was
driven
over
the
water
at
a
speed
of
forty
knots
leon
tranquilly
took
the
little
gold
ring
and
prepared
to
place
it
on
clementines
finger
but
he
perceived
that
the
hand
of
his
betrothed
was
dried
up
the
nails
alone
had
retained
their
natural
freshness
he
was
frightened
and
fled
across
the
church
which
he
found
filled
with
colonels
of
every
age
and
variety
the
crowd
was
so
dense
that
the
most
unheardof
efforts
failed
to
penetrate
it
he
escapes
at
last
but
hears
behind
him
the
hurried
steps
of
a
man
who
tries
to
catch
him
he
doubles
his
speed
he
throws
himself
on
allfours
he
gallops
he
neighs
the
trees
on
the
way
seem
to
fly
behind
him
he
no
longer
touches
the
earth
but
the
enemy
comes
up
faster
than
the
wind
leon
hears
the
sound
of
his
steps
his
spurs
jingle
he
catches
up
with
leon
seizes
him
by
the
mane
flings
himself
with
a
bound
upon
his
back
and
goads
him
with
the
spur
leon
rears
the
rider
bends
over
toward
his
ear
and
says
stroking
him
with
his
whip
i
am
not
heavy
to
carrythirty
pounds
of
colonel
the
unhappy
lover
of
mlle
clementine
makes
a
violent
effort
and
springs
sideways
the
colonel
falls
and
draws
his
sword
leon
loses
no
time
he
puts
himself
on
guard
and
fights
but
almost
instantly
feels
the
colonels
sword
enter
his
heart
to
the
hilt
the
chill
of
the
blade
spreads
further
and
further
and
ends
by
freezing
leon
from
head
to
foot
the
colonel
draws
nearer
and
says
smiling
the
mainspring
is
broken
the
little
animal
is
dead
he
puts
the
body
in
the
walnut
box
which
is
too
short
and
too
narrow
cramped
on
every
side
leon
struggles
strains
and
wakes
himself
up
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
half
smothered
between
the
bed
and
the
wall
he
quickly
jumped
into
his
slippers
and
eagerly
raised
the
windows
and
pushed
open
the
shutters
he
made
light
and
saw
that
it
was
good
as
is
elsewhere
written
brrroum
he
shook
off
the
recollections
of
his
dream
as
a
wet
dog
shakes
off
drops
of
water
the
famous
london
chronometer
told
him
that
it
was
nine
oclock
a
cup
of
chocolate
served
by
gothon
helped
not
a
little
to
untangle
his
ideas
on
proceeding
with
his
toilet
in
a
very
bright
cheerful
and
convenient
dressingroom
he
reconciled
himself
to
the
realities
of
life
everything
considered
he
said
to
himself
combing
out
his
yellow
beard
nothing
but
happiness
has
come
to
me
here
i
am
in
my
native
country
with
my
family
and
in
a
pretty
house
which
is
our
own
my
father
and
mother
are
both
well
and
for
myself
i
revel
in
the
most
luxuriant
health
our
fortune
is
moderate
but
so
are
our
tastes
and
we
shall
never
feel
the
want
of
anything
our
friends
received
me
yesterday
with
open
arms
and
as
for
enemies
we
have
none
the
prettiest
girl
in
fontainebleau
is
willing
to
become
my
wife
i
can
marry
her
in
less
than
three
weeks
if
i
see
fit
to
hurry
things
a
little
clementine
did
not
meet
me
as
if
i
were
of
no
interest
to
her
far
from
it
her
lovely
eyes
smiled
upon
me
last
night
with
the
most
tender
regard
it
is
true
that
she
wept
at
the
end
thats
too
certain
that
is
my
only
vexation
my
only
anxiety
the
sole
cause
of
that
foolish
dream
i
had
last
night
she
did
weep
but
why
because
i
was
beast
enough
to
regale
her
with
a
lecture
and
that
too
about
a
mummy
all
right
ill
have
the
mummy
buried
ill
hold
back
my
dissertations
and
nothing
else
in
the
world
will
come
to
disturb
our
happiness
he
went
down
stairs
humming
an
air
from
the
nozze
m
and
mme
renault
who
were
not
accustomed
to
going
to
bed
after
midnight
were
still
asleep
on
going
into
the
laboratory
he
saw
that
the
triple
box
of
the
colonel
was
closed
gothon
had
placed
a
little
wooden
cross
and
a
sprig
of
consecrated
box
on
the
cover
we
may
as
well
begin
masses
for
his
soul
he
murmured
between
his
teeth
with
a
smile
that
might
have
been
a
little
sceptical
at
the
same
time
he
noticed
that
clementine
in
her
agitation
had
forgotten
the
presents
he
had
brought
her
he
made
a
bundle
of
them
looked
at
his
watch
and
concluded
that
there
would
be
no
indiscretion
in
straining
a
point
to
go
to
mlle
sambuccos
the
muchtoberespected
aunt
was
an
early
riser
as
they
generally
are
in
the
rural
districts
and
had
in
fact
already
gone
out
to
church
and
clementine
was
gardening
near
the
house
she
ran
to
her
lover
without
thinking
of
throwing
down
the
little
rake
she
held
in
her
hand
and
with
the
sweetest
smile
in
the
world
held
up
her
pretty
rosy
cheeks
which
were
a
little
moist
and
flushed
by
the
pleasant
warmth
of
pleasure
and
exercise
arent
you
put
out
with
me
said
she
i
was
very
ridiculous
last
night
my
aunt
has
scolded
me
in
the
bargain
and
i
forgot
to
take
the
pretty
things
you
brought
me
from
among
the
savages
but
it
was
not
from
lack
of
appreciation
i
am
so
happy
to
see
that
you
have
always
thought
of
me
as
i
have
thought
of
you
i
could
have
sent
for
them
today
but
i
am
pleasantly
anticipated
my
heart
told
me
that
you
would
come
yourself
your
heart
knew
me
dear
clementine
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
if
it
did
not
know
its
owner
how
good
you
are
and
how
much
i
love
you
oh
i
too
dear
leon
i
love
you
dearly
she
stood
the
rake
against
a
tree
and
hung
upon
the
arm
of
her
intended
husband
with
that
supple
and
languishing
grace
the
secret
of
which
the
creoles
possess
come
this
way
said
she
so
that
i
can
show
you
all
the
improvements
we
have
made
in
the
garden
leon
admired
everything
she
wanted
him
to
the
fact
is
that
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
her
the
grotto
of
polyphemus
and
the
cave
of
cæcus
would
have
appeared
to
him
pleasanter
than
the
gardens
of
armida
if
clementines
little
red
jacket
had
been
promenading
in
them
he
asked
her
if
she
did
not
feel
some
regret
in
leaving
so
charming
a
retreat
and
one
which
she
had
embellished
with
so
much
care
why
asked
she
without
thinking
to
blush
we
will
not
go
far
off
and
besides
wont
we
come
here
every
day
the
coming
marriage
was
a
thing
so
well
settled
that
it
had
not
even
been
spoken
of
on
the
previous
evening
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
publish
the
bans
and
fix
the
date
clementine
simple
and
honest
heart
expressed
herself
without
any
false
modesty
concerning
an
event
so
entirely
expected
so
natural
and
so
agreeable
she
had
expressed
her
tastes
to
mme
renault
in
the
arrangement
of
the
new
apartments
and
chosen
the
hangings
herself
and
she
no
longer
made
any
ceremony
in
talking
with
her
intended
of
the
happy
life
in
common
which
was
about
beginning
for
them
of
the
people
they
would
invite
to
the
marriage
ceremony
of
the
wedding
calls
to
be
made
afterwards
of
the
day
which
should
be
appropriated
for
receptions
and
of
the
time
they
would
devote
to
each
others
society
and
to
work
she
inquired
in
regard
to
the
occupation
which
leon
intended
to
make
for
himself
and
the
hours
which
of
preference
he
would
give
to
study
this
excellent
little
woman
would
have
been
ashamed
to
bear
the
name
of
a
sloth
and
unhappy
in
passing
her
days
with
an
idler
she
promised
leon
in
advance
to
respect
his
work
as
a
sacred
thing
on
her
part
she
thoroughly
intended
to
make
her
time
also
of
use
and
not
to
live
with
folded
arms
at
the
start
she
would
take
charge
of
the
housekeeping
under
the
direction
of
madame
renault
who
was
beginning
to
find
it
a
little
burdensome
and
then
would
she
not
soon
have
children
to
care
for
bring
up
and
educate
this
was
a
noble
and
useful
pleasure
which
she
did
not
intend
to
share
with
any
one
nevertheless
she
would
send
her
sons
to
college
in
order
to
fit
them
for
living
in
the
world
and
to
teach
them
early
those
principles
of
justice
and
equality
which
are
the
foundation
of
every
good
manly
character
leon
let
her
talk
on
only
interrupting
her
to
agree
with
her
for
these
two
young
people
who
had
been
educated
and
brought
up
with
the
same
ideas
saw
everything
with
the
same
eyes
education
had
created
this
pleasant
harmony
rather
than
love
do
you
know
said
clementine
that
i
felt
an
awful
palpitation
of
the
heart
when
i
entered
the
room
where
you
were
yesterday
if
you
think
that
my
heart
beat
less
violently
than
yours
oh
but
it
was
a
different
thing
with
me
i
was
afraid
what
of
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
not
find
you
the
same
as
i
had
seen
you
in
my
thoughts
remember
that
it
had
been
three
years
since
we
bid
each
other
good
bye
i
remembered
distinctly
what
you
were
when
you
went
away
and
with
imagination
helping
memory
a
little
i
had
reconstructed
my
leon
entire
but
if
you
had
no
longer
resembled
him
what
would
have
become
of
me
in
the
presence
of
a
new
leon
when
i
had
formed
the
pleasant
habit
of
loving
the
other
you
make
me
tremble
but
your
first
greeting
reassured
me
in
advance
tut
sir
dont
speak
of
that
first
greeting
or
you
will
make
me
blush
a
second
time
let
us
speak
rather
of
that
poor
colonel
who
made
me
shed
so
many
tears
how
is
he
getting
along
this
morning
i
forgot
to
inquire
after
his
health
but
if
you
want
me
to
its
useless
you
can
announce
to
him
a
visit
from
me
today
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
him
this
noon
you
would
be
very
sensible
to
give
up
this
fancy
why
expose
yourself
again
to
such
painful
emotions
the
fancy
is
stronger
than
i
am
seriously
dear
leon
the
old
fellow
attracts
me
why
old
fellow
he
has
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
died
when
from
twentyfive
to
thirty
years
of
age
are
you
very
sure
that
he
is
dead
i
said
old
fellow
because
of
a
dream
i
had
last
night
ha
you
too
yes
you
remember
how
agitated
i
was
on
leaving
you
and
moreover
i
had
been
scolded
by
my
aunt
and
too
i
had
been
thinking
of
terrible
sightsmy
poor
mother
lying
on
her
deathbed
in
fact
my
spirits
were
quite
broken
down
poor
dear
little
heart
nevertheless
as
i
did
not
want
to
think
about
anything
any
more
i
went
to
bed
quickly
and
shut
my
eyes
with
all
my
might
so
tightly
indeed
that
i
put
myself
to
sleep
it
was
not
long
before
i
saw
the
colonel
he
was
lying
as
i
saw
him
in
his
triple
coffin
but
he
had
long
white
hair
and
a
most
benign
and
venerable
appearance
he
begged
us
to
put
him
in
consecrated
ground
and
we
carried
him
you
and
i
to
the
fontainebleau
cemetery
on
reaching
my
mothers
tomb
we
saw
that
the
stone
was
displaced
my
mother
in
a
white
robe
was
moved
so
as
to
make
a
place
beside
her
and
she
seemed
waiting
for
the
colonel
but
every
time
we
attempted
to
lay
him
down
the
coffin
left
our
hands
and
rested
suspended
in
the
air
as
if
it
had
no
weight
i
could
distinguish
the
poor
old
mans
features
for
his
triple
coffin
had
become
as
transparent
as
the
alabaster
lamp
burning
near
the
ceiling
of
my
chamber
he
was
sad
and
his
broken
ear
bled
freely
all
at
once
he
escaped
from
our
hands
the
coffin
vanished
and
i
saw
nothing
but
him
pale
as
a
statue
and
tall
as
the
tallest
oaks
of
the
basbreau
his
golden
epaulettes
spread
out
and
became
wings
and
he
raised
himself
to
heaven
holding
over
us
both
hands
as
if
in
blessing
i
woke
up
all
in
tears
but
i
have
not
told
my
dream
to
my
aunt
for
she
would
have
scolded
me
again
no
one
ought
to
be
scolded
but
me
clementine
dear
it
is
my
fault
that
your
gentle
slumbers
are
troubled
by
visions
of
the
other
world
but
all
this
will
be
stopped
soon
today
i
am
going
to
seek
a
definite
receptacle
for
the
colonel

a
young
girls
caprice
clementine
had
a
fresh
young
heart
before
knowing
leon
she
had
loved
but
one
personher
mother
no
cousins
of
either
sex
nor
uncles
nor
aunts
nor
grandfathers
nor
grandmothers
had
dissipated
by
dividing
it
among
themselves
that
little
treasure
of
affection
which
wellconstituted
children
bring
into
the
world
the
grandmother
clementine
pichon
was
married
at
nancy
in
january
and
died
three
months
later
in
the
suburbs
of
toulon
during
her
first
confinement
the
grandfather

subcommissary
of
the
first
class
being
left
a
widower
with
a
daughter
in
the
cradle
devoted
himself
to
bringing
up
his
child
he
gave
her
in
to
m
sambucco
an
estimable
and
agreeable
man
of
italian
extraction
born
in
france
and
kings
counsel
in
the
court
of
marseilles
in
m
sambucco
who
was
a
man
of
considerable
independence
because
he
had
resources
of
his
own
in
some
manner
highly
honorable
to
himself
incurred
the
illwill
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
he
was
therefore
appointed
advocategeneral
to
martinique
and
after
some
days
of
hesitation
accepted
the
transfer
to
that
remote
situation
but
old
m
langevin
did
not
easily
console
himself
for
the
departure
of
his
daughter
he
died
two
years
later
without
having
embraced
the
little
clementine

whom
it
was

the
time
how
he
had
fallen
a
victim
to
his
devotion
to
others
after
this
fearful
misfortune
the
young
widow
hastened
to
recross
the
sea
with
her
daughter
she
settled
in
fontainebleau
in
order
that
the
child
might
live
in
a
healthy
atmosphere
fontainebleau
is
one
of
the
healthiest
places
in
france
if
mme
sambucco
had
been
as
good
a
manager
as
she
was
mother
she
would
have
left
clementine
a
respectable
fortune
but
she
regulated
her
affairs
badly
and
got
herself
under
heavy
embarrassments
a
neighboring
notary
relieved
her
of
a
round
sum
and
two
farms
which
she
had
paid
dearly
for
brought
her
almost
nothing
in
short
she
no
longer
knew
what
her
situation
was
and
began
to
lose
all
control
of
it
when
a
sister
of
her
husband
an
old
maid
pinched
and
pious
expressed
a
desire
to
live
with
her
and
use
their
resources
in
common
the
arrival
of
this
longtoothed
spinster
strangely
frightened
the
little
clementine
who
hid
herself
under
the
furniture
and
nestled
among
her
mothers
skirts
but
it
was
the
salvation
of
the
house
mlle
sambucco
was
not
one
of
the
most
spirituelle
nor
one
of
the
most
romantic
of
women
but
she
was
order
incarnated
she
reduced
the
expenses
handled
the
resources
herself
sold
the
two
farms
in
bought
some
threepercents
in
and
restored
stable
equilibrium
in
the
budget
thanks
to
the
talents
and
activity
of
this
female
steward
the
gentle
and
improvident
widow
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
fondle
her
child
clementine
learned
to
honor
the
virtues
of
her
aunt
but
she
adored
her
mother
when
she
had
the
affliction
of
losing
her
she
found
herself
alone
in
the
world
leaning
on
mlle
sambucco
like
a
young
plant
on
a
prop
of
dry
wood
it
was
then
that
her
friendship
for
leon
glimmered
with
a
vague
ray
of
love
and
young
renault
profited
by
the
necessity
for
expansion
which
filled
this
youthful
soul
during
the
three
long
years
that
leon
spent
away
from
her
clementine
scarcely
knew
that
she
was
alone
she
loved
and
felt
that
she
was
loved
in
return
she
had
faith
in
the
future
and
an
inner
life
of
tenderness
and
timid
hope
and
this
noble
and
gentle
heart
required
nothing
more
but
what
completely
astonished
her
betrothed
her
aunt
and
herself
and
strangely
subverted
all
the
best
accredited
theories
respecting
the
feminine
heartwhat
indeed
reason
would
have
refused
to
credit
had
it
not
been
established
by
facts
was
that
the
day
when
she
again
met
the
husband
of
her
choice
an
hour
after
she
had
thrown
herself
into
leons
arms
with
a
grace
so
full
of
trust
clementine
was
so
abruptly
invaded
by
a
new
sentiment
which
was
not
love
nor
friendship
nor
fear
but
transcended
them
all
and
spoke
with
master
tones
in
her
heart
from
the
instant
when
leon
had
shown
her
the
figure
of
the
colonel
she
had
been
seized
by
an
actual
passion
for
this
nameless
mummy
it
was
nothing
like
what
she
felt
towards
young
renault
but
it
was
a
combination
of
interest
compassion
and
respectful
sympathy
if
any
one
had
recounted
some
famous
feat
of
arms
or
some
romantic
history
of
which
the
colonel
had
been
the
hero
this
impression
would
have
been
natural
or
at
least
explicable
but
she
knew
nothing
of
him
except
that
he
had
been
condemned
as
a
spy
by
a
council
of
war
and
yet
she
dreamed
of
him
the
very
night
after
leons
return
this
inexplicable
prepossession
at
first
manifested
itself
in
a
religious
form
she
caused
a
mass
to
be
said
for
the
repose
of
the
colonels
soul
and
urged
leon
to
make
preparations
for
the
funeral
herself
selecting
the
ground
in
which
he
was
to
be
interred
these
various
cares
never
caused
her
to
omit
her
daily
visit
to
the
walnut
box
or
the
respectful
bending
of
the
knee
before
the
body
or
the
sisterly
or
filial
kiss
which
she
regularly
placed
upon
its
forehead
the
renault
family
soon
became
uneasy
about
such
strange
symptoms
and
hastened
the
interment
of
the
attractive
unknown
in
order
to
relieve
themselves
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
but
the
day
before
the
one
fixed
for
the
ceremony
clementine
changed
her
mind
by
what
right
could
they
shut
in
the
tomb
a
man
who
possibly
was
not
dead
the
theories
of
the
learned
doctor
meiser
were
not
such
that
one
could
reject
them
without
examination
the
matter
was
at
least
worthy
of
a
few
days
reflection
was
it
not
possible
to
submit
the
colonels
body
to
some
experiments
professor
hirtz
of
berlin
had
promised
to
send
some
valuable
documents
concerning
the
life
and
death
of
this
unfortunate
officer
nothing
ought
to
be
undertaken
before
they
were
received
some
one
ought
to
write
to
berlin
to
hasten
the
sending
of
these
papers
leon
sighed
but
yielded
uncomplainingly
to
this
new
caprice
and
wrote
to
m
hirtz
clementine
found
an
ally
in
this
second
campaign
in
doctor
martout
though
he
was
but
an
average
practitioner
and
disdained
the
acquisition
of
practice
far
too
much
m
martout
was
not
deficient
in
knowledge
he
had
long
been
studying
five
or
six
great
questions
in
physiology
such
as
reanimation
spontaneous
generation
and
the
topics
connected
with
them
a
regular
correspondence
kept
him
posted
in
all
recent
discoveries
he
was
the
friend
of
m
pouchet
of
rouen
and
knew
also
the
celebrated
karl
nibor
who
has
carried
the
use
of
the
microscope
into
researches
so
wide
and
so
profound
m
martout
had
desiccated
and
resuscitated
thousands
of
little
worms
rotifers
and
tardigrades
he
held
that
life
is
nothing
but
organization
in
action
and
that
the
idea
of
reviving
a
desiccated
man
has
nothing
absurd
about
it
he
gave
himself
up
to
long
meditations
when
professor
hirtz
sent
from
berlin
the
following
document
the
original
of
which
is
filed
among
the
manuscripts
of
the
humboldt
collection
chapter
vii
professor
meisers
will
in
favor
of
the
desiccated
colonel
on
this
th
day
of
january
being
worn
down
by
a
cruel
malady
and
feeling
the
approach
of
the
time
when
my
person
shall
be
absorbed
in
the
great
all
i
have
written
with
my
own
hand
this
testament
which
is
the
expression
of
my
last
will
i
appoint
as
executor
my
nephew
nicholas
meiser
a
wealthy
brewer
in
the
city
of
dantzic
i
bequeath
my
books
papers
and
scientific
collections
of
all
kinds
except
item
to
my
very
estimable
and
learned
friend
herr
von
humboldt
i
bequeath
all
the
rest
of
my
effects
real
and
personal
valued
at
prussian
thalers
or
francs
to
colonel
pierre
victor
fougas
at
present
desiccated
but
living
and
entered
in
my
catalogue
opposite
no
zoology
i
trust
that
he
will
accept
this
feeble
compensation
for
the
ordeals
he
has
undergone
in
my
laboratory
and
the
service
he
has
rendered
to
science
finally
in
order
that
my
nephew
nicholas
meiser
may
exactly
understand
the
duties
i
leave
him
to
perform
i
have
resolved
to
inscribe
here
a
detailed
account
of
the
desiccation
of
colonel
fougas
my
sole
heir
it
was
on
the
th
of
november
in
that
unhappy
year
that
my
relations
with
this
brave
young
man
began
i
had
long
since
quitted
dantzic
where
the
noise
of
cannon
and
the
danger
from
bombs
had
rendered
all
labor
impossible
and
retired
with
my
instruments
and
books
under
the
protection
of
the
allied
armies
in
the
fortified
town
of
liebenfeld
the
french
garrisons
of
dantzic
stettin
custrin
glogau
hamburg
and
several
other
german
towns
could
not
communicate
with
each
other
or
with
their
native
land
meanwhile
general
rapp
was
obstinately
defending
himself
against
the
english
fleet
and
the
russian
army
colonel
fougas
was
taken
by
a
detachment
of
the
barclay
de
tolly
corps
as
he
was
trying
to
pass
the
vistula
on
the
ice
on
the
way
to
dantzic
they
brought
him
prisoner
to
liebenfeld
on
the
th
of
november
just
at
my
supper
time
and
sergeant
garok
who
commanded
in
the
village
forced
me
to
be
present
at
the
examination
and
act
as
interpreter
the
open
countenance
manly
voice
proud
firmness
and
fine
carriage
of
the
unfortunate
young
man
won
my
heart
he
had
made
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
his
only
regret
he
said
was
having
stranded
so
near
port
after
passing
through
four
armies
and
being
unable
to
carry
out
the
emperors
orders
he
appeared
animated
by
that
french
fanaticism
which
has
done
so
much
harm
to
our
beloved
germany
nevertheless
i
could
not
help
defending
him
and
i
translated
his
words
less
as
an
interpreter
than
as
an
advocate
unhappily
they
found
upon
him
a
letter
from
napoleon
to
general
rapp
of
which
i
preserved
a
copy
abandon
dantzic
break
the
blockade
unite
with
the
garrisons
of
stettin
custrin
and
glogau
march
along
the
elbe
arrange
with
st
cyr
and
davoust
to
concentrate
the
forces
scattered
at
dresden
forgau
wittenberg
magdeburg
and
hamburg
roll
up
an
army
like
a
snow
ball
cross
westphalia
which
is
open
and
come
to
defend
the
line
of
the
rhine
with
an
army
of
frenchmen
which
you
will
have
saved
napoleon
this
letter
was
sent
to
the
headquarters
of
the
russian
army
whilst
a
halfdozen
illiterate
soldiers
drunk
with
joy
and
bad
brandy
condemned
the
brave
colonel
of
the
d
of
the
line
to
the
death
of
a
spy
and
a
traitor
the
execution
was
fixed
for
the
next
day
the
th
and
m
pierre
victor
fougas
after
having
thanked
and
embraced
me
with
the
most
touching
sensibility
he
is
a
husband
and
a
father
was
shut
up
in
the
little
battlemented
tower
of
liebenfeld
where
the
wind
whistles
terribly
through
all
the
loopholes
the
night
of
the
th
and
th
of
november
was
one
of
the
severest
of
that
terrible
winter
my
selfregistering
thermometer
which
hung
outside
my
window
with
a
southeast
exposure
marked
nineteen
degrees
below
zero
centigrade
i
went
early
in
the
morning
to
bid
the
colonel
a
last
farewell
and
met
sergeant
garok
who
said
to
me
in
bad
german
we
wont
have
to
kill
the
frantzouski
he
is
frozen
to
death
i
ran
to
the
prison
the
colonel
was
lying
on
his
back
rigid
but
i
found
after
a
few
minutes
examination
that
the
rigidity
of
the
body
was
not
that
of
death
the
joints
though
they
had
not
their
ordinary
suppleness
could
be
bent
and
extended
without
any
great
effort
the
limbs
the
face
and
the
chest
gave
my
hands
a
sensation
of
cold
but
very
different
from
that
which
i
had
often
experienced
from
contact
with
corpses
knowing
that
he
had
passed
several
nights
without
sleep
and
endured
extraordinary
fatigues
i
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
fallen
into
that
profound
and
lethargic
sleep
which
is
superinduced
by
intense
cold
and
which
if
too
far
prolonged
slackens
respiration
and
circulation
to
a
point
where
the
most
delicate
physiological
tests
are
necessary
to
discover
the
continuance
of
life
the
pulse
was
insensible
at
least
my
fingers
benumbed
with
cold
could
not
feel
it
my
hardness
of
hearing
i
was
then
in
my
sixtyninth
year
prevented
my
determining
by
auscultation
whether
the
beats
of
the
heart
still
aroused
those
feeble
though
prolonged
vibrations
which
the
ear
continues
to
hear
some
time
after
the
hand
fails
to
detect
them
the
colonel
had
reached
that
point
of
torpor
produced
by
cold
where
to
revive
a
man
without
causing
him
to
die
requires
numerous
and
delicate
attentions
some
hours
after
congelation
would
supervene
and
with
it
impossibility
of
restoration
to
life
i
was
in
the
greatest
perplexity
on
the
one
hand
i
knew
that
he
was
dying
on
my
hands
by
congelation
on
the
other
i
could
not
by
myself
bestow
upon
him
the
attentions
that
were
indispensable
if
i
were
to
administer
stimulants
without
having
him
at
the
same
time
rubbed
on
the
trunk
and
limbs
by
three
or
four
vigorous
assistants
i
would
revive
him
only
to
see
him
die
i
had
still
before
my
eyes
the
spectacle
of
that
lovely
young
girl
asphyxiated
in
a
fire
whom
i
succeeded
in
reviving
by
placing
burning
coals
under
the
clavicles
but
who
could
only
call
her
mother
and
died
almost
immediately
in
spite
of
the
administration
of
internal
stimulants
and
electricity
for
inducing
contractions
of
the
diaphragm
and
heart
and
even
if
i
should
succeed
in
bringing
him
back
to
health
and
strength
was
not
he
condemned
by
courtmartial
did
not
humanity
forbid
my
rousing
him
from
this
repose
akin
to
death
to
deliver
him
to
the
horrors
of
execution
i
must
confess
that
in
the
presence
of
this
organism
where
life
was
suspended
my
ideas
on
reanimation
took
as
it
were
fresh
hold
upon
me
i
had
so
often
desiccated
and
revived
beings
quite
elevated
in
the
animal
scale
that
i
did
not
doubt
the
success
of
the
operation
even
on
a
man
by
myself
alone
i
could
not
revive
and
save
the
colonel
but
i
had
in
my
laboratory
all
the
instruments
necessary
to
desiccate
him
without
assistance
to
sum
up
three
alternatives
offered
themselves
to
me
i
to
leave
the
colonel
in
the
crenellated
tower
where
he
would
have
died
the
same
day
of
congelation
ii
to
revive
him
by
stimulants
at
the
risk
of
killing
him
and
for
what
to
give
him
up
in
case
of
success
to
inevitable
execution
iii
to
desiccate
him
in
my
laboratory
with
the
quasi
certainty
of
resuscitating
him
after
the
restoration
of
peace
all
friends
of
humanity
will
doubtless
comprehend
that
i
could
not
hesitate
long
i
had
sergeant
garok
called
and
i
begged
him
to
sell
me
the
body
of
the
colonel
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
i
had
bought
a
corpse
for
dissection
so
my
request
excited
no
suspicion
the
bargain
concluded
i
gave
him
four
bottles
of
kirschwasser
and
soon
two
russian
soldiers
brought
me
colonel
fougas
on
a
stretcher
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
with
him
i
pricked
one
of
his
fingers
pressure
forced
out
a
drop
of
blood
to
place
it
under
a
microscope
between
two
plates
of
glass
was
the
work
of
a
minute
oh
joy
the
fibrin
was
not
coagulated
the
red
globules
appeared
cleanly
circular
flattened
biconcave
and
without
notches
indentations
or
spheroidal
swellings
the
white
globules
changed
their
shape
taking
at
intervals
the
spherical
form
and
varying
their
shapes
again
by
delicate
expansions
i
was
not
deceived
then
it
was
a
torpid
man
that
i
had
under
my
eyes
and
not
a
dead
one
i
placed
him
on
a
pair
of
scales
he
weighed
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
clothing
included
i
did
not
care
to
undress
him
for
i
had
noticed
that
animals
desiccated
directly
in
contact
with
the
air
died
oftener
than
those
which
remained
covered
with
moss
and
other
soft
materials
during
the
ordeal
of
desiccation
my
great
airpump
with
its
immense
platform
its
enormous
oval
wroughtiron
receiver
which
a
rope
running
on
a
pulley
firmly
fixed
in
the
ceiling
easily
raised
and
lowered
by
means
of
a
windlassall
these
thousand
and
one
contrivances
which
i
had
so
laboriously
prepared
in
spite
of
the
railleries
of
those
who
envied
me
and
which
i
felt
desolate
at
seeing
unemployed
were
going
to
find
their
use
unexpected
circumstances
had
arisen
at
last
to
procure
me
such
a
subject
for
experiment
as
i
had
in
vain
endeavored
to
procure
while
i
was
attempting
to
reduce
to
torpidity
dogs
rabbits
sheep
and
other
mammals
by
the
aid
of
freezing
mixtures
long
ago
without
doubt
would
these
results
have
been
attained
if
i
had
been
aided
by
those
who
surrounded
me
instead
of
being
made
the
butt
of
their
railleries
if
our
authorities
had
sustained
me
with
their
influence
instead
of
treating
me
as
a
subversive
spirit
i
shut
myself
up
têteàtête
with
the
colonel
and
took
care
that
even
old
getchen
my
housekeeper
now
deceased
should
not
trouble
me
during
my
work
i
had
substituted
for
the
wearisome
lever
of
the
old
fashioned
airpumps
a
wheel
arranged
with
an
eccentric
which
transformed
the
circular
movement
of
the
axis
into
the
rectilinear
movement
required
by
the
pistons
the
wheel
the
eccentric
the
connecting
rod
and
the
joints
of
the
apparatus
all
worked
admirably
and
enabled
me
to
do
everything
by
myself
the
cold
did
not
impede
the
play
of
the
machine
and
the
lubricating
oil
was
not
gummed
i
had
refined
it
myself
by
a
new
process
founded
on
the
then
recent
discoveries
of
the
french
savant
m
chevreul
having
extended
the
body
on
the
platform
of
the
airpump
lowered
the
receiver
and
luted
the
rim
i
undertook
to
submit
it
gradually
to
the
influence
of
a
dry
vacuum
and
cold
capsules
filled
with
chloride
of
calcium
were
placed
around
the
colonel
to
absorb
the
water
which
should
evaporate
from
the
body
and
to
promote
the
desiccation
i
certainly
found
myself
in
the
best
possible
situation
for
subjecting
the
human
body
to
a
process
of
gradual
desiccation
without
sudden
interruption
of
the
functions
or
disorganization
of
the
tissues
or
fluids
seldom
had
my
experiments
on
rotifers
and
tardigrades
been
surrounded
with
equal
chances
of
success
yet
they
had
always
succeeded
but
the
particular
nature
of
the
subject
and
the
special
scruples
imposed
upon
my
conscience
obliged
me
to
employ
a
certain
number
of
new
conditions
which
i
had
long
since
in
other
connections
foreseen
the
expediency
of
i
had
taken
the
pains
to
arrange
an
opening
at
each
end
of
my
oval
receiver
and
fit
into
it
a
heavy
glass
which
enabled
me
to
follow
with
my
eye
the
effects
of
the
vacuum
on
the
colonel
i
was
entirely
prevented
from
shutting
the
windows
of
my
laboratory
from
fear
that
a
too
elevated
temperature
might
put
an
end
to
the
lethargy
of
the
subject
or
induce
some
change
in
the
fluids
if
a
thaw
had
come
on
all
would
have
been
over
with
my
experiment
but
the
thermometer
kept
for
several
days
between
six
and
eight
degrees
below
zero
and
i
was
very
happy
in
seeing
the
lethargic
sleep
continue
without
having
to
fear
congelation
of
the
tissues
i
commenced
to
produce
the
vacuum
with
extreme
slowness
for
fear
that
the
gases
distributed
through
the
blood
becoming
free
on
account
of
the
difference
of
their
tension
from
that
of
rarified
air
might
escape
in
the
vessels
and
so
bring
on
immediate
death
moreover
i
watched
every
moment
the
effects
of
the
vacuum
on
the
intestinal
gases
for
by
expanding
inside
in
proportion
as
the
pressure
of
the
air
diminished
outside
of
the
body
they
could
have
caused
serious
disorders
the
tissues
might
not
have
been
entirely
ruptured
by
them
but
an
internal
lesion
would
have
been
enough
to
occasion
death
in
a
few
hours
after
reanimation
one
observes
this
quite
frequently
in
animals
carelessly
desiccated
several
times
too
rapid
a
protrusion
of
the
abdomen
put
me
on
my
guard
against
the
danger
which
i
feared
and
i
was
obliged
to
let
in
a
little
air
under
the
receiver
at
last
the
cessation
of
all
phenomena
of
this
kind
satisfied
me
that
the
gases
had
disappeared
by
exosmose
or
had
been
expelled
by
the
spontaneous
contraction
of
the
viscera
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
first
day
that
i
could
give
up
these
minute
precautions
and
carry
the
vacuum
a
little
further
the
next
day
the
th
i
pushed
the
vacuum
to
a
point
where
the
barometer
fell
to
five
millimetres
as
no
change
had
taken
place
in
the
position
of
the
body
or
limbs
i
was
sure
that
no
convulsion
had
been
produced
the
colonel
had
been
desiccated
had
become
immobile
had
lost
the
power
of
performing
the
functions
of
life
without
death
having
supervened
and
without
the
possibility
of
returning
to
activity
having
departed
his
life
was
suspended
not
extinguished
each
time
that
a
surplus
of
watery
vapor
caused
the
barometer
to
ascend
i
pumped
on
the
th
the
door
of
my
laboratory
was
literally
broken
in
by
the
russian
general
count
trollohub
who
had
been
sent
from
headquarters
this
distinguished
officer
had
run
in
all
haste
to
prevent
the
execution
of
the
colonel
and
to
conduct
him
into
the
presence
of
the
commander
in
chief
i
loyally
confessed
to
him
what
i
had
done
under
the
inspiration
of
my
conscience
i
showed
him
the
body
through
one
of
the
bullseyes
of
the
airpump
i
told
him
that
i
was
happy
to
have
preserved
a
man
who
could
furnish
useful
information
to
the
liberators
of
my
country
and
i
offered
to
resuscitate
him
at
my
own
expense
if
they
would
promise
me
to
respect
his
life
and
liberty
the
general
count
trollohub
unquestionably
a
distinguished
man
but
one
of
an
exclusively
military
education
thought
that
i
was
not
speaking
seriously
he
went
out
slamming
the
door
in
my
face
and
treating
me
like
an
old
fool
i
set
myself
to
pumping
again
and
kept
the
vacuum
at
a
pressure
of
from
three
to
five
millimetres
for
the
space
of
three
months
i
knew
by
experience
that
animals
can
revive
after
being
submitted
to
a
dry
vacuum
and
cold
for
eighty
days
on
the
th
of
february
having
observed
that
for
a
month
no
modification
had
taken
place
in
the
shrinking
of
the
flesh
i
resolved
to
submit
the
colonel
to
another
series
of
operations
in
order
to
insure
more
perfect
preservation
by
complete
desiccation
i
let
the
air
reenter
by
the
stopcock
arranged
for
the
purpose
and
after
raising
the
receiver
proceeded
at
once
to
my
experiment
the
body
did
not
weigh
more
than
fortysix
pounds
i
had
then
reduced
it
nearly
to
a
third
of
its
original
weight
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
clothing
had
not
lost
as
much
water
as
the
other
parts
now
the
human
body
contains
nearly
fourfifths
of
its
own
weight
of
water
as
is
proved
by
a
desiccation
thoroughly
made
in
a
chemical
drying
furnace
i
accordingly
placed
the
colonel
on
a
tray
and
after
sliding
it
into
my
great
furnace
gradually
raised
the
temperature
to
degrees
centigrade
i
did
not
dare
to
go
beyond
this
heat
from
fear
of
altering
the
albumen
and
rendering
it
insoluble
and
also
of
taking
away
from
the
tissues
the
capacity
of
reabsorbing
the
water
necessary
to
a
return
to
their
functions
i
had
taken
care
to
arrange
a
convenient
apparatus
so
that
the
furnace
was
constantly
traversed
by
a
current
of
dry
air
this
air
was
dried
in
traversing
a
series
of
jars
filled
with
sulphuric
acid
quicklime
and
chloride
of
calcium
after
a
week
passed
in
the
furnace
the
general
appearance
of
the
body
had
not
changed
but
its
weight
was
reduced
to
forty
pounds
clothing
included
eight
days
more
brought
no
new
decrease
of
weight
from
this
i
concluded
that
the
desiccation
was
sufficient
i
knew
very
well
that
corpses
mummified
in
church
vaults
for
a
century
or
more
end
by
weighing
no
more
than
a
halfscore
of
pounds
but
they
do
not
become
so
light
without
a
material
alteration
in
their
tissues
on
the
th
of
february
i
myself
placed
the
colonel
in
the
boxes
which
i
had
had
made
for
his
occupancy
since
that
time
that
is
to
say
during
a
space
of
nine
years
and
eleven
months
we
have
never
been
separated
i
carried
him
with
me
to
dantzic
he
stays
in
my
house
i
have
never
placed
him
according
to
his
number
in
my
zoological
collection
he
remains
by
himself
in
the
chamber
of
honor
i
do
not
grant
any
one
the
pleasure
of
reusing
his
chloride
of
calcium
i
will
take
care
of
you
till
my
dying
day
oh
colonel
fougas
dear
and
unfortunate
friend
but
i
shall
not
have
the
joy
of
witnessing
your
resurrection
i
shall
not
share
the
delightful
emotions
of
the
warrior
returning
to
life
your
lachrymal
glands
inert
today
but
some
day
to
be
reanimated
will
not
pour
upon
the
bosom
of
your
old
benefactor
the
sweet
dew
of
recognition
for
you
will
not
recover
your
life
until
a
day
when
mine
will
have
long
since
departed
perhaps
you
will
be
astonished
that
i
loving
you
as
i
do
should
have
so
long
delayed
to
draw
you
out
of
this
profound
slumber
who
knows
but
that
some
bitter
reproach
may
come
to
taint
the
tenderness
of
the
first
offices
of
gratitude
that
you
will
perform
over
my
tomb
yes
i
have
prolonged
without
any
benefit
to
you
an
experiment
of
general
interest
to
others
i
ought
to
have
remained
faithful
to
my
first
intention
and
restored
your
life
immediately
after
the
signature
of
peace
but
what
was
it
well
to
send
you
back
to
france
when
the
sun
of
your
fatherland
was
obscured
by
our
soldiers
and
allies
i
have
spared
you
that
spectacleone
so
grievous
to
such
a
soul
as
yours
without
doubt
you
would
have
had
in
march
the
consolation
of
again
seeing
that
fatal
man
to
whom
you
had
consecrated
your
devotion
but
are
you
entirely
sure
that
you
would
not
have
been
swallowed
up
with
his
fortune
in
the
shipwreck
of
waterloo
for
five
or
six
years
past
it
has
not
been
your
welfare
nor
even
the
welfare
of
science
that
prevented
me
from
reanimating
you
it
has
been
forgive
me
colonel
it
has
been
a
cowardly
attachment
to
life
the
disorder
from
which
i
am
suffering
and
which
will
soon
carry
me
off
is
an
aneurism
of
the
heart
violent
emotions
are
interdicted
to
me
if
i
were
myself
to
undertake
the
grand
operation
whose
process
i
have
traced
in
a
memorandum
annexed
to
this
instrument
i
would
without
any
doubt
succumb
before
finishing
it
my
death
would
be
an
untoward
accident
which
might
trouble
my
assistants
and
cause
your
resuscitation
to
fail
rest
content
you
will
not
have
long
to
wait
and
moreover
what
do
you
lose
by
waiting
you
do
not
grow
old
you
are
always
twentyfour
years
of
age
your
children
are
growing
up
you
will
be
almost
their
contemporary
when
you
come
to
life
again
you
came
to
liebenfeld
poor
you
are
now
in
my
house
poor
and
my
will
makes
you
rich
that
you
may
be
happy
also
is
my
dearest
wish
i
direct
that
the
day
after
my
death
my
nephew
nicholas
meiser
shall
call
together
by
letter
the
ten
physicians
most
illustrious
in
the
kingdom
of
prussia
that
he
shall
read
to
them
my
will
and
the
annexed
memorandum
and
that
he
shall
cause
them
to
proceed
without
delay
in
my
own
laboratory
to
the
resuscitation
of
colonel
fougas
the
expenses
of
travel
maintenance
etc
etc
shall
be
deducted
from
the
assets
of
my
estate
the
sum
of
two
thousand
thalers
shall
be
devoted
to
the
publication
of
the
glorious
results
of
the
experiment
in
german
french
and
latin
a
copy
of
this
pamphlet
shall
be
sent
to
each
of
the
learned
societies
then
existing
in
europe
in
the
entirely
unexpected
event
of
the
efforts
of
science
being
unable
to
reanimate
the
colonel
all
my
effects
shall
revert
to
nicholas

sole
surviving
relative

chapter
viii
how
nicholas
meiser
nephew
of
john
meiser
executed
his
uncles
will
doctor
hirtz
of
berlin
who
had
copied
this
will
himself
apologized
very
politely
for
not
having
sent
it
sooner
business
had
obliged
him
to
travel
away
from
the
capital
in
passing
through
dantzic
he
had
given
himself
the
pleasure
of
visiting
herr
nicholas
meiser
the
former
brewer
now
a
very
wealthy
landowner
and
heavy
holder
of
stocks
sixtysix
years
of
age
this
old
man
very
well
remembered
the
death
and
will
of
his
uncle
the
savant
but
he
did
not
speak
of
them
without
a
certain
reluctance
moreover
he
said
that
immediately
after
the
decease
of
john
meiser
he
had
called
together
ten
physicians
of
dantzic
around
the
mummy
of
the
colonel
he
showed
also
a
unanimous
statement
of
these
gentlemen
affirming
that
a
man
desiccated
in
a
furnace
cannot
in
any
way
or
by
any
means
return
to
life
this
certificate
drawn
up
by
the
professional
competitors
and
enemies
of
the
deceased
made
no
mention
of
the
paper
annexed
to
the
will
nicholas
meiser
swore
by
all
the
gods
but
not
without
visibly
coloring
that
this
document
concerning
the
methods
to
be
pursued
in
resuscitating
the
colonel
had
never
been
known
by
himself
or
his
wife
when
interrogated
regarding
the
reasons
which
could
have
brought
him
to
part
with
a
trust
as
precious
as
the
body
of
m
fougas
he
said
that
he
had
kept
it
in
his
house
fifteen
years
with
every
imaginable
respect
and
care
but
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
becoming
beset
with
visions
and
being
awakened
almost
every
night
by
the
colonels
ghost
coming
and
pulling
at
his
feet
he
concluded
to
sell
it
for
twenty
crowns
to
a
berlin
amateur
since
he
had
been
rid
of
this
dismal
neighbor
he
had
slept
a
great
deal
better
but
not
entirely
well
yet
for
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
to
forget
the
apparition
of
the
colonel
to
these
revelations
herr
hirtz
physician
to
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
of
prussia
added
some
remarks
of
his
own
he
did
not
think
that
the
resuscitation
of
a
healthy
man
desiccated
with
precaution
was
impossible
in
theory
he
thought
also
that
the
process
of
desiccation
indicated
by
the
illustrious
john
meiser
was
the
best
to
follow
but
in
the
present
case
it
did
not
appear
to
him
probable
that
colonel
fougas
could
be
called
back
to
life
the
atmospheric
influences
and
the
variations
of
temperature
which
he
had
undergone
during
a
period
of
forty
six
years
must
have
altered
the
fluids
and
the
tissues
this
was
also
the
opinion
of
m
renault
and
his
son
to
quiet
clementines
excitement
a
little
they
read
to
her
the
concluding
paragraphs
of
prof
hirtz
letter
they
kept
from
her
john
meisers
will
which
could
have
done
nothing
but
excite
her
but
the
little
imagination
worked
on
without
cessation
do
what
they
would
to
quiet
it
clementine
now
sought
the
company
of
doctor
martout
she
held
discussions
with
him
and
wanted
to
see
experiments
in
the
resuscitation
of
rotifers
when
she
got
home
again
she
would
think
a
little
about
leon
and
a
great
deal
about
the
colonel
the
project
of
marriage
was
still
entertained
but
no
one
ventured
to
speak
about
the
publication
of
the
bans
to
the
most
touching
endearments
of
her
betrothed
the
young
fiancée
responded
with
disquisitions
on
the
vital
principle
her
visits
to
the
renaults
house
were
paid
less
to
the
living
than
to
the
dead
all
the
arguments
they
put
in
use
to
cure
her
of
a
foolish
hope
served
only
to
throw
her
into
a
profound
melancholy
her
beautiful
complexion
grew
pale
the
brilliancy
of
her
glance
died
away
undermined
by
a
hidden
disorder
she
lost
the
amiable
vivacity
which
had
appeared
to
be
the
sparkling
of
youth
and
joy
the
change
must
have
been
very
noticeable
for
even
mlle
sambucco
who
had
not
a
mothers
eyes
was
troubled
about
it
m
martout
satisfied
that
this
malady
of
the
spirit
would
not
yield
to
any
but
a
moral
treatment
came
to
see
her
one
morning
and
said
my
dear
child
although
i
cannot
well
explain
to
myself
the
great
interest
that
you
take
in
this
mummy
i
have
done
something
for
it
and
for
you
i
am
going
to
send
the
little
piece
of
ear
that
leon
broke
off
to
m
karl
nibor
clementine
opened
all
her
eyes
dont
you
understand
me
continued
the
doctor
the
thing
is
to
find
out
whether
the
humors
and
tissues
of
the
colonel
have
undergone
material
alterations
m
nibor
with
his
microscope
will
tell
us
the
state
of
things
one
can
rely
upon
him
he
is
an
infallible
genius
his
answer
will
tell
us
if
it
be
well
to
proceed
to
the
resuscitation
of
our
man
or
whether
nothing
is
left
but
to
bury
him
what
cried
the
young
girl
one
can
tell
whether
a
man
is
dead
or
living
by
sample
nothing
more
is
required
by
doctor
nibor
forget
your
anxieties
then
for
a
week
as
soon
as
the
answer
comes
i
will
give
it
to
you
to
read
i
have
stimulated
the
curiosity
of
the
great
physiologist
he
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
the
fragment
i
send
him
but
if
to
suppose
an
impossibility
he
tells
us
that
the
piece
of
ear
belongs
to
a
sound
being
i
will
beg
him
to
come
to
fontainebleau
and
help
us
restore
his
life
this
vague
glimmer
of
hope
dissipated
clementines
melancholy
and
brought
back
her
buoyant
health
she
again
began
to
sing
and
laugh
and
flutter
about
the
garden
at
her
aunts
and
the
house
at
m
renaults
the
tender
communings
began
again
the
wedding
was
once
more
talked
over
and
the
first
ban
was
published
at
last
said
leon
i
have
found
her
again
but
madame
renault
that
wise
and
cautious
mother
shook
her
head
sadly
all
this
goes
but
half
well
said
she
i
do
not
like
to
have
my
daughterinlaw
so
absorbed
with
that
handsome
driedup
fellow
what
are
we
to
expect
when
she
knows
that
it
is
impossible
to
bring
him
to
life
again
will
the
black
butterflies
then
fly
away
and
suppose
they
happen
by
a
miracle
to
reanimate
him
are
you
sure
she
will
not
fall
in
love
with
him
indeed
leon
must
have
thought
it
very
necessary
to
buy
this
mummy
and
i
call
it
money
well
invested
one
sunday
morning
m
martout
rushed
in
upon
the
old
professor
shouting
victory
here
is
the
answer
which
had
come
to
him
from
paris
my
dear
confrère
i
have
received
your
letter
and
the
little
fragment
of
tissue
whose
nature
you
asked
me
to
determine
it
did
not
cost
me
much
trouble
to
find
out
the
matter
in
question
i
have
done
more
difficult
things
twenty
times
in
the
course
of
experiments
relating
to
medical
jurisprudence
you
could
have
saved
yourself
the
use
of
the
established
formula
when
you
shall
have
made
your
microscopic
examination
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
these
little
tricks
amount
to
nothing
my
microscope
knows
better
than
you
do
what
you
have
sent
me
you
know
the
form
and
color
of
things
it
sees
their
inmost
nature
the
laws
of
their
being
the
conditions
of
their
life
and
death
your
fragment
of
desiccated
matter
half
as
broad
as
my
nail
and
nearly
as
thick
after
remaining
for
twentyfour
hours
under
a
bellglass
in
an
atmosphere
saturated
with
water
at
the
temperature
of
the
human
body
became
suppleso
much
so
as
to
be
a
little
elastic
i
could
consequently
dissect
it
study
it
like
a
piece
of
fresh
flesh
and
put
under
the
microscope
each
one
of
its
parts
that
appeared
different
in
consistency
or
color
from
the
rest
i
at
once
found
in
the
middle
a
slight
portion
harder
and
more
elastic
than
the
rest
which
presented
the
texture
and
cellular
structure
of
cartilage
this
was
neither
the
cartilage
of
the
nose
nor
the
cartilage
of
an
articulation
but
certainly
the
fibrocartilage
of
the
ear
you
sent
me
then
the
end
of
an
ear
and
it
is
not
the
lower
endthe
lobe
which
women
pierce
to
put
their
gold
ornaments
in
but
the
upper
end
into
which
the
cartilage
extends
on
the
innerside
i
took
off
a
fine
skin
in
which
the
microscope
showed
me
an
epidermis
delicate
perfectly
intact
a
derma
no
less
intact
with
little
papillæ
and
moreover
covered
with
a
lot
of
fine
human
hairs
each
of
these
little
hairs
had
its
root
imbedded
in
its
follicle
and
the
follicle
accompanied
by
its
two
little
glands
i
will
tell
you
even
more
these
hairs
of
down
were
from
four
to
five
millimetres
long
by
from
three
to
five
hundredths
of
a
millimetre
in
diameter
this
is
twice
the
size
of
the
pretty
down
which
grows
on
a
feminine
ear
from
which
i
conclude
that
your
piece
of
ear
belongs
to
a
man
against
the
curved
edge
of
the
cartilage
i
found
delicate
striated
bunches
of
the
muscle
of
the
helix
and
so
perfectly
intact
that
one
would
have
said
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
their
contracting
under
the
skin
and
near
the
muscles
i
found
several
little
nervous
filaments
each
one
composed
of
eight
or
ten
tubes
in
which
the
medulla
was
as
intact
and
homogeneous
as
in
nerves
removed
from
a
living
animal
or
taken
from
an
amputated
limb
are
you
satisfied
do
you
cry
mercy
well
as
for
me
i
am
not
yet
at
the
end
of
my
string
in
the
cellular
tissue
interposed
between
the
cartilage
and
the
skin
i
found
little
arteries
and
little
veins
whose
structure
was
perfectly
cognizable
they
contained
some
serum
with
red
blood
globules
these
globules
were
all
of
them
circular
biconcave
and
perfectly
regular
they
showed
neither
indentations
nor
that
raspberrylike
appearance
which
characterizes
the
blood
globules
of
a
corpse
to
sum
up
my
dear
confrère
i
have
found
in
this
fragment
nearly
everything
that
is
found
in
the
human
bodycartilage
muscle
nerve
skin
hairs
glands
blood
etc
and
all
this
in
a
perfectly
healthy
and
normal
state
it
is
not
then
a
piece
of
a
corpse
which
you
sent
me
but
a
piece
of
a
living
man
whose
humors
and
tissues
are
in
no
way
decomposed
with
high
consideration
yours
karl
nibor
paris
july
th
chapter
ix
considerable
of
a
disturbance
in
fontainebleau
it
did
not
take
long
to
get
spread
about
the
town
that
m
martout
and
the
messieurs
renault
intended
in
conjunction
with
several
paris
savans
to
resuscitate
a
dead
man
m
martout
had
sent
a
detailed
account
of
the
case
to
the
celebrated
karl
nibor
who
had
hastened
to
lay
it
before
the
biological
society
a
committee
was
forthwith
appointed
to
accompany
m
nibor
to
fontainebleau
the
six
commissioners
and
the
reporter
agreed
to
leave
paris
the
th
of
august
being
glad
to
escape
the
din
of
the
public
rejoicings
m
martout
was
notified
to
get
things
ready
for
the
experiment
which
would
probably
last
not
less
than
three
days
some
of
the
paris
papers
announced
this
great
event
among
their
miscellaneous
items
but
the
public
paid
little
attention
to
it
the
grand
reception
of
the
army
returning
from
italy
engrossed
everybodys
interest
and
moreover
the
french
do
not
put
more
than
moderate
faith
in
miracles
promised
in
the
newspapers
but
at
fontainebleau
it
was
an
entirely
different
matter
not
only
monsieur
martout
and
the
messieurs
renault
but
m
audret
the
architect
m
bonnivet
the
notary
and
a
dozen
other
of
the
bigwigs
of
the
town
had
seen
and
touched
the
mummy
of
the
colonel
they
had
spoken
about
it
to
their
friends
had
described
it
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
had
recounted
its
history
two
or
three
copies
of
herr
meisers
will
were
circulating
from
hand
to
hand
the
question
of
reanimations
was
the
order
of
the
day
they
discussed
it
around
the
fishpond
like
the
academy
of
sciences
at
a
full
meeting
even
in
the
marketplace
you
could
have
heard
them
talking
about
rotifers
and
tardigrades
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
resuscitationists
were
not
in
the
majority
a
few
professors
of
the
college
noted
for
the
paradoxical
character
of
their
minds
a
few
lovers
of
the
marvellous
who
had
been
duly
convicted
of
tabletipping
and
to
top
off
with
a
half
dozen
of
those
old
whitemoustached
grumblers
who
believe
that
the
death
of
napoleon
i
is
a
calumnious
lie
set
afloat
by
the
english
constituted
the
whole
of
the
army
m
martout
had
against
him
not
only
the
skeptics
but
the
innumerable
crowd
of
believers
in
the
bargain
one
party
turned
him
to
ridicule
the
others
proclaimed
him
revolutionary
dangerous
and
an
enemy
of
the
fundamental
ideas
on
which
society
rests
the
minister
of
one
little
church
preached
in
inuendoes
against
the
prometheuses
who
aspired
to
usurp
the
prerogatives
of
heaven
but
the
rector
of
the
parish
did
not
hesitate
to
say
in
five
or
six
houses
that
the
cure
of
a
man
as
desperately
sick
as
m
fougas
would
be
an
evidence
of
the
power
and
mercy
of
god
the
garrison
of
fontainebleau
was
at
that
time
composed
of
four
squadrons
of
cuirassiers
and
the
d
regiment
of
the
line
which
had
distinguished
itself
at
magenta
as
soon
as
it
was
known
in
colonel
fougas
old
regiment
that
that
illustrious
officer
was
possibly
going
to
return
to
the
world
there
was
a
general
sensation
a
regiment
knows
its
history
and
the
history
of
the
d
had
been
that
of
fougas
from
february
to
november
all
the
soldiers
had
heard
read
at
their
messes
the
following
anecdote
on
the
th
of
august
at
the
battle
of
dresden
the
emperor
noticed
a
french
regiment
at
the
foot
of
a
russian
redoubt
which
was
pouring
grape
upon
it
he
asked
what
regiment
it
was
and
was
told
that
it
was
the
d
of
the
line
thats
impossible
said
he
the
d
of
the
line
never
stood
under
fire
without
rushing
upon
the
artillery
thundering
at
it
at
that
moment
the
d
led
by
colonel
fougas
rushed
up
the
height
at
double
quick
pinned
the
artillerists
to
their
guns
and
took
the
redoubt
the
officers
and
soldiers
justly
proud
of
this
memorable
action
venerated
under
the
name
of
fougas
one
of
the
fathers
of
the
regiment
the
idea
of
seeing
him
appear
in
the
midst
of
them
young
and
living
did
not
appear
likely
but
it
was
already
something
to
be
in
possession
of
his
body
officers
and
soldiers
decided
that
he
should
be
interred
at
their
expense
after
the
experiments
of
doctor
martout
were
completed
and
to
give
him
a
tomb
worthy
of
his
glory
they
voted
an
assessment
of
two
days
pay
every
one
who
wore
an
epaulette
visited
m
renaults
laboratory
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
went
there
several
timesin
hopes
of
meeting
clementine
but
leons
betrothed
kept
herself
out
of
the
way
she
was
happier
than
any
woman
had
ever
been
this
pretty
little
clementine
no
cloud
longer
disturbed
the
serenity
of
her
fair
brow
free
from
all
anxieties
with
a
heart
opened
to
hope
she
adored
her
dear
leon
and
passed
her
days
in
telling
him
so
she
herself
had
pressed
the
publication
of
the
bans
we
will
be
married
said
she
the
day
after
the
resuscitation
of
the
colonel
i
intend
that
he
shall
give
me
away
i
want
him
to
bless
me
that
is
certainly
the
least
he
can
do
for
me
after
all
i
have
done
for
him
it
is
certain
that
but
for
my
opposition
you
would
have
sent
him
to
the
museum
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
i
will
tell
him
all
this
sir
as
soon
as
he
can
understand
us
and
he
will
cut
your
ears
off
in
his
turn
i
love
you
but
answered
leon
why
do
you
make
my
happiness
dependent
on
the
success
of
an
experiment
all
the
usual
formalities
are
executed
the
publications
made
the
notices
given
no
one
in
the
world
can
prevent
our
marrying
tomorrow
and
you
are
pleased
to
wait
until
the
th
what
connection
is
there
between
us
and
this
desiccated
gentleman
asleep
in
his
box
he
doesnt
belong
to
your
family
or
mine
i
have
examined
all
your
family
records
back
to
the
sixth
generation
and
i
havent
found
anybody
of
the
name
of
fougas
in
them
so
we
are
not
waiting
for
a
grandfather
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
who
is
he
then
the
wicked
tongues
of
fontainebleau
pretend
that
you
have
a
penchant
for
this
fetich
of
as
for
me
who
am
sure
of
your
heart
i
trust
that
you
will
never
love
any
one
as
well
as
me
however
they
call
me
the
rival
of
the
sleeping
colonel
in
the
wood
let
the
fools
prate
responded
clementine
with
an
angelic
smile
i
do
not
trouble
myself
to
explain
my
affection
for
poor
fougas
but
i
love
him
very
much
thats
certain
i
love
him
as
a
father
as
a
brother
if
you
prefer
it
for
he
is
almost
as
young
as
i
when
we
have
resuscitated
him
i
will
love
him
perhaps
as
a
son
but
you
will
lose
nothing
by
it
dear
leon
you
have
in
my
heart
a
place
by
itself
the
best
too
and
no
one
shall
take
it
from
you
not
even
he
this
lovers
quarrel
which
often
began
and
always
ended
with
a
kiss
was
one
day
interrupted
by
a
visit
from
the
commissioner
of
police
this
honorable
functionary
politely
declined
to
give
his
name
and
business
and
requested
the
favor
of
a
private
interview
with
young
renault
monsieur
said
he
when
he
saw
him
alone
i
appreciate
all
the
consideration
due
to
a
man
of
your
character
and
position
and
i
hope
you
will
see
fit
not
to
interpret
unpleasantly
a
proceeding
which
is
prompted
in
me
by
a
sense
of
duty
leon
opened
his
eyes
and
waited
for
the
continuation
of
the
discourse
you
are
aware
monsieur
pursued
the
commissioner
of
what
is
required
by
the
law
concerning
interments
it
is
express
and
admits
no
exception
the
authorities
can
keep
their
eyes
shut
but
the
great
tumult
that
has
arisen
and
moreover
the
rank
of
the
deceased
without
taking
into
account
the
religious
considerations
put
us
under
obligation
to
proceed
in
conjunction
with
you
let
it
be
well
understood
leon
comprehended
little
by
little
the
commissioner
finished
by
explaining
to
him
always
in
the
administrative
style
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
have
m
fougas
taken
to
the
town
cemetery
but
monsieur
replied
the
engineer
if
you
have
heard
people
speaking
of
colonel
fougas
they
ought
to
have
told
you
withal
that
we
do
not
consider
him
dead
nonsense
answered
the
commissioner
with
a
slight
smile
opinions
are
free
but
the
doctor
whose
office
it
is
to
attend
to
the
disposition
of
the
dead
and
who
has
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
deceased
has
made
us
a
conclusive
report
which
points
to
immediate
interment
very
well
monsieur
if
fougas
is
dead
we
are
in
hopes
of
resuscitating
him
so
we
have
been
told
already
monsieur
but
for
my
part
i
hesitated
to
believe
it
you
will
believe
it
when
you
have
seen
it
and
i
hope
monsieur
that
that
will
be
before
long
but
then
monsieur
have
you
fixed
everything
in
due
form
with
whom
i
do
not
know
monsieur
but
i
suppose
that
before
undertaking
such
a
thing
as
this
you
have
fortified
yourself
with
some
legal
authorization
from
whom
but
at
all
events
monsieur
you
admit
that
the
reanimation
of
a
man
is
an
extraordinary
affair
as
for
myself
this
is
really
the
first
time
that
i
ever
heard
it
spoken
of
now
the
duty
of
a
well
regulated
police
is
to
prevent
anything
extraordinary
happening
in
the
country
let
us
see
monsieur
if
i
were
to
say
to
you
here
is
a
man
who
is
not
dead
i
have
a
wellfounded
hope
of
setting
him
on
his
feet
in
three
days
your
doctor
who
maintains
the
contrary
deceives
himself
would
you
take
the
responsibility
of
having
fougas
buried
certainly
not
god
forbid
that
i
should
take
any
responsibility
of
any
kind
on
my
shoulders
but
however
monsieur
in
having
m
fougas
buried
i
would
act
in
accordance
with
law
and
order
now
after
all
by
what
right
do
you
presume
to
resuscitate
a
man
in
what
country
is
resuscitation
customary
where
is
the
precept
of
law
which
authorizes
you
to
resuscitate
people
do
you
know
any
law
that
prohibits
it
now
everything
that
is
not
prohibited
is
permitted
in
the
eyes
of
the
magistrates
very
likely
but
the
police
ought
to
prevent
and
stem
disorder
now
a
resuscitation
monsieur
is
a
thing
so
unheard
of
as
to
constitute
an
actual
disorder
you
will
admit
nevertheless
that
it
is
a
very
happy
disorder
theres
no
such
thing
as
a
happy
disorder
consider
morever
that
the
deceased
is
not
a
common
sort
of
a
man
if
the
question
concerned
a
vagabond
without
house
or
home
one
could
use
some
tolerance
in
regard
to
it
but
this
is
a
soldier
an
officer
of
high
rank
and
decorated
too
a
man
who
has
occupied
an
exalted
position
in
the
army
the
army
monsieur
it
will
not
do
to
touch
the
army
eh
monsieur
i
touch
the
army
like
a
surgeon
who
tends
its
wounds
it
is
proposed
to
restore
to
the
army
a
colonel
and
you
actuated
by
the
spirit
of
routine
wish
to
rob
it
of
one
dont
get
so
excited
monsieur
i
beg
of
you
and
dont
talk
so
loud
people
can
hear
us
believe
me
i
will
meet
you
half
way
in
anything
you
want
to
do
for
the
great
and
glorious
army
of
my
country
but
have
you
considered
the
religious
question
what
religious
question
to
tell
you
the
truth
monsieur
but
this
entirely
between
ourselves
what
we
have
spoken
of
so
far
is
purely
accessory
and
we
are
now
touching
upon
the
delicate
point
people
have
come
to
see
me
and
have
made
some
very
judicious
remarks
to
me
the
mere
announcement
of
your
project
has
cast
a
good
deal
of
trouble
into
certain
consciences
they
fear
that
the
success
of
an
undertaking
of
this
kind
may
strike
a
blow
at
the
faith
may
in
a
word
scandalize
many
tranquil
spirits
for
if
m
fougas
is
dead
of
course
it
is
because
god
has
so
willed
it
arent
you
afraid
of
acting
contrary
to
the
will
of
god
in
resuscitating
him
no
monsieur
for
i
am
sure
not
to
resuscitate
fougas
if
god
has
willed
it
otherwise
god
permits
a
man
to
catch
the
fever
but
god
also
permits
a
doctor
to
cure
him
god
permitted
a
brave
soldier
of
the
emperor
to
be
captured
by
four
drunken
russians
condemned
as
a
spy
frozen
in
a
fortress
and
desiccated
under
an
airpump
by
an
old
german
but
god
also
permitted
me
to
find
this
unfortunate
man
in
a
junkshop
to
carry
him
to
fontainebleau
to
examine
him
with
certain
men
of
science
and
to
agree
with
them
upon
a
method
almost
sure
to
restore
him
to
life
all
this
proves
one
thingwhich
is
that
god
is
more
just
more
merciful
and
more
inclined
to
pity
than
those
who
abuse
his
name
in
order
to
excite
you
i
assure
you
monsieur
that
i
am
not
in
the
least
excited
i
yield
to
your
reasons
because
they
are
good
ones
and
because
you
are
a
man
of
consideration
in
the
community
i
sincerely
hope
moreover
that
you
will
not
think
harshly
of
an
act
of
zeal
which
i
have
been
advised
to
perform
i
am
a
functionary
monsieur
now
what
is
a
functionary
a
man
who
holds
a
place
suppose
now
that
functionaries
were
to
expose
themselves
to
the
loss
of
their
places
what
would
stand
firm
in
france
nothing
monsieur
absolutely
nothing
i
have
the
honor
to
bid
you
good
day
on
the
morning
of
the
th
of
august
m
karl
nibor
presented
himself
at
m
renaults
with
doctor
martont
and
the
committee
appointed
by
the
biological
society
of
paris
as
often
happens
in
the
rural
districts
the
first
appearance
of
our
illustrious
savant
was
a
sort
of
disappointment
mme
renault
expected
to
see
if
not
a
magician
in
a
velvet
robe
studded
with
gold
at
least
an
old
man
of
extraordinarily
grave
and
impressive
appearance
karl
nibor
is
a
man
of
middle
height
very
fair
and
very
slight
possibly
he
carries
a
good
forty
years
but
one
would
not
credit
him
with
more
than
thirtyfive
he
wears
a
moustache
and
imperial
is
lively
a
good
conversationist
agreeable
and
enough
of
a
man
of
the
world
to
amuse
the
ladies
but
clementine
did
not
have
the
pleasure
of
his
conversation
her
aunt
had
taken
her
to
moret
in
order
to
remove
her
from
the
pangs
of
fear
as
well
as
from
the
intoxications
of
victory
chapter
x
hallelujah
m
nibor
and
his
colleagues
after
the
usual
compliments
requested
to
see
the
subject
they
had
no
time
to
lose
as
the
experiment
could
hardly
last
less
than
three
days
leon
hastened
to
conduct
them
to
the
laboratory
and
to
open
the
three
boxes
containing
the
colonel
they
found
that
the
patient
presented
quite
a
favorable
appearance
m
nibor
took
off
his
clothes
which
tore
like
tinder
from
having
been
too
much
dried
in
father
meisers
furnace
the
body
when
naked
was
pronounced
entirely
free
from
blemish
and
in
a
perfectly
healthy
condition
no
one
would
yet
have
guaranteed
success
but
every
one
was
full
of
hope
after
this
preliminary
examination
m
renault
put
his
laboratory
at
the
service
of
his
guests
he
offered
them
all
that
he
possessed
with
a
munificence
which
was
not
entirely
free
from
vanity
in
case
the
employment
of
electricity
should
appear
necessary
he
had
a
powerful
battery
of
leyden
jars
and
forty
of
bunsens
elements
which
were
entirely
new
m
nibor
thanked
him
smilingly
save
your
riches
said
he
with
a
bathtub
and
caldron
of
boiling
water
we
will
have
everything
we
need
the
colonel
needs
nothing
but
humidity
the
thing
is
to
give
him
the
quantity
of
water
necessary
to
the
play
of
the
organs
if
you
have
a
small
room
where
one
can
introduce
a
jet
of
vapor
we
will
be
more
than
content
m
audret
the
architect
had
very
wisely
built
a
little
bathroom
near
the
laboratory
which
was
convenient
and
well
lighted
the
celebrated
steam
engine
was
not
far
off
and
its
boiler
had
not
up
to
this
time
answered
any
other
purpose
than
that
of
warming
the
baths
of
m
and
mme
renault
the
colonel
was
carried
into
this
room
with
all
the
care
necessitated
by
his
fragility
it
was
not
intended
to
break
his
second
ear
in
the
hurry
of
moving
leon
ran
to
light
the
fire
under
the
boiler
and
m
nibor
created
him
fireman
on
the
field
of
battle
soon
a
jet
of
tepid
vapor
streamed
into
the
bathroom
creating
around
the
colonel
a
humid
atmosphere
which
was
elevated
by
degrees
and
without
any
sudden
increase
to
the
temperature
of
the
human
body
these
conditions
of
heat
and
humidity
were
maintained
with
the
greatest
care
for
twentyfour
hours
no
one
in
the
house
went
to
sleep
the
members
of
the
parisian
committee
encamped
in
the
laboratory
leon
kept
up
the
fire
m
nibor
m
renault
and
m
martout
took
turns
in
watching
the
thermometer
madame
renault
was
making
tea
and
coffee
and
punch
too
gothon
who
had
taken
communion
in
the
morning
kept
praying
to
god
in
the
corner
of
her
kitchen
that
this
impious
miracle
might
not
succeed
a
certain
excitement
already
prevailed
throughout
the
town
but
one
did
not
know
whether
it
should
be
attributed
to
the
fête
of
the
th
or
the
famous
undertaking
of
the
seven
wise
men
of
paris
by
two
oclock
on
the
th
encouraging
results
were
obtained
the
skin
and
muscles
had
recovered
nearly
all
their
suppleness
but
the
joints
were
still
hard
to
bend
the
collapsed
condition
of
the
walls
of
the
abdomen
and
the
interval
between
the
ribs
still
indicated
that
the
viscera
were
far
from
having
reabsorbed
the
quantity
of
water
which
they
had
previously
lost
with
herr
meiser
a
bath
was
prepared
and
kept
at
a
temperature
of
thirtyseven
degrees
and
a
half
they
left
the
colonel
in
it
two
hours
and
a
half
taking
care
to
frequently
pass
over
his
head
a
fine
sponge
soaked
with
water
m
nibor
removed
him
from
the
bath
as
soon
as
the
skin
which
was
filled
out
sooner
than
the
other
tissues
began
to
assume
a
whitish
tinge
and
wrinkle
slightly
they
kept
him
until
the
evening
of
the
th
in
this
humid
room
where
they
arranged
an
apparatus
which
from
time
to
time
occasioned
a
fine
rain
of
a
temperature
of
thirtyseven
and
a
half
degrees
a
new
bath
was
given
in
the
evening
during
the
night
the
body
was
enveloped
in
flannel
but
kept
constantly
in
the
same
steaming
atmosphere
on
the
morning
of
the
th
after
a
third
bath
of
an
hour
and
a
half
the
general
characteristics
of
the
figure
and
the
proportions
of
the
body
presented
their
natural
aspect
one
would
have
called
it
a
sleeping
man
five
or
six
curious
persons
were
admitted
to
see
it
among
others
the
colonel
of
the
d
in
the
presence
of
these
witnesses
m
nibor
moved
successively
all
the
joints
and
demonstrated
that
they
had
recovered
their
flexibility
he
gently
kneaded
the
limbs
trunk
and
abdomen
he
partly
opened
the
lips
and
separated
the
jaws
which
were
quite
firmly
closed
and
saw
that
the
tongue
had
returned
to
its
ordinary
size
and
consistency
he
also
partly
opened
the
eyelids
the
eyeballs
were
firm
and
bright
gentlemen
said
the
philosopher
these
are
indications
which
do
not
deceive
i
prophesy
success
in
a
few
hours
you
shall
witness
the
first
manifestations
of
life
but
interrupted
one
of
the
bystanders
why
not
immediately
because
the
conjunctivæ
are
still
a
little
paler
than
they
ought
to
be
but
the
little
veins
traversing
the
whites
of
the
eyes
have
already
assumed
a
very
encouraging
appearance
the
blood
is
almost
entirely
restored
what
is
the
blood
red
globules
floating
in
serum
or
a
sort
of
whey
the
serum
in
poor
fougas
was
dried
up
in
his
veins
the
water
which
we
have
gradually
introduced
by
a
slow
endosmose
has
saturated
the
albumen
and
fibrin
of
the
serum
which
is
returned
to
the
liquid
state
the
red
globules
which
desiccation
had
agglutinated
had
become
motionless
like
ships
stranded
in
shoal
water
now
behold
them
afloat
again
they
thicken
swell
round
out
their
edges
detach
themselves
from
each
other
and
prepare
to
circulate
in
their
proper
channels
at
the
first
impulse
which
shall
be
given
them
by
the
contractions
of
the
heart
it
remains
to
see
said
m
renault
whether
the
heart
will
put
itself
in
motion
in
a
living
man
the
heart
moves
under
the
impulse
of
the
brain
transmitted
by
the
nerves
the
brain
acts
under
the
impulse
of
the
heart
transmitted
by
the
arteries
the
whole
forms
a
perfectly
exact
circle
without
which
there
is
no
wellbeing
and
when
neither
heart
nor
brain
acts
as
in
the
colonels
case
i
dont
see
which
of
the
two
can
set
the
other
in
motion
you
remember
the
scene
in
the
ecole
des
femmes
where
arnolphe
knocks
at
his
door
the
valet
and
the
maid
alain
and
georgette
are
both
in
the
house
georgette
cries
alainwell
replies

the

me
i
shant
goi
shant
go
eitheropen
it
right
awayopen
it
yourself
and
nobody
opens
it
i
am
inclined
to
think
monsieur
that
we
are
attending
a
performance
of
this
comedy
the
house
is
the
body
of
the
colonel
arnolphe
who
wants
to
get
in
is
the
vital
principle
the
heart
and
brain
act
the
parts
of
alain
and
georgette
open
the
door
says
oneopen
it
yourself
says
the
other
and
the
vital
principle
waits
outside
monsieur
replied
doctor
nibor
smiling
you
forget
the
ending
of
the
scene
arnolphe
gets
angry
and
cries
out
whichever
of
you
two
doesnt
open
the
door
shant
have
anything
to
eat
for
four
days
and
forthwith
alain
hurries
himself
georgette
runs
and
the
door
is
opened
now
bear
in
mind
that
i
speak
in
this
way
only
in
order
to
conform
to
your
own
course
of
reasoning
for
the
term
vital
principle
is
at
variance
with
the
actual
assertions
of
science
life
will
manifest
itself
as
soon
as
the
brain
or
the
heart
or
any
one
of
the
organs
which
have
the
capacity
of
working
spontaneously
shall
have
absorbed
the
quantity
of
water
it
needs
organized
matter
has
inherent
properties
which
manifest
themselves
without
the
assistance
of
any
foreign
principle
whenever
they
are
surrounded
by
certain
conditions
why
do
not
m
fougas
muscles
contract
yet
why
does
not
the
tissue
of
the
brain
enter
into
action
because
they
have
not
yet
the
amount
of
moisture
necessary
to
them
in
the
fountain
of
life
there
is
lacking
perhaps
a
pint
of
water
but
i
shall
be
in
no
hurry
to
refill
it
i
am
too
much
afraid
of
breaking
it
before
giving
this
gallant
fellow
a
final
bath
it
will
be
necessary
to
knead
all
his
organs
again
to
subject
his
abdomen
to
regular
compressions
in
order
that
the
serous
membranes
of
the
stomach
chest
and
heart
may
be
perfectly
disagglutinated
and
capable
of
slipping
on
each
other
you
are
aware
that
the
slightest
tear
in
these
parts
or
the
least
resistance
would
be
enough
to
kill
our
subject
at
the
moment
of
his
revival
while
speaking
he
united
example
to
precept
and
kept
kneading
the
trunk
of
the
colonel
as
the
spectators
had
too
nearly
filled
the
bathroom
making
it
almost
impossible
to
move
m
nibor
begged
them
to
move
into
the
laboratory
but
the
laboratory
became
so
full
that
it
was
necessary
to
leave
it
for
the
parlor
the
committee
of
the
biological
society
had
scarcely
a
corner
of
the
table
on
which
to
draw
up
their
account
of
the
proceedings
the
parlor
even
was
crowded
with
people
the
dining
room
too
and
so
out
to
the
court
yard
of
the
house
friends
strangers
people
not
at
all
known
to
the
family
elbowed
each
other
and
waited
in
silence
but
the
silence
of
a
crowd
is
not
much
less
noisy
than
the
rolling
of
the
sea
fat
doctor
martout
apparently
overwhelmed
with
responsibility
showed
himself
from
time
to
time
and
surged
through
the
waves
of
curious
people
like
a
galleon
laden
with
news
every
one
of
his
words
circulated
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
spread
even
through
the
street
where
several
groups
of
soldiers
and
citizens
were
making
a
stir
in
more
senses
than
one
never
had
the
little
rue
de
la
faisanderie
seen
such
a
crowd
an
astonished
passerby
stopped
and
inquired
whats
the
matter
here
is
it
a
funeral
quite
the
reverse
sir
a
christening
then
with
warm
water
a
birth
a
being
born
again
an
old
judge
of
the
civil
court
was
recounting
to
a
deputy
the
legend
of
æson
of
old
who
was
boiled
in
medeas
caldron
this
is
almost
the
same
experiment
said
he
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
poets
have
calumniated
the
sorceress
of
colchis
there
could
be
some
fine
latin
verses
made
appropriate
to
this
occasion
but
i
no
longer
possess
my
old
skill
fabula

carpit
iniquo
ecce
novus

æson
ab

fortior
arma
petens

miles
redivivus
is
taken
in
the
active
sense
its
a
license
or
at
least
a
bold
construction
ah
monsieur
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
even
among
those
who
made
the
most
confident
attempts
the
man
for
latin
verses
corpral
said
a
conscript
of
the
levy
of
what
is
it
freminot
is
it
true
that
they
are
boiling
an
old
soldier
in
a
pot
and
that
they
are
going
to
get
him
up
again
colonels
uniform
and
all
true
or
not
subaltern
ill
run
the
risk
of
saying
its
true
i
fancy
with
all
proper
deference
that
they
will
not
make
much
at
it
you
should
know
freminot
that
nothing
is
impossible
to
your
superiors
you
are
not
unaware
even
now
that
dried
vegetables
on
being
boiled
recover
their
original
and
natural
appearance
but
corpral
if
one
were
to
cook
them
three
days
time
theyd
dissolve
into
broth
but
imbecile
why
shouldnt
one
consider
old
soldiers
hard
to
cook
at
noon
the
commisioner
of
police
and
the
lieutenant
of
gensdarmes
made
way
through
the
crowd
and
entered
the
house
these
gentlemen
hastened
to
declare
to
m
renault
that
their
visit
had
nothing
of
an
official
character
but
that
they
had
come
merely
from
curiosity
in
the
corridor
they
met
the
subprefect
the
mayor
and
gothon
who
was
lamenting
in
loud
tones
that
she
should
see
the
government
lend
its
hand
to
such
sorceries
about
one
oclock
m
nibor
caused
a
new
and
prolonged
bath
to
be
given
the
colonel
on
coming
out
of
which
the
body
was
subjected
to
a
kneading
harder
and
more
complete
than
before
now
said
the
doctor
we
can
carry
m
fougas
into
the
laboratory
in
order
to
give
his
resuscitation
all
the
publicity
desirable
but
it
will
be
well
to
dress
him
and
his
uniform
is
in
tatters
i
think
answered
good
m
renault
that
the
colonel
is
about
my
size
so
i
can
lend
him
some
of
my
clothes
heaven
grant
that
he
may
use
them
but
between
us
i
dont
hope
for
it
gothon
brought
in
grumbling
all
that
was
necessary
to
dress
an
entirely
naked
man
but
her
bad
humor
did
not
hold
out
before
the
beauty
of
the
colonel
poor
gentleman
she
exclaimed
he
is
young
fresh
and
fair
as
a
little
chicken
if
he
doesnt
revive
it
will
be
a
great
pity
there
were
about
forty
people
in
the
laboratory
when
fougas
was
carried
thither
m
nibor
assisted
by
m
martout
placed
him
on
a
sofa
and
begged
a
few
moments
of
attentive
silence
during
these
proceedings
mme
renault
sent
to
inquire
if
she
could
come
in
she
was
admitted
madame
and
gentlemen
said
dr
nibor
life
will
manifest
itself
in
a
few
minutes
it
is
possible
that
the
muscles
will
act
first
and
that
their
action
may
be
convulsive
on
account
of
not
yet
being
regulated
by
the
influence
of
the
nervous
system
i
ought
to
apprise
you
of
this
fact
in
order
that
you
may
not
be
frightened
if
such
a
thing
transpires
madame
being
a
mother
ought
to
be
less
astonished
at
it
than
any
one
else
she
has
experienced
at
the
fourth
month
of
pregnancy
the
effect
of
those
irregular
movements
which
will
possibly
soon
be
presented
to
us
on
a
larger
scale
i
am
quite
hopeful
however
that
the
first
spontaneous
contractions
will
take
place
in
the
fibres
of
the
heart
such
is
the
case
in
the
embryo
where
the
rhythmic
movements
of
the
heart
precede
the
nervous
functions
he
again
began
making
systematic
compressions
of
the
lower
part
of
the
chest
rubbing
the
skin
with
his
hands
half
opening
the
eyelids
examining
the
pulse
and
auscultating
the
region
of
the
heart
the
attention
of
the
spectators
was
diverted
an
instant
by
a
hubbub
outside
a
battalion
of
the
d
was
passing
with
music
at
the
head
through
the
rue
de
la
faisanderie
while
the
saxhorns
were
shaking
the
windows
a
sudden
flash
mantled
on
the
cheeks
of
the
colonel
his
eyes
which
had
stood
half
open
lit
up
with
a
brighter
sparkle
at
the
same
instant
doctor
nibor
who
had
his
ear
applied
to
the
chest
cried
i
hear
the
beatings
of
the
heart
scarcely
had
he
spoken
when
the
chest
rose
with
a
violent
inspiration
the
limbs
contracted
the
body
straightened
up
and
out
came
a
cry
vive
lempereur
but
as
if
so
great
an
effort
had
overtasked
his
strength
colonel
fougas
fell
back
on
the
sofa
murmuring
in
a
subdued
voice
where
am
i
waiter
bring
me
a
newspaper
chapter
xi
wherein
colonel
fougas
learns
some
news
which
will
appear
old
to
my
readers
among
all
the
persons
present
at
this
scene
there
was
not
a
single
one
who
had
ever
seen
a
resuscitation
i
leave
you
to
imagine
the
surprise
and
joy
which
reigned
in
the
laboratory
a
triple
round
of
applause
mingled
with
cheers
hailed
the
triumph
of
doctor
nibor
the
crowd
packed
in
the
parlor
the
passages
the
courtyard
and
even
in
the
street
understood
at
this
signal
that
the
miracle
was
accomplished
nothing
could
hold
them
back
they
forced
the
doors
cleared
all
obstacles
upset
all
the
philosophers
who
tried
to
stop
them
and
finished
by
pouring
into
the
chamber
of
science
gentlemen
cried
m
nibor
do
you
want
to
kill
him
but
they
let
him
talk
the
wildest
of
all
passions
curiosity
had
long
held
dominion
over
the
crowd
every
one
wanted
to
see
though
at
the
risk
of
crushing
the
others
m
nibor
tumbled
down
m
renault
and
his
son
in
attempting
to
help
him
were
thrown
on
top
of
him
madame
renault
in
her
turn
was
thrown
down
at
the
feet
of
fougas
and
began
screaming
at
the
top
of
her
voice
damnation
said
fougas
straightening
himself
up
as
if
by
a
spring
these
scoundrels
will
suffocate
us
if
some
one
doesnt
squelch
them
his
attitude
the
glare
of
his
eyes
and
above
all
the
prestige
of
the
miraculous
cleared
a
space
around
him
one
would
have
thought
that
the
walls
had
been
stretched
or
that
the
spectators
had
slid
into
one
another
out
of
here
every
mothers
son
of
you
cried
fougas
in
his
fiercest
tone
of
command
a
tumult
of
cries
explanations
and
remonstrances
was
raised
around
him
he
fancied
he
heard
menaces
he
seized
the
first
chair
within
reach
brandished
it
like
a
weapon
drove
hammered
upset
the
citizens
soldiers
officials
savants
friends
sightseers
commissary
of
policeeverybody
and
urged
the
human
torrent
into
the
street
with
an
uproar
perfectly
indescribable
this
done
he
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
returned
to
the
laboratory
saw
three
men
standing
near
madame
renault
and
said
to
the
old
lady
softening
the
tone
of
his
voice
well
good
mother
shall
i
serve
these
three
like
the
others
no
no
no
be
careful
cried
the
good
old
lady
my
husband
and
my
son
monsieur
and
doctor
nibor
who
has
restored
you
to
life
in
that
case
all
honor
to
them
good
mother
fougas
has
never
violated
the
laws
of
gratitude
and
hospitality
as
for
you
my
esculapius
give
me
your
hand
at
the
same
instant
he
noticed
ten
or
a
dozen
inquisitive
people
on
tiptoe
on
the
pavement
just
by
the
windows
of
the
laboratory
forthwith
he
marched
and
opened
them
with
a
precipitation
which
upset
the
gazers
among
the
crowd
people
said
he
i
have
knocked
down
a
hundred
beggarly
pandours
who
respect
neither
sex
nor
infirmity
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
satisfied
i
will
state
that
i
call
myself
colonel
fougas
of
the
d
and
vive
lempereur
a
confused
mixture
of
plaudits
cries
laughs
and
jeers
answered
this
unprecedented
allocution
leon
renault
hastened
out
to
make
apologies
to
all
to
whom
they
were
due
he
invited
a
few
friends
to
dine
the
same
evening
with
the
terrible
colonel
and
of
course
he
did
not
forget
to
send
a
special
messenger
to
clementine
fougas
after
speaking
to
the
people
returned
to
his
hosts
swinging
himself
along
with
a
swaggering
air
set
himself
astride
a
chair
took
hold
of
the
ends
of
his
moustache
and
said
well
come
lets
talk
this
over
ive
been
sick
then
very
sick
thats
fabulous
i
feel
entirely
well
im
hungry
and
moreover
while
waiting
for
dinner
ill
even
try
a
glass
of
your
schnick
mme
renault
went
out
gave
an
order
and
returned
in
an
instant
but
tell
me
then
where
i
am
resumed
the
colonel
by
these
paraphernalia
of
work
i
recognize
a
disciple
of
urania
possibly
a
friend
of
monge
and
berthollet
but
the
cordial
friendliness
impressed
on
your
countenances
proves
to
me
that
you
are
not
natives
of
this
land
of
sourkrout
yes
i
believe
it
from
the
beatings
of
my
heart
friends
we
have
the
same
fatherland
the
kindness
of
your
reception
even
were
there
no
other
indications
would
have
satisfied
me
that
you
are
french
what
accidents
have
brought
you
so
far
from
our
native
soil
children
of
my
country
what
tempest
has
thrown
you
upon
this
inhospitable
shore
my
dear
colonel
replied
m
nibor
if
you
want
to
become
very
wise
you
will
not
ask
so
many
questions
at
once
allow
us
the
pleasure
of
instructing
you
quietly
and
in
order
for
you
have
a
great
many
things
to
learn
the
colonel
flushed
with
anger
and
answered
sharply
at
all
events
you
are
not
the
man
to
teach
them
to
me
my
little
gentleman
a
drop
of
blood
which
fell
on
his
hand
changed
the
current
of
his
thoughts
hold
on
said
he
am
i
bleeding
that
will
amount
to
nothing
circulation
is
reëstablished
and
your
broken
ear
he
quickly
carried
his
hand
to
his
ear
and
said
its
certainly
so
but
devil
take
me
if
i
recollect
this
accident
ill
make
you
a
little
dressing
and
in
a
couple
of
days
there
will
be
no
trace
of
it
left
dont
give
yourself
the
trouble
my
dear
hippocrates
a
pinch
of
powder
is
a
sovereign
cure
m
nibor
set
to
work
to
dress
the
ear
in
a
little
less
military
fashion
during
his
operations
leon
reëntered
ah
ah
said
he
to
the
doctor
you
are
repairing
the
harm
i
did
thunderation
cried
fougas
escaping
from
the
hands
of
m
nibor
so
as
to
seize
leon
by
the
collar
was
it
you
you
rascal
that
hurt
my
ear
leon
was
very
goodnatured
but
his
patience
failed
him
he
pushed
his
man
roughly
aside
yes
sir
it
was
i
who
tore
your
ear
in
pulling
it
and
if
that
little
misfortune
had
not
happened
to
me
it
is
certain
that
you
would
have
been
today
six
feet
under
ground
it
is
i
who
saved
your
life
after
buying
you
with
my
money
when
you
were
not
valued
at
more
than
twentyfive
louis
it
is
i
who
have
passed
three
days
and
two
nights
in
cramming
charcoal
under
your
boiler
it
is
my
father
who
gave
you
the
clothes
you
now
have
on
you
are
in
our
house
drink
the
little
glass
of
brandy
gothon
just
brought
you
but
for
gods
sake
give
up
the
habit
of
calling
me
rascal
of
calling
my
mother
good
mother
and
of
flinging
our
friends
into
the
street
and
calling
them
beggarly
pandours
the
colonel
all
dumbfounded
held
out
his
hand
to
leon
m
renault
and
the
doctor
gallantly
kissed
the
hand
of
mme
renault
swallowed
at
a
gulp
a
claret
glass
filled
to
the
brim
with
brandy
and
said
in
a
subdued
voice
most
excellent
friends
forget
the
vagaries
of
an
impulsive
but
generous
soul
to
subdue
my
passions
shall
hereafter
be
my
law
after
conquering
all
the
nations
in
the
universe
it
is
well
to
conquer
ones
self
this
said
he
submitted
his
ear
to
m
nibor
who
finished
dressing
it
but
said
he
summoning
up
his
recollections
they
did
not
shoot
me
then
no
and
i
wasnt
frozen
to
death
in
the
tower
not
quite
why
has
my
uniform
been
taken
off
i
see
i
am
a
prisoner
you
are
free
free
vive
lempereur
but
then
theres
not
a
moment
to
lose
how
many
leagues
is
it
to
dantzic
its
very
far
what
do
you

this
chicken
coop
of
a
town
fontainebleau
fontainebleau
in
france
prefecture
of
seineetmarne
we
are
going
to
introduce
to
you

subprefect
whom

into
the
street
what
the
devil

your
subprefects

me

day

dantzic
god

whether
ill
be
there
in
time
my
poor
colonel
you
will
arrive
too
late
dantzic
is
given
up
thats
impossible
since
when
about
fortysix
years
ago
thunder
i
did
not
understand
that
you
were
mocking
me
m
nibor
placed
in
his
hand
a
calendar
and
said
see
for
yourself
it
is
now
the
th
of
august
you
went
to
sleep
in
the
tower
of
liebenfeld
on
the
th
of
november
there
have
been
then
fortysix
years
all
to
three
months
during
which
the
world
has
moved
on
without
you
twentyfour
and
fortysix
but
then
i
would
be
seventy
years
old
according
to
your
statement
your
vitality
clearly
shows
that
you
are
still
twentyfour
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
tore
up
the
calendar
and
said
beating
the
floor
with
his
foot
your
almanac
is
a
humbug
m
renault
ran
to
his
library
took
up
half
a
dozen
books
at
haphazard
and
made
him
read
at
the
foot
of
the
title
pages
the
dates
pardon
me
said
fougas
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
what
has
happened
to
me
is
so
new
i
do
not
think
that
another
human
being
was
ever
subjected
to
such
a
trial
i
am
seventy
years
old
good
madame
renault
went
and
got
a
lookingglass
from
the
bath
room
and
gave
it
to
him
saying
look
he
took
the
glass
in
both
hands
and
was
silently
occupied
in
resuming
acquaintance
with
himself
when
a
handorgan
came
into
the
court
and
began
playing
partant
pour
la
syrie
fougas
threw
the
mirror
to
the
ground
and
cried
out
what
is
that
you
were
telling
me
i
hear
the
little
song
of
queen
hortense
m
renault
patiently
explained
to
him
while
picking
up
the
pieces
of
the
mirror
that
the
pretty
little
song
of
queen
hortense
had
become
a
national
air
and
even
an
official
one
since
the
regimental
bands
had
substituted
that
gentle
melody
for
the
fierce
marsellaise
and
that
our
soldiers
strange
to
say
had
not
fought
any
the
worse
for
it
but
the
colonel
had
already
opened
the
window
and
was
crying
out
to
the
savoyard
eh
friend
a
napoleon
for
you
if
you
will
tell
me
in
what
year
i
am
drawing
the
breath
of
life
the
artist
began
dancing
as
lightly
as
possible
playing
on
his
musical
instrument
advance
at
the
order
cried
the
colonel
and
keep
that
devilish
machine
still
a
little
penny
my
good
monsieur
it
is
not
a
penny
that
ill
give
you
but
a
napoleon
if
youll
tell
me
what
year
it
is
oh
but
thats
funny
hihihi
and
if
you
dont
tell
me
quicker
than
this
amounts
to
ill
cut
your
ears
off
the
savoyard
ran
away
but
he
came
back
pretty
soon
having
meditated
during
his
flight
on
the
maxim
nothing
risk
nothing
gain
monsieur
said
he
in
a
wheedling
voice
this
is
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
fiftynine
good
cried
fougas
he
felt
in
his
pockets
for
money
and
found
nothing
there
leon
saw
his
predicament
and
flung
twenty
francs
into
the
court
before
shutting
the
window
he
pointed
out
to
the
right
the
façade
of
a
pretty
little
new
building
where
the
colonel
could
distinctly
read
audret
architecte
mdccclix
a
perfectly
satisfactory
piece
of
evidence
and
one
which
did
not
cost
twenty
francs
fougas
a
little
confused
pressed
leons
hand
and
said
to
him
my
friend
i
do
not
forget
that
confidence
is
the
first
duty
from
gratitude
toward
beneficence
but
tell
me
of
our
country
i
tread
the
sacred
soil
where
i
received
my
being
and
i
am
ignorant
of
the
career
of
my
native
land
france
is
still
the
queen
of
the
world
is
she
not
certainly
said
leon
how
is
the
emperor
well
and
the
empress
very
well
and
the
king
of
rome
the
prince
imperial
he
is
a
very
fine
child
how
a
fine
child
and
you
have
the
face
to
say
that
this
is
m
nibor
took
up
the
conversation
and
explained
in
a
few
words
that
the
reigning
sovereign
of
france
was
not
napoleon
i
but
napoleon
iii
but
then
cried
fougas
my
emperor
is
dead
yes
impossible
tell
me
anything
you
will
but
that
my
emperor
is
immortal
m
nibor
and
the
renaults
who
were
not
quite
professional
historians
were
obliged
to
give
him
a
summary
of
the
history
of
our
century
some
one
went
after
a
big
book
written
by
m
de
norvins
and
illustrated
with
fine
engravings
by
raffet
he
only
believed
in
the
presence
of
truth
when
he
could
touch
her
with
his
hand
and
still
cried
out
almost
every
moment
thats
impossible
this
is
not
history
that
you
are
reading
to
me
it
is
a
romance
written
to
make
soldiers
weep
this
young
man
must
indeed
have
had
a
strong
and
welltempered
soul
for
he
learned
in
forty
minutes
all
the
woful
events
which
fortune
had
scattered
through
eighteen
years
from
the
first
abdication
up
to
the
death
of
the
king
of
rome
less
happy
than
his
old
companions
in
arms
he
had
no
interval
of
repose
between
these
terrible
and
repeated
shocks
all
beating
upon
his
heart
at
the
same
time
one
could
have
feared
that
the
blow
might
prove
mortal
and
poor
fougas
die
in
the
first
hour
of
his
recovered
life
but
the
imp
of
a
fellow
yielded
and
recovered
himself
in
quick
succession
like
a
spring
he
cried
out
with
admiration
on
hearing
of
the
five
battles
of
the
campaign
in
france
he
reddened
with
grief
at
the
farewells
of
fontainebleau
the
return
from
the
isle
of
elba
transfigured
his
handsome
and
noble
countenance
at
waterloo
his
heart
rushed
in
with
the
last
army
of
the
empire
and
there
shattered
itself
then
he
clenched
his
fists
and
said
between
his
teeth
if
i
had
been
there
at
the
head
of
the
d
blucher
and
wellington
would
have
seen
another
fate
the
invasion
the
truce
the
martyr
of
st
helena
the
ghastly
terror
of
europe
the
murder
of
muratthe
idol
of
the
cavalry
the
death
of
ney
bruno
mouton
duvernet
and
so
many
other
wholesouled
men
whom
he
had
known
admired
and
loved
threw
him
into
a
series
of
paroxysms
of
rage
but
nothing
upset
him
in
hearing
of
the
death
of
napoleon
he
swore
that
he
would
eat
the
heart
of
england
the
slow
agony
of
the
pale
and
interesting
heir
of
the
empire
inspired
him
with
a
passion
to
tear
the
vitals
out
of
austria
when
the
drama
was
over
and
the
curtain
fell
on
schoenbrunn
he
dashed
away
his
tears
and
said
it
is
well
i
have
lived
in
a
moment
a
mans
entire
life
now
show
me
the
map
of
france
leon
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
of
an
atlas
while
m

attempted
to
continue
narrating
to
the
colonel
the
history
of
the
restoration
and
of
the
monarchy

was

said
he
if

ive
seen
enough
of
them
in
the
dirt
if
the
empire
had
lasted
ten
years
longer
i
could
have
had
a
king
for
a
bootblack
when
the
atlas
was
placed
before
him
he
at
once
cried
out
with
profound
disdain
that
france
but
soon
two
tears
of
pitying
affection
escaping
from
his
eyes
swelled
the
rivers
ardeche
and
gironde
he
kissed
the
map
and
said
with
an
emotion
which
communicated
itself
to
nearly
all
present
forgive
me

old
love
for

said
he
setting
down
a
pile
of
empty
plates
this
is
what
one
might
call
a
ghost
coming
out
of
its
box
to
upset
the
commissary
and
the
subprefect
ghost
if
youll
have
it
so
célestin
its
certainsure
that
he
comes
from
a
good
ways
poor
young
man
but
perhaps
ghost
isnt
a
proper
word
to
use
in
speaking
of
our
masters
is
it
true
then
that
he
has
come
to
be
our
master
too
too
many
of
them
come
every
day
id
like
it
better
if
more
servants
and
help
would
come
shut
up
you
lizard
of
laziness
when
the
gentlemen
leaves
tips
for
us
on
going
away
you
dont
complain
because
theres
only
two
to
divide
em
thats
all
well
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
ive
carried
more
than
fifty
buckets
of
water
for
him
to
simmer
in
that
colonel
of
yours
and
i
know
mighty
well
that
he
wont
give
me
a
cent
for
he
hasnt
a
farthing
in
his
pockets
weve
got
to
believe
that
money
isnt
plenty
in
the
country
he
just
came
from
they
say
theres
wills
in
his
favor
in
strasburg
a
gentleman
whod
hurt
his
fortune
tell
me
now
mamselle
gothonyou
who
read
a
little
book
every
sundaywhere
he
could
have
been
our
colonel
while
he
was
not
in
this
world
eh
in
purgatory
of
course
then
why
dont
you
ask
him
about
that
famous
baptiste
your
sweetheart
in
who
let
himself
tumble
off
a
roof
and
on
whose
account
you
have
so
many
masses
said
they
ought
to
have
met
each
other
down
there
thats
very
possible
unless
baptiste
has
left
there
since
the
time
when
you
paid
so
much
money
to
get
him
out
very
well
ill
go
this
very
evening
to
the
colonels
chamber
and
since
hes
not
proud
hell
tell
me
all
he
knows
about
itbut
célestin
arent
you
never
going
to
act
different
here
youve
rubbed
my
silver
pickle
knives
on
the
grindstone
again
the
guests
came
into
the
parlor
where
the
renault
family
with
m
nibor
and
the
colonel
were
already
assembled
there
were
successively
presented
to
m
fougas
the
mayor
of
the
city
doctor
martout
master
bonnivet
the
notary
m
audret
and
three
members
of
the
paris
committee
the
other
three
had
been
obliged
to
return
before
dinner
the
guests
were
not
entirely
at
their
ease
their
sides
bruised
by
the
first
movements
of
fougas
left
room
for
them
to
suppose
that
possibly
they
were
dining
with
a
maniac
but
curiosity
was
stronger
than
fear
the
colonel
soon
reassured
them
by
a
most
cordial
reception
he
excused
himself
for
acting
the
part
of
a
man
just
returned
from
the
other
world
he
talked
a
great
deala
little
too
much
perhaps
but
they
were
so
well
pleased
to
listen
to
him
and
his
words
borrowed
such
an
importance
from
the
singularity
of
recent
events
that
he
gained
an
unqualified
success
he
was
told
that
dr
martout
had
been
one
of
the
principal
agents
of
his
resuscitation
in
conjunction
with
another
person
whom
they
promised
soon
to
present
to
him
he
thanked
m
martout
warmly
and
asked
how
soon
he
could
evince
his
gratitude
to
the
other
person
i
hope
said
leon
that
you
will
see
her
this
evening
no
one
came
later
than
the
colonel
of
the
d
of
the
line
m
rollon
he
made
his
way
with
no
little
difficulty
through
the
crowds
of
people
who
filled
the
rue
de
la
faisanderie
he
was
a
man
of
fortyfive
with
a
quick
voice
and
full
figure
his
hair
was
a
little
grizzled
but
his
brown
mustache
full
and
twisted
at
the
ends
looked
as
young
as
ever
he
said
little
spoke
to
the
point
knew
a
great
deal
and
did
no
boastingall
in
all
he
was
a
fine
specimen
of
a
colonel
he
came
right
up
to
fougas
and
held
out
his
hand
like
an
old
acquaintance
my
dear
comrade
said
he
i
have
taken
great
interest
in
your
resurrection
as
much
on
my
own
account
as
on
account
of
the
regiment
the
d
which
i
have
the
honor
to
command
yesterday
venerated
you
as
an
ancestor
from
today
it
will
cherish
you
as
a
friendnot
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
affair
of
the
morning
in
which
m
rollon
had
undergone
his
pummelling
with
the
rest
fougas
answered
becomingly
but
with
a
tinge
of
coldness
my
dear
comrade
i
thank
you
for
your
kindly
sentiments
it
is
singular
that
destiny
places
me
in
the
presence
of
my
successor
on
the
very
day
that
i
reopen
my
eyes
to
the
light
for
after
all
i
am
neither
dead
nor
a
general
i
have
not
been
transferred
nor
have
i
been
retired
yet
i
see
another
officer
more
worthy
doubtless
at
the
head
of
my
noble
d
but
if
you
have
for
your
motto
honor
and
courage
as
i
am
well
satisfied
you
have
i
have
no
right
to
complain
and
the
regiment
is
in
good
hands
dinner
was
ready
mme
renault
took
fougas
arm
she
had
him
sit
at
her
right
and
m
nibor
at
her
left
the
colonel
and
the
mayor
took
their
places
at
the
sides
of
m
renault
the
rest
of
the
company
distributed
themselves
as
it
happened
regardless
of
etiquette
fougas
gulped
down
the
soup
and
entrées
helping
himself
to
every
dish
and
drinking
in
proportion
an
appetite
of
the
other
world
estimable
amphitryon
said
he
to
m
renault
dont
get
frightened
at
seeing
me
fall
upon
the
rations
i
always
ate
just
so
except
during
the
retreat
in
russia
consider
too
that
i
went
to
sleep
last
night
at
liebenfeld
without
any
supper
he
begged
m
nibor
to
explain
to
him
by
what
course
of
circumstances
he
had
come
from
liebenfeld
to
fontainebleau
do
you
remember
said
the
doctor
an
old
german
who
acted
as
interpreter
for
you
before
the
courtmartial
perfectly
an
excellent
man
with
a
violetcolored
wig
ill
remember
him
all
my
life
for
there
are
not
two
wigs
of
that
color
in
existence
very
well
it
was
the
man
with
the
violet
wig
otherwise
known
as
the
celebrated
doctor
meiser
who
saved
your
life
where
is
he
i
want
to
see
him
to
fall
into
his
arms
to
tell
him
he
was
sixtyeight
years
old
when
he
did
you
that
little
service
he
would
then
be
today
in
his
hundred
and
fifteenth
year
if
he
had
waited
for
your
acknowledgments
and
so
then
he
is
no
more
death
has
robbed
him
of
my
gratitude
you
do
not
yet
know
all
that
you
owe
to
him
he
bequeathed
you
in
a
fortune
of
seventyfive
thousand
francs
of
which
you
are
the
rightful
owner
now
since
a
sum
invested
at
five
per
cent
doubles
itself
in
fourteen
yearsthanks
to
compound
interestyou
were
worth
in
a
trifle
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
and
in
a
million
and
a
half
in
fine
if
you
are
satisfied
to
leave
your
property
in
the
hands
of
herr
nicholas
meiser
of
dantzic
that
worthy
man
will
owe
you
three
millions
at
the
commencement
of
that
is
to
say
in
seven
years
we
will
give
you
this
evening
a
copy
of
your
benefactors
will
it
is
a
very
instructive
document
and
you
can
consider
it
when
you
go
to
bed
ill
read
it
willingly
said
colonel
fougas
but
gold
has
no
attractions
for
my
eyes
wealth
engenders
weakness
me
to
languish
in
the
sluggish
idleness
of
sybaristo
enervate
my
senses
on
a
bed
of
roses
never
the
smell
of
powder
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
perfumes
of
arabia
life
would
have
no
charm
or
zest
for
me
if
i
had
to
give
up
the
inspiriting
clash
of
arms
on
the
day
when
you
are
told
that
fougas
no
longer
marches
in
the
columns
of
the
army
you
can
safely
answer
it
is
because
fougas
is
no
more
he
turned
to
the
new
colonel
of
the
d
and
said
oh
do
you
my
dear
comrade
tell
them
that
the
proud
pomp
of
wealth
is
a
thousand
times
less
sweet
than
the
austere
simplicity
of
the
soldierof
a
colonel
more
than
all
colonels
are
the
kings
of
the
army
a
colonel
is
less
than
a
general
but
nevertheless
he
has
something
more
he
lives
more
with
the
soldier
he
penetrates
further
into
the
intimacy
of
his
command
he
is
the
father
the
judge
the
friend
of
his
regiment
the
welfare
of
each
one
of
his
men
is
in
his
hands
the
flag
is
placed
under
his
tent
or
in
his
chamber
the
colonel
and
the
flag
are
not
two
separate
existences
one
is
the
soul
the
other
is
the
body
he
asked
m
rollons
permission
to
go
to
see
and
embrace
the
flag
of
the
d
you
shall
see
it
tomorrow
morning
said
the
new
colonel
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
breakfast
with
me
in
company
with
some
of
my
officers
he
accepted
the
invitation
with
enthusiasm
and
flung
himself
into
the
midst
of
a
thousand
questions
touching
pay
the
amount
retained
for
clothing
promotion
roster
reserve
uniform
full
and
fatigue
dress
armament
and
tactics
he
understood
without
difficulty
the
advantages
of
the
percussion
gun
but
the
attempt
to
explain
rifled
cannon
to
him
was
in
vain
artillery
was
not
his
forte
but
he
avowed
nevertheless
that
napoleon
had
owed
more
than
one
victory
to
his
fine
artillery
while
the
innumerable
roasts
of
mme
renault
were
succeeding
each
other
on
the
table
fougas
askedbut
without
ever
losing
a
bitewhat
were
the
principal
wars
in
progress
how
many
nations
france
had
on
her
hands
and
if
it
was
not
intended
ultimately
to
recommence
the
conquest
of
the
world
the
answers
which
he
received
without
completely
satisfying
him
did
not
entirely
deprive
him
of
hope
i
did
well
to
come
said
he
theres
work
to
do
the
african
wars
did
not
interest
him
much
although
in
them
the
d
had
won
a
good
share
of
glory
as
a
school
its
very
well
said
he
the
soldier
ought
to
train
himself
in
other
ways
than
in
the
tivoli
gardens
behind
nurses
petticoats
but
why
the
devil
are
not
five
hundred
thousand
men
flung
upon
the
back
of
england
england
is
the
soul
of
the
coalition
i
can
tell
you
that
how
many
explanations
were
necessary
to
make
him
understand
the
crimean
war
where
the
english
had
fought
by
our
sides
i
can
understand
said
he
why
we
took
a
crack
at
the
russiansthey
made
me
eat
my
best
horse
but
the
english
are
a
thousand
times
worse
if
this
young
man
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
doesnt
know
it
ill
tell
him
there
is
no
quarter
possible
after
what
they
did
at
st
helena
if
i
had
been
commanderinchief
in
the
crimea
i
would
have
begun
by
properly
squelching
the
russians
after
which
i
would
have
turned
upon
the
english
and
hurled
them
into
the
sea
its
their
element
anyhow
they
gave
him
some
details
of
the
italian
campaign
and
he
was
charmed
to
learn
that
the
d
had
taken
a
redoubt
under
the
eyes
of
the
marshal
the
duke
of
solferino
thats
the
habit
of
the
regiment
said
he
shedding
tears
in
his
napkin
that
brigand
of
a
d
will
never
act
in
any
other
way
the
goddess
of
victory
has
touched
it
with
her
wing
one
of
the
things
for
example
which
greatly
astonished
him
was
that
a
war
of
such
importance
was
finished
up
in
so
short
a
time
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
within
a
few
years
the
world
had
learned
the
secret
of
transporting
a
hundred
thousand
men
in
four
days
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
good
said
he
i
admit
the
practicability
of
it
but
what
astonishes
me
is
that
the
emperor
did
not
invent
this
affair
in
for
he
had
a
genius
for
transportation
a
genius
for
administration
a
genius
for
office
details
a
genius
for
everything
but
to
resume
your
story
the
austrians
are
fortified
at
last
and
you
cannot
possibly
get
to
vienna
in
less
than
three
months
we
did
not
go
so
far
in
fact
you
did
not
push
on
to
vienna
no
well
then
where
did
you
sign
the
treaty
of
peace
at
villafranca
at
villafranca
thats
the
capital
of
austria
then
no
its
a
village
of
italy
monsieur
i
dont
admit
that
treaties
of
peace
are
signed
anywhere
but
in
capitals
that
was
our
principle
our
a
b
c
the
first
paragraph
of
our
theory
it
seems
as
if
the
world
must
have
changed
a
good
deal
while
i
was
not
in
it
but
patience
and
now
truth
obliges
me
to
confess
that
fougas
got
drunk
at
dessert
he
had
drunk
and
eaten
like
a
homeric
hero
and
talked
more
fluently
than
cicero
in
his
best
days
the
fumes
of
wine
spices
and
eloquence
mounted
into
his
brain
he
became
familiar
spoke
affectionately
to
some
and
rudely
to
others
and
poured
out
a
torrent
of
absurdities
big
enough
to
turn
forty
mills
his
drunkenness
however
had
in
it
nothing
brutal
or
even
ignoble
it
was
but
the
overflowing
of
a
spirit
young
affectionate
vainglorious
and
unbalanced
he
proposed
five
or
six
toaststo
glory
to
the
extension
of
our
frontiers
to
the
destruction
of
the
last
of
the
english
to
mlle
marsthe
hope
of
the
french
stage
to
affectionthe
tie
fragile
but
dear
which
unites
the
lover
to
his
sweetheart
the
father
to
his
son
the
colonel
to
his
regiment
his
style
a
singular
mixture
of
familiarity
and
impressiveness
provoked
more
than
one
smile
among
the
auditory
he
noticed
it
and
a
spark
of
defiance
flashed
up
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
from
time
to
time
he
loudly
asked
if
those
people
there
were
not
abusing
his
ingenuousness
confusion
cried
he
confusion
to
those
who
want
me
to
take
bladders
for
lanterns
the
lantern
may
blaze
out
like
a
bomb
and
carry
consternation
in
its
path
after
a
series
of
such
remarks
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
roll
under
the
table
and
this
dénoûement
was
generally
expected
but
the
colonel
belonged
to
a
robust
generation
accustomed
to
more
than
one
kind
of
excess
and
strong
to
resist
pleasure
as
well
as
dangers
privations
and
fatigues
so
when
madame
renault
pushed
back
her
chair
in
indication
that
the
repast
was
finished
fougas
arose
without
difficulty
gracefully
offered
his
arm
and
conducted
his
partner
to
the
parlor
his
gait
was
a
little
stiff
and
oppressively
regular
but
he
went
straight
ahead
and
did
not
oscillate
the
least
bit
he
took
a
couple
of
cups
of
coffee
and
spirits
in
moderation
after
which
he
began
to
talk
in
the
most
reasonable
manner
in
the
world
about
ten
oclock
m
martout
having
expressed
a
wish
to
hear
his
history
he
placed
himself
on
a
stool
collected
his
ideas
for
a
moment
and
asked
for
a
glass
of
water
and
sugar
the
company
seated
themselves
in
a
circle
around
him
and
he
commenced
the
following
narrative
the
slightly
antiquated
style
of
which
craves
your
indulgence
chapter
xiii
history
of
colonel
fougas
related
by
himself
do
not
expect
that
i
will
ornament
my
story
with
those
flowers
more
agreeable
than
substantial
which
imagination
often
uses
to
gloss
over
truth
a
frenchman
and
a
soldier
i
doubly
ignore
deception
friendship
interrogates
me
frankness
shall
answer
i
was
born
of
poor
but
honest
parents
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
which
the
jeu
de
paume
brightened
with
an
aurora
of
liberty
the
south
was
my
native
clime
the
language
dear
to
the
troubadours
was
that
which
i
lisped
in
my
cradle
my
birth
cost
my
mothers
life
the
author
of
mine
was
the
humble
owner
of
a
little
farm
and
moistened
his
bread
in
the
sweat
of
labor
my
first
sports
were
not
those
of
wealth
the
manycolored
pebbles
which
are
found
by
the
brooks
and
that
wellknown
insect
which
childhood
holds
fluttering
free
and
captive
at
the
same
time
at
the
end
of
a
thread
stood
me
in
stead
of
other
playthings
an
old
minister
at
devotions
altar
enfranchised
from
the
shadowy
bondage
of
fanaticism
and
reconciled
to
the
new
institutions
of
france
was
my
chiron
and
mentor
he
nourished
me
with
the
strong
lions
marrow
of
rome
and
athens
his
lips
distilled
into
my
ears
the
embalmed
honey
of
wisdom
honor
to
thee
learned
and
venerable
man
who
gavest
me
the
first
precepts
of
wisdom
and
the
first
examples
of
virtue
but
already
that
atmosphere
of
glory
which
the
genius
of
one
man
and
the
valor
of
a
nation
had
set
floating
over
the
country
filled
all
my
senses
and
made
my
young
heart
throb
france
on
the
edge
of
the
volcano
of
civil
war
had
collected
all
her
forces
into
a
thunderbolt
to
launch
upon
europe
and
the
world
astounded
if
not
overwhelmed
was
shrinking
from
the
surge
of
the
unchained
torrent
what
man
what
frenchman
could
have
heard
with
indifference
that
echo
of
victory
reverberating
through
millions
of
hearts
while
scarcely
leaving
childhood
i
felt
that
honor
is
more
precious
than
life
the
warlike
music
of
the
drums
brought
to
my
eyes
brave
and
manly
tears
and
i
too
said
i
following
the
music
of
the
regiments
through
the
streets
of
toulouse
will
pluck
laurels
though
i
sprinkle
them
with
my
blood
the
pale
olive
of
peace
had
from
me
nothing
but
scorn
the
peaceful
triumphs
of
the
law
the
calm
pleasures
of
commerce
and
finance
were
extolled
in
vain
to
the
toga
of
our
ciceros
to
the
robe
of
our
magistrates
to
the
curule
chair
of
our
legislators
to
the
opulence
of
our
mondors
i
preferred
the
sword
one
would
have
said
that
i
had
sucked
the
milk
of
bellona
victory
or
death
was
already
my
motto
and
i
was
not
sixteen
years
old
with
what
noble
scorn
i
heard
recounted
the
history
of
our
proteuses
of
politics
with
what
disdainful
glances
i
regarded
the
turcarets
of
finance
lolling
on
the
cushions
of
some
magnificent
carriage
and
conducted
by
a
laced
automaton
to
the
boudoir
of
some
aspasia
but
if
i
heard
told
the
mighty
deeds
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
or
the
valor
of
the
crusaders
celebrated
in
flowing
verse
if
chance
placed
in
my
hand
the
great
actions
of
our
modern
rolands
recounted
in
an
army
bulletin
by
the
successor
of
charlemagne
a
flame
presaging
the
fire
of
battles
rose
in
my
young
eyes
ah
the
inaction
was
too
much
and
my
leadingstrings
already
worn
by
impatience
would
have
broken
perhaps
had
not
a
fathers
wisdom
untied
them
most
surely
said
he
to
me
trying
but
in
vain
to
restrain
his
tears
it
was
no
tyrant
who
begot
you
and
i
will
not
poison
the
life
which
i
myself
gave
you
i
had
hoped
that
your
hand
would
remain
in
our
cottage
to
close
my
eyes
but
when
patriotism
has
spoken
egotism
must
be
still
my
prayers
will
always
follow
you
to
the
field
where
mars
harvests
heroes
may
you
merit
the
guerdon
of
valor
and
show
yourself
a
good
citizen
as
you
have
been
a
good
son
speaking
thus
he
opened
his
arms
to
me
i
threw
myself
into
them
we
mingled
our
tears
and
i
promised
to
return
to
our
hearthstone
as
soon
as
i
could
bring
the
star
of
honor
suspended
from
my
breast
but
alas
my
unhappy
father
was
destined
to
see
me
no
more
the
fate
which
was
already
gilding
the
thread
of
my
days
pitilessly
severed
that
of
his
a
strangers
hand
closed
his
eyes
while
i
was
gaining
my
first
epaulette
at
the
battle
of
jena
lieutenant
at
eylau
captain
at
wagram
and
there
decorated
by
the
emperors
own
hand
on
the
field
of
battle
major
before
almieda
lieutenantcolonel
at
badajoz
colonel
at
moscow
i
have
drunk
the
cup
of
victory
to
the
full
but
i
have
also
tasted
the
chalice
of
adversity
the
frozen
plains
of
russia
saw
me
alone
with
a
platoon
of
braves
the
last
remnant
of
my
regiment
forced
to
devour
the
mortal
remains
of
that
faithful
friend
who
had
so
often
carried
me
into
the
very
heart
of
the
enemys
battalions
trusty
and
affectionate
companion
of
my
dangers
when
rendered
useless
by
an
accident
at
smolensk
he
devoted
his
very
manes
to
the
safety
of
his
master
and
made
of
his
skin
a
protection
for
my
frozen
and
lacerated
feet
my
tongue
refuses
to
repeat
the
story
of
our
perils
in
that
terrible
campaign
perhaps
some
day
i
will
write
it
with
a
pen
dipped
in
tearstears
the
tribute
of
feeble
humanity
surprised
by
the
season
of
frosts
in
a
zone
of
ice
without
fire
without
bread
without
shoes
without
means
of
transportation
denied
the
succor
of
esculapius
art
harassed
by
the
cossacks
robbed
by
the
peasantspositive
vampires
we
saw
our
mute
thunderers
which
had
fallen
into
the
enemys
hands
belch
forth
death
upon
ourselves
what
more
can
i
tell
you
the
passage
of
the
beresina
the
opposition
at
wilnaoh
ye
gods
of
thunder
but
i
feel
that
grief
overcomes
me
and
that
my
language
is
becoming
tinged
with
the
bitterness
of
these
recollections
nature
and
love
were
holding
in
reserve
for
me
brief
but
precious
consolations
released
from
my
fatigues
i
passed
a
few
happy
days
in
my
native
land
among
the
peaceful
vales
of
nancy
while
our
phalanxes
were
preparing
themselves
for
fresh
combats
while
i
was
gathering
around
my
flag
three
thousand
young
but
valorous
warriors
all
resolved
to
open
to
posterity
the
path
of
honor
a
new
emotion
to
which
i
had
before
been
a
stranger
furtively
glided
into
my
soul
beautified
by
all
natures
gifts
enriched
by
the
fruits
of
an
excellent
education
the
young
and
interesting
clementine
had
scarcely
passed
from
the
uncertain
shadows
of
childhood
into
the
sweet
illusions
of
youth
eighteen
springs
composed
her
life
her
parents
extended
to
some
of
the
army
officers
a
hospitality
which
though
it
was
not
gratuitous
was
far
from
lacking
in
cordiality
to
see
their
child
and
love
her
was
for
me
the
affair
of
a
day
her
virgin
heart
smiled
upon
my
love
at
the
first
avowals
dictated
to
me
by
my
passion
i
saw
her
forehead
color
with
a
lovely
modesty
we
exchanged
our
vows
one
lovely
evening
in
june
under
an
arbor
where
her
happy
father
sometimes
dispensed
to
the
thirsty
officers
the
brown
liquor
of
the
north
i
swore
that
she
should
be
my
wife
and
she
promised
to
be
mine
she
yielded
still
more
our
happiness
regardless
of
all
outside
had
the
calmness
of
a
brook
whose
pure
wave
is
never
troubled
by
the
storm
and
which
rolls
sweetly
between
flowery
banks
spreading
its
own
freshness
through
the
grove
that
protects
its
modest
course
a
lightning
stroke
separated
us
from
each
other
at
the
moment
when
law
and
religion
were
about
adding
their
sanction
to
our
sweet
communion
i
departed
before
i
was
able
to
give
my
name
to
her
who
had
given
me
her
heart
i
promised
to
return
she
promised
to
wait
for
me
and
all
bathed
in
her
tears
i
tore
myself
from
her
arms
to
rush
to
the
laurels
of
dresden
and
the
cypresses
of
leipzic
a
few
lines
from
her
hand
reached
me
during
the
interval
between
the
two
battles
you
are
to
be
a
father
she
told
me
am
i
one
god
knows
has
she
waited
for
me
i
believe
she
has
the
waiting
must
have
appeared
to
be
a
long
one
since
the
birth
of
this
child
who
is
fortysix
years
old
today
and
who
could
be
in
his
turn
my
father
pardon
me
for
having
troubled
you
so
long
with
misfortunes
i
wished
to
pass
rapidly
over
this
sad
history
but
the
unhappiness
of
virtue
has
in
it
something
sweet
to
temper
the
bitterness
of
grief
some
days
after
the
disaster
of
leipzic
the
giant
of
our
age
had
me
called
into
his
tent
and
said
to
me
colonel
are
you
a
man
to
make
your
way
through
four
armies
yes
sire
alone
and
without
escort
yes
sire
there
must
be
a
letter
carried
to
dantzic
yes
sire
you
will
deliver
it
into
general
rapps
own
hands
yes
sire
it
is
probable
you
will
be
taken
or
killed
yes
sire
for
that
reason
i
send
two
other
officers
with
copies
of
the
same
despatch
there
are
three
of
you
the
enemy
will
kill
two
the
third
will
get
there
and
france
will
be
saved
yes
sire
the
one
who
returns
shall
be
a
brigadiergeneral
yes
sire
every
detail
of
this
interview
every
word
of
the
emperor
every
response
which
i
had
the
honor
to
address
to
him
is
still
engraved
upon
my
memory
all
three
of
us
set
out
separately
alas
not
one
of
us
reached
the
goal
aimed
at
by
his
valor
and
i
have
learned
today
that
france
was
not
saved
but
when
i
see
these
blockheads
of
historians
asserting
that
the
emperor
forgot
to
send
orders
to
general
rapp
i
feel
a
terrible
itching
to
cut
their
story
short
at
least
when
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
russians
in
a
german
village
i
had
the
consolation
of
finding
an
old
philosopher
who
gave
me
the
rarest
proofs
of
friendship
who
would
have
told
me
when
i
succumbed
to
the
numbness
of
the
cold
in
the
tower
of
liebenfeld
that
that
sleep
would
not
be
the
last
god
is
my
witness
that
in
then
addressing
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
a
last
farewell
to
clementine
i
did
not
even
hope
to
see
her
again
i
will
see
you
again
then
o
sweet
and
confiding
clementinebest
of
spouses
and
probably
of
mothers
what
do
i
say
i
see
her
now
my
eyes
do
not
deceive
me
this
is
surely
she
there
she
is
just
as
i
left
her
clementine
in
my
arms
on
my
heart
look
here
whats
this
youve
been
whining
to
me
the
rest
of
you
napoleon
is
not
dead
and
the
world
has
not
grown
fortysix
years
older
for
clementine
is
still
the
same
the
betrothed
of
leon
renault
was
about
entering
the
room
and
stopped
petrified
at
finding
herself
so
overwhelmingly
received
by
the
colonel
chapter
xiv
the
game
of
love
and
war
as
she
was
evidently
backward
in
falling
into
his
arms
fougas
imitated
mahomet
and
ran
to
the
mountain
oh
clementine
said
he
covering
her
with
kisses
the
friendly
fates
give
you
back
to
my
devotion
i
clasp
once
more
the
partner
of
my
life
and
the
mother
of
my
child
the
young
lady
was
so
astounded
that
she
did
not
even
dream
of
defending
herself
happily
leon
renault
extricated
her
from
the
hands
of
the
colonel
and
placed
himself
between
them
determined
to
defend
his
own
monsieur
cried
he
clenching
his
fists
you
deceive
yourself
entirely
if
you
think
you
know
mademoiselle
she
is
not
a
person
of
your
time
but
of
ours
she
is
not
your
fiancée
but
mine
she
has
never
been
the
mother
of
your
child
and
i
trust
that
she
will
be
the
mother
of
mine
fougas
was
iron
he
seized
his
rival
by
the
arm
sent
him
off
spinning
like
a
top
and
put
himself
face
to
face
with
the
young
girl
are
you
clementine
he
demanded
of
her
yes
monsieur
i
call
you
all
to
witness
that
she
is
my
clementine
leon
returned
to
the
charge
and
seized
the
colonel
by
the
collar
at
the
risk
of
getting
himself
dashed
against
the
walls
weve
had
joking
enough
said
he
possibly
you
dont
pretend
to
monopolize
all
the
clementines
in
the
world
mademoiselles
name
is
clementine
sambucco
she
was
born
at
martinique
where
you
never
set
your
foot
if
i
am
to
believe
what
you
have
said
within
an
hour
she
is
eighteen
years
old
so
was
the
other
eh
the
other
is
sixtyfour
today
since
she
was
eighteen
in
mlle
sambucco
is
of
an
honorable
and
wellknown
family
her
father
m
sambucco
was
a
magistrate
her
grandfather
was
a
functionary
of
the
war
department
you
see
she
is
in
no
way
connected
with
you
nearly
or
remotely
and
good
sense
and
politeness
to
say
nothing
of
gratitude
make
it
your
duty
to
leave
her
in
peace
he
gave
the
colonel
a
shove
in
his
turn
and
made
him
tumble
between
the
arms
of
a
sofa
fougas
bounded
up
as
if
he
had
been
thrown
on
a
million
springs
but
clementine
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
and
a
smile
monsieur
said
she
in
her
most
caressing
voice
do
not
get
angry
with
him
he
loves
me
so
much
the
more
reason
why
i
should
damnation
he
cooled
down
nevertheless
made
the
young
lady
sit
down
beside
him
and
regarded
her
from
head
to
foot
with
the
most
absorbed
attention
this
is
surely
she
said
he
my
memory
my
eyes
my
heart
everything
in
me
recognizes
her
and
tells
me
that
it
is
she
and
nevertheless
the
testimony
of
mankind
the
calculation
of
times
and
distances
in
a
word
the
very
soul
of
evidence
seems
to
have
made
it
a
special
point
to
convict
me
of
error
is
it
possible
then
that
two
women
should
so
resemble
each
other
am
i
the
victim
of
an
illusion
of
the
senses
have
i
recovered
life
only
to
lose
reason
no
i
know
myself
i
find
myself
the
same
my
judgment
is
firm
and
accurate
and
can
make
its
way
in
this
world
so
new
and
topsyturvy
it
is
on
but
one
point
that
my
reason
waversclementinei
seem
to
see
you
again
and
you
are
not
you
well
whats
the
difference
after
all
if
the
destiny
which
snatched
me
from
the
tomb
has
taken
care
to
present
to
my
awaking
sense
the
image
of
her
i
loved
it
must
be
because
it
had
resolved
to
give
me
back
one
after
another
all
the
blessings
which
i
had
lost
in
a
few
days
my
epaulettes
tomorrow
the
flag
of
the
d
of
the
line
today
this
adorable
presence
which
made
my
heart
beat
for
the
first
time
living
image
of
all
that
is
sweetest
and
clearest
in
the
past
i
throw
myself
at
your
feet
be
my
wife
the
devil
of
a
fellow
joined
the
deed
to
the
word
and
the
witnesses
of
the
unexpected
scene
opened
their
eyes
to
the
widest
but
clementines
aunt
the
austere
mlle
sambucco
thought
that
it
was
time
to
show
her
authority
she
stretched
out
her
big
wrinkled
hands
seized
fougas
jerked
him
sharply
to
his
feet
and
cried
in
her
shrillest
voice
enough
sir
it
is
time
to
put
an
end
to
this
scandalous
farce
my
niece
is
not
for
you
i
have
promised
her
and
given
her
away
know
that
day
after
tomorrow
the
th
of
this
month
at
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
she
will
marry
m
leon
renault
your
benefactor
and
i
forbid
itdo
you
hear
madame
aunt
and
if
she
pretends
to
marry
this
boy
what
will
you
do
ill
curse
her
leon
could
not
help
laughing
the
malediction
of
this
twentyfiveyearold
colonel
appeared
rather
more
comic
than
terrible
but
clementine
grew
pale
burst
into
tears
and
fell
in
her
turn
at
the
feet
of
fougas
monsieur
cried
she
kissing
his
hands
do
not
overwhelm
a
poor
girl
who
venerates
you
who
loves
you
who
will
sacrifice
her
happiness
if
you
demand
it
by
all
the
marks
of
tenderness
which
i
have
lavished
upon
you
for
a
month
by
the
tears
i
have
poured
upon
your
coffin
by
the
respectful
zeal
with
which
i
have
urged
on
your
resuscitation
i
conjure
you
to
pardon
our
offences
i
will
not
marry
leon
if
you
forbid
me
i
will
do
anything
to
please
you
i
will
obey
you
in
everything
but
for
gods
sake
do
not
pour
upon
me
your
maledictions
embrace
me
said
fougas
you
yield
i
pardon
clementine
raised
herself
all
radiant
with
joy
and
held
up
her
beautiful
forehead
the
stupefaction
of
the
spectators
especially
of
those
most
interested
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
an
old
mummy
dictating
laws
breaking
off
marriages
and
imposing
his
desires
on
the
whole
house
pretty
little
clementine
so
reasonable
so
obedient
so
happy
in
the
prospect
of
marrying
leon
renault
sacrificing
all
at
once
her
affections
her
happiness
and
almost
her
duty
to
the
caprice
of
an
interloper
m
nibor
declared
that
it
was
madness
as
for
leon
he
would
have
butted
his
head
into
all
the
walls
if
his
mother
had
not
held
him
back
ah
my
poor
child
said
she
why
did
you
bring
that
thing
from
berlin
its
my
fault
cried
old
monsieur
renault
no
interrupted
dr
martout
its
mine
the
members
of
the
parisian
committee
discussed
with
m
rollon
the
new
aspect
of
the
case
had
they
resuscitated
a
madman
had
the
revivification
produced
some
disorder
of
the
nervous
system
had
the
abuse
of
wine
and
other
drinkables
during
the
first
repast
caused
a
delirium
what
an
interesting
autopsy
it
would
be
if
they
could
dissect
m
fougas
at
the
next
regular
meeting
you
would
do
very
well
as
far
as
you
would
go
gentlemen
said
the
colonel
of
the
d
the
autopsy
might
explain
the
delirium
of
our
unfortunate
friend
but
it
would
not
account
for
the
impression
produced
upon
the
young
lady
is
it
fascination
magnetism
or
what
while
the
friends
and
relations
were
weeping
counselling
and
buzzing
around
him
fougas
serene
and
smiling
gazed
at
himself
in
clementines
eyes
while
they
too
regarded
him
tenderly
this
must
be
brought
to
an
end
cried
mlle
sambucco
the
severe
come
clementine
fougas
seemed
surprised
she
doesnt
live
here
then
no
sir
she
lives
with
me
then
i
will
escort
her
home
angel
will
you
take
my
arm
oh
yes
monsieur
with
great
pleasure
leon
gnashed
his
teeth
this
is
admirable
he
presumes
on
such
familiarity
and
she
takes
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
he
went
to
get
his
hat
for
the
purpose
of
at
least
going
home
with
the
aunt
but
his
hat
was
not
in
its
place
fougas
who
had
not
yet
one
of
his
own
had
helped
himself
to
it
without
ceremony
the
poor
lover
crowded
his
head
into
a
cap
and
followed
fougas
and
clementine
with
the
respectable
virginie
whose
arm
cut
like
a
scythe
by
an
accident
which
happened
almost
daily
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
met
clementine
on
the
way
home
the
young
lady
directed
fougas
attention
to
him
thats
m
du
marnet
said
she
his
restaurant
is
at
the
end
of
our
street
and
his
room
at
the
side
of
the
park
i
think
he
is
very
much
taken
with
my
little
self
but
he
has
never
even
bowed
to
me
the
only
man
for
whom
my
heart
has
ever
beaten
is
leon
renault
ah
indeed
and
me
said
fougas
oh
as
for
you
thats
another
matter
i
respect
you
and
stand
in
awe
of
you
it
seems
to
me
as
if
you
were
a
good
and
respectable
parent
thank
you
im
telling
you
the
truth
as
far
as
i
can
read
it
in
my
heart
all
this
is
not
very
clear
i
confess
but
i
do
not
understand
myself
azure
flower
of
innocence
i
adore
your
sweet
perplexity
let
love
take
care
of
itself
it
will
speak
to
you
in
master
tones
i
dont
know
anything
about
that
its
possible
here
we
are
at
home
good
evening
monsieur
embrace
megood
night
leon
dont
quarrel
with
m
fougas
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
but
i
love
you
in
a
different
way
the
aunt
virginie
made
no
response
to
the
good
evening
of
fougas
when
the
two
men
were
alone
in
the
street
leon
marched
along
without
saying
a
word
till
they
reached
the
next
lamppost
there
planting
himself
resolutely
opposite
the
colonel
he
said
well
sir
now
that
we
are
alone
we
had
better
have
an
explanation
i
dont
know
by
what
philter
or
incantation
you
have
obtained
such
prodigious
influence
over
my
betrothed
but
i
know
that
i
love
her
that
i
have
been
loved
by
her
more
than
four
years
and
that
i
will
not
stop
at
any
means
of
retaining
and
protecting
her
friend
answered
fougas
you
can
brave
me
with
impunity
my
arm
is
chained
by
gratitude
it
shall
never
be
written
in
history
that
pierre
fougas
was
an
ingrate
would
it
have
been
more
ungrateful
in
you
to
cut
my
throat
than
to
rob
me
of
my
wife
oh
my
benefactor
learn
to
understand
and
pardon
god
forbid
that
i
should
marry
clementine
in
spite
of
you
in
spite
of
herself
it
is
through
her
consent
and
your
own
that
i
hope
to
win
her
realize
that
she
has
been
dear
to
me
not
for
four
years
as
to
you
but
for
nearly
half
a
century
reflect
that
i
am
alone
on
earth
and
that
her
sweet
face
is
my
only
consolation
will
you
who
have
given
me
life
prevent
my
spending
it
happily
have
you
called
me
back
to
the
world
only
to
deliver
me
over
to
despairtiger
take
back
then
the
life
you
gave
me
if
you
will
not
permit
me
to
consecrate
it
to
the
adorable
clementine
upon
my
soul
my
dear
fellow
you
are
superb
the
habit
of
victory
must
have
totally
twisted
your
wits
my
hat
is
on
your
headkeep
it
so
far
so
good
but
because
my
betrothed
happens
to
remind
you
vaguely
of
a
girl
in
nancy
must
i
give
her
up
to
you
i
cant
see
it
friend
i
will
give
you
back
your
hat
just
as
soon
as
youve
bought
me
another
one
but
do
not
ask
me
to
give
up
clementine
in
the
first
place
do
you
know
that
she
will
reject
me
im
sure
of
it
she
loves
me
youre
crazy
youve
seen
her
at
my
feet
what
of
that
it
was
from
fear
from
respect
from
superstition
from
anything
in
the
devils
name
you
choose
to
call
it
but
it
was
not
from
love
well
see
about
that
pretty
clearly
after
six
months
of
married
life
but
cried
leon
renault
have
you
the
right
to
dispose
of
yourself
there
is
another
clementine
the
true
one
she
has
sacrificed
everything
for
you
you
are
engaged
in
honor
to
her
is
colonel
fougas
deaf
to
the
voice
of
honor
are
you
mocking
me
what
i
marry
a
woman
sixtyfour
years
old
you
ought
to
if
not
for
her
sake
at
least
for
your
childs
my
child
is
a
pretty
big
boy
hes
fortysix
years
old
he
has
no
further
need
of
my
care
he
does
need
your
name
though
ill
adopt
him
the
law
is
opposed
to
it
youre
not
fifty
years
old
and
hes
not
fifteen
years
younger
than
you
are
quite
the
reverse
very
well
ill
legitimize
him
by
marrying
the
young
clementine
how
can
you
expect
her
to
acknowledge
a
child
twice
as
old
as
she
is
herself
but
then
i
cant
acknowledge
him
any
better
so
theres
no
need
of
my
marrying
the
old
woman
moreover
id
be
excessively
accommodating
to
break
my
head
for
a
child
who
is
very
likely
dead
what
do
i
say
it
is
possible
that
he
never
saw
the
light
i
love
and
am
lovedthat
much
is
substantial
and
certain
and
you
shall
be
my
groomsman
not
yet
awhile
mlle
sambucco
is
a
minor
and
her
guardian
is
my
father
your
father
is
an
honorable
man
and
he
will
not
have
the
baseness
to
refuse
her
to
me
at
least
he
will
ask
you
if
you
have
any
position
any
rank
any
fortune
to
offer
to
his
ward
my
position
colonel
my
rank
colonel
my
fortune
the
pay
of
a
colonel
and
the
millions
at
dantzici
mustnt
forget
themhere
we
are
at
home
let
me
have
the
will
of
that
good
old
gentleman
who
wore
the
lilac
wig
give
me
some
books
on
history
tooa
big
pile
of
themall
that
have
anything
to
say
about
napoleon
young
renault
sadly
obeyed
the
master
he
had
given
himself
he
conducted
fougas
to
a
fine
chamber
brought
him
herr
meisers
will
and
a
whole
shelf
of
books
and
bid
his
mortal
enemy
good
night
the
colonel
embraced
him
impetuously
and
said
to
him
i
will
never
forget
that
to
you
i
owe
life
and
clementine
farewell
till
tomorrow
noble
and
generous
child
of
my
native
land
farewell
leon
went
back
to
the
ground
floor
passed
the
diningroom
where
gothon
was
wiping
the
glasses
and
putting
the
silver
in
order
and
rejoined
his
father
and
mother
who
were
waiting
for
him
in
the
parlor
the
guests
were
gone
the
candles
extinguished
a
single
lamp
lit
up
the
solitude
the
two
mandarins
on
the
étagère
were
motionless
in
their
obscure
corner
and
seemed
to
meditate
gravely
on
the
caprices
of
fortune
well
demanded
mme
renault
i
left
him
in
his
room
crazier
and
more
obstinate
than
ever
however
ive
got
an
idea
so
much
the
better
said
the
father
for
we
have
none
left
sadness
has
made
us
stupid
but
above
all
things
no
quarrelling
these
soldiers
of
the
empire
used
to
be
terrible
swordsmen
oh
im
not
afraid
of
him
its
clementine
that
makes
me
anxious
with
what
sweetness
and
submission
she
listened
to
the
confounded
babbler
the
heart
of
woman
is
an
unfathomable
abyss
well
what
do
you
think
of
doing
leon
developed
in
detail
the
project
he
had
conceived
in
the
street
during
his
conversation
with
fougas
the
most
urgent
thing
said
he
is
to
relieve
clementine
from
this
influence
if
we
could
get
him
out
of
the
way
tomorrow
reason
would
resume
its
empire
and
we
would
be
married
the
day
after
tomorrow
that
being
done
ill
answer
for
the
rest
but
how
is
such
a
madman
to
be
gotten
rid
of
i
see
but
one
way
but
it
is
almost
infallibleto
excite
his
dominant
passion
these
fellows
sometimes
imagine
that
they
are
in
love
but
at
the
bottom
they
love
nothing
but
powder
the
thing
is
to
fling
fougas
back
into
the
current
of
military
ideas
his
breakfast
tomorrow
with
the
colonel
of
the
d
will
be
a
good
preparation
i
made
him
understand
today
that
he
ought
before
all
to
reclaim
his
rank
and
epaulettes
and
he
has
become
inoculated
with
the
idea
hell
go
to
paris
then
possibly
hell
find
there
some
leatherbreeches
of
his
acquaintance
at
all
events
hell
reënter
the
service
the
occupations
incident
to
his
position
will
be
a
powerful
diversion
hell
no
longer
dream
of
clementine
whom
i
will
have
fixed
securely
we
will
have
to
furnish
him
the
wherewithal
to
knock
about
the
world
but
all
sacrifices
of
money
are
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
happiness
i
wish
to
save
madame
renault
who
was
a
woman
of
thrift
blamed
her
sons
generosity
a
little
the
colonel
is
an
ungrateful
soul
said
she
weve
already
done
too
much
in
giving
him
back
his
life
let
him
take
care
of
himself
now
no
said
the
father
weve
not
the
right
to
send
him
forth
entirely
emptyhanded
decency
forbids
this
deliberation
which
had
lasted
a
good
hour
and
a
quarter
was
interrupted
by
a
tremendous
racket
one
would
have
declared
that
the
house
was
falling
down
there
he
is
again
cried
leon
undoubtedly
a
fresh
paroxysm
of
raving
madness
he
ran
followed
by
his
parents
and
mounted
the
steps
four
at
a
time
a
candle
was
burning
at
the
sill
of
the
chamber
door
leon
took
it
and
pushed
the
door
half
open
must
it
be
confessed
hope
and
joy
spoke
louder
to
him
than
fear
he
fancied
himself
already
relieved
of
the
colonel
but
the
spectacle
presented
to
his
eyes
suddenly
diverted
the
course
of
his
ideas
and
the
inconsolable
lover
began
laughing
like
a
fool
a
noise
of
kicks
blows
and
slaps
an
undefined
group
rolling
on
the
floor
in
the
convulsions
of
a
desperate
struggleso
much
was
all
he
could
see
and
understand
at
the
first
glance
soon
fougas
lit
up
by
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
candle
discovered
that
he
was
struggling
with
gothon
like
jacob
with
the
angel
and
went
back
confused
and
pitiable
to
bed
the
colonel
had
gone
to
sleep
over
the
history
of
napoleon
without
putting
out
the
candle
gothon
after
finishing
her
work
saw
the
light
under
the
door
her
thoughts
recurred
to
that
poor
baptiste
who
perhaps
was
groaning
in
purgatory
for
having
let
himself
tumble
from
a
roof
hoping
that
fougas
could
give
her
some
news
of
her
lover
she
rapped
several
times
at
first
softly
then
much
louder
the
colonels
silence
and
the
lighted
candle
made
it
seem
to
the
servant
that
there
was
something
wrong
the
fire
might
catch
the
curtains
and
from
thence
the
whole
building
she
accordingly
set
down
the
candle
opened
the
door
and
went
with
catlike
steps
to
put
out
the
light
possibly
the
eyes
of
the
sleeper
vaguely
perceived
the
passage
of
a
shadow
possibly
gothon
with
her
big
awkward
figure
made
a
board
in
the
floor
creak
fougas
partially
awoke
heard
the
rustling
of
a
dress
dreamed
it
one
of
those
adventures
which
were
wont
to
spice
garrison
life
under
the
first
empire
and
held
out
his
arms
blindly
calling
clementine
gothon
on
finding
herself
seized
by
the
hair
and
shoulders
responded
by
such
a
masculine
blow
that
the
enemy
supposed
himself
attacked
by
a
man
the
blow
was
returned
with
interest
further
exchanges
followed
and
they
finished
by
clinching
and
rolling
on
the
floor
if
anybody
ever
did
feel
shamefaced
fougas
was
certainly
the
man
gothon
went
to
bed
considerably
bruised
the
renault
family
talked
sense
into
the
colonel
and
got
out
of
him
pretty
much
what
they
wanted
he
promised
to
set
out
next
day
accepted
as
a
loan
the
money
offered
him
and
swore
not
to
return
until
he
should
have
recovered
his
epaulettes
and
secured
the
dantzic
bequest
and
then
said
he
ill
marry
clementine
on
that
point
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
him
the
idea
was
fixed
everybody
slept
soundly
in
the
mansion
of
the
renaults
the
heads
of
the
house
because
they
had
had
three
sleepless
nights
fougas
and
gothon
because
each
had
been
unmercifully
pummelled
and
the
young
célestin
because
he
had
drunk
the
heeltaps
from
all
the
glasses
the
next
morning
m
rollon
came
to
know
if
fougas
were
in
a
condition
to
breakfast
with
him
he
feared
just
the
least
bit
that
he
would
find
him
under
a
shower
bath
far
from
it
the
madman
of
yesterday
was
as
calm
as
a
picture
and
as
fresh
as
a
rosebud
he
shaved
with
leons
razors
while
humming
an
air
of
nicolo
with
his
hosts
he
was
charming
and
he
promised
to
settle
a
pension
on
gothon
out
of
herr
meisers
legacy
as
soon
as
he
had
set
off
for
the
breakfast
leon
ran
to
the
dwelling
of
his
sweetheart
everything
is
going
better
said
he
the
colonel
is
much
more
reasonable
he
has
promised
to
leave
for
paris
this
very
day
so
we
can
get
married
tomorrow
mlle
virginie
sambucco
praised
this
plan
of
proceeding
highly
not
only
because
she
had
made
great
preparations
for
the
wedding
but
because
the
postponement
of
the
marriage
would
be
the
talk
of
the
town
the
cards
were
already
out
the
mayor
notified
and
the
virgins
chapel
in
the
parish
church
engaged
to
revoke
all
this
at
the
caprice
of
a
ghost
and
a
fool
would
be
to
sin
against
custom
common
sense
and
heaven
itself
clementine
only
replied
with
tears
she
could
not
be
happy
without
marrying
leon
but
she
would
rather
die
she
said
than
give
her
hand
without
the
sanction
of
m
fougas
she
promised
to
implore
him
on
her
knees
if
necessary
and
wring
from
him
his
consent
but
if
he
refuses
and
its
too
likely
that
he
will
i
will
beseech
him
again
and
again
until
he
says
yes
everybody
conspired
to
convince
her
that
she
was
unreasonableher
aunt
leon
m
and
mme
renault
m
martout
m
bonnivet
and
all
the
friends
of
the
two
families
at
length
she
yielded
but
at
almost
the
same
instant
the
door
flew
open
and
m
audret
rushed
into
the
parlor
crying
out
well
well
here
is
a
piece
of
news
colonel
fougas
is
going
to
fight
m
du
marnet
tomorrow
the
young
girl
fell
thunderstruck
into
the
arms
of
leon
renault
god
punishes
me
cried
she
and
the
chastisement
for
my
impiety
is
not
delayed
will
you
still
force
me
to
obey
you
shall
i
be
dragged
to
the
altar
in
spite
of
myself
at
the
very
hour
hes
risking
his
life
no
one
dared
to
insist
longer
on
seeing
her
in
so
pitiable
a
state
but
leon
offered
up
earnest
prayers
that
victory
might
side
with
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
he
was
wrong
i
confess
but
what
lover
would
have
been
sinless
enough
to
cast
the
first
stone
at
him
and
here
is
an
account
of
how
the
precious
fougas
had
spent
his
day
at
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
the
youngest
two
captains
of
the
d
came
to
conduct
him
in
proper
style
to
the
residence
of
the
colonel
m
rollon
occupied
a
little
palace
of
the
imperial
epoch
a
marble
tablet
inserted
over
the
portecochère
still
bore
the
words
ministère
des
financesa
souvenir
of
the
glorious
time
when
napoleons
court
followed
its
master
to
fontainebleau
colonel
rollon
the
lieutenantcolonel
the
majorinchief
the
three
majors
of
battalions
the
surgeonmajor
and
ten
or
a
dozen
officers
were
outside
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
illustrious
guest
from
the
other
world
the
flag
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
court
under
guard
of
the
ensign
and
a
squad
of
noncommissioned
officers
selected
for
the
honor
the
band
of
the
regiment
at
the
entrance
of
the
garden
filled
up
the
background
of
the
picture
eight
panoplies
of
arms
which
had
been
improvised
the
same
morning
by
the
armorers
of
the
corps
embellished
the
walls
and
railings
a
company
of
grenadiers
with
their
arms
at
rest
were
in
attendance
at
the
entrance
of
fougas
the
band
played
the
famous
partant
pour
la
syrie
the
grenadiers
presented
arms
the
drums
beat
a
salute
the
noncommissioned
officers
and
soldiers
cried
vive
le
colonel
fougas
the
officers
in
a
body
approached
the
patriarch
of
their
regiment
all
this
was
neither
regular
nor
according
to
discipline
but
we
can
well
allow
a
little
latitude
to
these
brave
soldiers
on
finding
their
ancestor
for
them
it
seemed
a
little
debauch
in
glory
the
hero
of
the
fête
grasped
the
hands
of
the
colonel
and
officers
with
as
much
emotion
as
if
he
had
found
his
old
comrades
again
he
cordially
saluted
the
noncommissioned
officers
and
soldiers
approached
the
flag
bent
one
knee
to
the
earth
raised
himself
loftily
grasped
the
staff
turned
toward
the
attentive
crowd
and
said
my
friends
under
the
shadow
of
the
flag
a
soldier
of
france
after
fortysix
years
of
exile
finds
his
family
again
today
all
honor
to
thee
symbol
of
our
fatherland
old
partner
in
our
victories
and
heroic
support
in
our
misfortunes
thy
radiant
eagle
has
hovered
over
prostrate
and
trembling
europe
thy
bruised
eagle
has
again
dashed
obstinately
against
misfortune
and
terrified
the
sons
of
power
honor
to
thee
thou
who
hast
led
us
to
glory
and
fortified
us
against
the
clamor
of
despair
i
have
seen
thee
ever
foremost
in
the
fiercest
dangers
proud
flag
of
my
native
land
men
have
fallen
around
thee
like
grain
before
the
reaper
while
thou
alone
hast
shown
to
the
enemy
thy
front
unbending
and
superb
bullets
and
cannonshot
have
torn
thee
with
wounds
but
never
upon
thee
has
the
audacious
stranger
placed
his
hand
may
the
future
deck
thy
front
with
new
laurels
mayst
thou
conquer
new
and
farextending
realms
which
no
fatality
shall
rob
thee
of
the
day
of
great
deeds

being
born
again
believe
a
warrior
who
has
risen
from
the
tomb
to
tell
thee
so
forward
yes
i
swear
it
by
the
spirit
of
him
who
led
us
at
wagram
there
shall
be
great
days
for
france
when
thou
shalt
shelter
with
thy
glorious
folds
the
fortunes
of
the
brave
d
eloquence
so
martial
and
patriotic
stirred
all
hearts
fougas
was
applauded
fêted
embraced
and
almost
carried
in
triumph
into
the
banquet
hall
seated
at
table
opposite
m
rollon
as
if
he
were
a
second
master
of
the
house
he
breakfasted
heartily
talked
a
great
deal
and
drank
more
yet
you
may
occasionally
meet
in
the
world
people
who
get
drunk
without
drinking
fougas
was
far
from
being
one
of
them
he
never
felt
his
equanimity
seriously
disturbed
short
of
three
bottles
often
in
fact
he
went
much
further
without
yielding
the
toasts
presented
at
dessert
were
distinguished
for
pith
and
cordiality
i
would
like
to
recount
them
in
order
but
am
forced
to
admit
that
they
would
take
up
too
much
room
and
that
the
last
which
were
the
most
touching
were
not
of
a
lucidity
absolutely
voltairian
they
arose
from
the
table
at
two
oclock
and
betook
themselves
in
a
body
to
the
café
militaire
where
the
officers
of
the
d
placed
a
punch
before
the
two
colonels
they
had
invited
with
a
feeling
of
eminent
propriety
the
superior
officers
of
the
regiment
of
cuirassiers
fougas
who
was
drunker
in
his
own
proper
person
than
a
whole
battalion
of
suisses
distributed
a
great
many
handshakings
but
across
the
storm
which
disturbed
his
spirit
he
recognized
the
person
and
name
of
m
du
marnet
and
made
a
grimace
between
officers
and
above
all
between
officers
of
different
arms
of
the
service
politeness
is
a
little
excessive
etiquette
rather
severe
amourpropre
somewhat
susceptible
m
du
marnet
who
was
preëminently
a
man
of
the
world
understood
at
once
from
the
attitude
of
m
fougas
that
he
was
not
in
the
presence
of
a
friend
the
punch
appeared
blazing
went
out
with
its
strength
unimpaired
and
was
dispensed
with
a
big
ladle
into
threescore
glasses
fougas
drank
with
everybody
except
m
du
marnet
the
conversation
which
was
erratic
and
noisy
imprudently
raised
a
question
of
comparative
merits
an
officer
of
cuirassiers
asked
fougas
if
he
had
seen
bordesoulles
splendid
charge
which
flung
the
austrians
into
the
valley
of
plauen
fougas
had
known
general
bordesoulle
personally
and
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
the
beautiful
heavy
cavalry
manoeuvre
which
decided
the
victory
of
dresden
but
he
chose
to
be
disagreeable
to
m
du
marnet
by
affecting
an
air
of
ignorance
or
indifference
in
our
time
said
he
the
cavalry
was
always
brought
into
action
after
the
battle
we
employed
it
to
bring
in
the
enemy
after
we
had
routed
them
here
a
great
outcry
arose
and
the
glorious
name
of
murat
was
thrown
into
the
balance
oh
doubtlessdoubtless
said
he
shaking
his
head
murat
was
a
good
general
in
his
limited
sphere
he
answered
perfectly
for
all
that
was
wanted
of
him
but
if
the
cavalry
had
murat
the
infantry
had
napoleon
m
du
marnet
observed
judiciously
that
napoleon
if
he
must
be
seized
upon
for
the
credit
of
any
single
arm
of
the
service
would
belong
to
the
artillery
with
all
my
heart
monsieur
replied
fougas
the
artillery
and
the
infantry
artillery
at
a
distance
infantry
at
close
quarterscavalry
off
at
one
side
once
more
i
beg
your
pardon
answered
m
du
marnet
you
mean
to
say
at
the
sides
which
is
a
very
different
matter
at
the
sides
or
at
one
side
i
dont
care
as
for
me
if
i
were
commanderinchief
i
would
set
the
cavalry
aside
several
cavalry
officers
had
already
flung
themselves
into
the
discussion
m
du
marnet
held
them
back
and
made
a
sign
that
he
wanted
to
answer
fougas
alone
and
why
then
if
you
please
would
you
set
the
cavalry
aside
because
the
dragoon
is
an
incomplete
soldier
incomplete
yes
sir
and
the
proof
is
that
the
government
has
to
buy
four
or
five
hundred
francs
worth
of
horse
in
order
to
complete
him
and
when
the
horse
receives
a
ball
or
a
bayonet
thrust
the
dragoon
is
no
longer
good
for
anything
have
you
ever
seen
a
cavalryman
on
foot
it
would
be
a
pretty
sight
i
see
myself
on
foot
every
day
and
i
dont
see
anything
particularly
ridiculous
about
it
im
too
polite
to
contradict
you
and
for
me
sir
i
am
too
just
to
combat
one
paradox
with
another
what
would
you
think
of
my
logic
if
i
were
to
say
to
you
the
idea
is
not
minei
found
it
in
a
book
if
i
were
to
say
to
you
i
entertain
a
high
regard
for
infantry
but
after
all
the
foot
soldier
is
an
incomplete
soldier
deprived
of
his
birthright
an
inefficient
body
deprived
of
that
natural
complement
of
the
soldier
called
a
horse
i
admire
his
courage
i
perceive
that
he
makes
himself
useful
in
battle
but
after
all
the
poor
devil
has
only
two
feet
at
his
command
while
we
have
four
you
see
fit
to
consider
a
dragoon
on
foot
ridiculous
but
does
the
footsoldier
always
make
a
very
brilliant
appearance
when
one
sticks
a
horse
between
his
legs
i
have
seen
excellent
infantry
captains
cruelly
embarrassed
when
the
minister
of
war
made
them
majors
they
said
scratching
their
heads
its
not
over
when
weve
mounted
a
grade
weve
got
to
mount
a
horse
in
the
bargain
this
crude
pleasantry
amused
the
audience
for
a
moment
they
laughed
and
the
mustard
mounted
higher
and
higher
in
fougas
nose
in
my
time
said
he
a
foot
soldier
became
a
dragoon
in
twentyfour
hours
and
if
any
one
would
like
to
make
a
match
with
me
on
horseback
sabre
in
hand
ill
show
him
what
infantry
is
monsieur
coolly
replied
m
du
marnet
i
hope
that
opportunities
will
not
be
lacking
to
you
in
the
field
of
battle
it
is
there
that
a
true
soldier
displays
his
talents
and
bravery
infantry
and
cavalry
we
alike
belong
to
france
i
drink
to
her
monsieur
and
i
hope
you
will
not
refuse
to
touch
glasses
with
meto
france
this
was
certainly
well
spoken
and
well
settled
the
clicking
of
glasses
applauded
m
du
marnet
fougas
himself
approached
his
adversary
and
drank
with
him
without
reserve
but
he
whispered
in
his
ear
speaking
very
thickly
i
hope
for
my
part
that
you
will
not
refuse
the
sabrematch
which
i
had
the
honor
to
propose
to
you
as
you
please
said
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
the
gentleman
from
the
other
world
drunker
than
ever
went
out
of
the
crowd
with
two
officers
whom
he
had
picked
up
haphazard
he
declared
to
them
that
he
considered
himself
insulted
by
m
du
marnet
that
a
challenge
had
been
given
and
accepted
and
that
the
affair
was
going
on
swimmingly
especially
added
he
in
confidence
since
there
is
a
lady
in
the
case
these
are
my
conditionsthey
are
all
in
accordance
with
the
honor
of
the
infantry
the
army
and
france
we
will
fight
on
horseback
stripped
to
the

mounted
bareback
on

sabre
first

i
want
to
chastise
a
puppy
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
rob
france
of
a
soldier
these
conditions
were
pronounced
absurd
by
m
du
marnets
seconds
they
accepted
them
nevertheless
for
the
military
code
requires
one
to
face
all
dangers
however
absurd
fougas
devoted
the
rest
of
the
day
to
worrying
the
poor
renaults
proud
of
the
control
he
exercised
over
clementine
he
declared
his
wishes
swore
he
would
take
her
for
his
wife
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
rank
family
and
fortune
and
prohibited
her
to
dispose
of
herself
before
that
time
he
broke
openly
with
leon
and
his
parents
refused
to
accept
their
good
offices
any
longer
and
quitted
their
house
after
a
serious
passage
of
high
words
leon
concluded
by
saying
that
he
would
only
give
up
his
betrothed
with
life
itself
the
colonel
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
his
back
carrying
off
without
stopping
to
consider
what
he
was
doing
the
fathers
clothes
and
the
sons
hat
he
asked
m
rollon
for
five
hundred
francs
engaged
a
room
at
the
hotel
du
cadronbleu
went
to
bed
without
any
supper
and
slept
straight
through
until
the
arrival
of
his
seconds
there
was
no
necessity
for
giving
him
an
account
of
what
had
passed
the
previous
day
the
fogs
of
punch
and
sleep
dissipated
themselves
in
an
instant
he
plunged
his
head
and
hands
into
a
basin
of
fresh
water
and
said
so
much
for
my
toilet
now
vive
lempereur
lets
go
and
get
into
line
the
field
selected
by
common
consent
was
the
paradegrounda
sandy
plain
enclosed
in
the
forest
at
a
good
distance
from
the
town
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
betook
themselves
there
of
their
own
accord
there
would
have
been
no
need
of
inviting
them
more
than
one
soldier
went
secretly
and
billeted
himself
in
a
tree
the
gendarmerie
itself
ornamented
the
little
family
fête
with
its
presence
people
went
to
see
an
encounter
in
chivalric
tourney
not
merely
between
the
infantry
and
the
cavalry
but
between
the
old
army
and
the
young
the
exhibition
fully
satisfied
public
expectation
no
one
was
tempted
to
hiss
the
piece
and
everybody
had
his
moneys
worth
precisely
at
nine
oclock
the
combatants
entered
the
lists
attended
by
their
four
seconds
and
the
umpire
of
the
field
fougas
naked
to
the
waist
was
as
handsome
as
a
young
god
his
lithe
and
agile
figure
his
proud
and
radiant
features
the
manly
grace
of
his
movements
assured
him
a
flattering
reception
he
made
his
english
horse
caper
and
saluted
the
lookerson
with
the
point
of
his
sword
m
du
marnet
a
man
rather
of
the
german
type
hardy
quite
hairy
moulded
like
the
indian
bacchus
and
not
like
achilles
showed
in
his
countenance
a
slight
shade
of
disgust
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
a
magician
to
understand
that
this
duel
in
naturalibus
under
the
eyes
of
his
own
officers
appeared
to
him
useless
and
even
ridiculous
his
horse
was
a
halfblood
from
perche
a
vigorous
beast
and
full
of
fire
fougas
seconds
rode
badly
enough
they
divided
their
attention
between
the
combat
and
their
stirrups
m
du
marnet
had
chosen
the
best
two
horsemen
in
his
regiment
a
major
and
captain
the
umpire
of
the
field
was
colonel
rollon
an
excellent
rider
at
a
signal
given
by
colonel
rollon
fougas
rode
directly
at
his
adversary
presenting
the
point
of
his
sabre
in
the
position
of
prime
like
a
cavalry
soldier
charging
infantry
in
a
hollow
square
but
he
reined
up
about
three
lengths
from
m
du
marnet
and
described
around
him
seven
or
eight
rapid
circles
like
an
arab
in
a
play
m
du
marnet
being
forced
to
turn
in
the
same
spot
and
defend
himself
on
all
sides
clapped
both
spurs
to
his
horse
broke
the
circle
took
to
the
field
and
threatened
to
commence
the
same
manoeuvre
about
fougas
but
the
gentleman
from
the
other
world
did
not
wait
for
him
he
rushed
off
at
a
full
gallop
and
made
a
round
of
the
hippodrome
always
followed
by
m
du
marnet
the
cuirassier
being
heavier
and
mounted
on
a
slower
horse
was
distanced
he
revenged
himself
by
calling
out
to
fougas
oh
monsieur
i
must
say
that
this
looks
more
like
a
race
than
a
battle
i
ought
to
have
brought
a
ridingwhip
instead
of
a
sword
but
fougas
panting
and
furious
had
already
turned
upon
him
hold
on
there
cried
he
i
have
shown
you
the
horseman
now
i
will
show
you
the
soldier
he
lanched
a
thrust
at
him
which
would
have
gone
through
him
like
a
hoop
if
m
du
marnet
had
not
been
as
prompt
as
at
parade
he
retorted
by
a
fine
cut
en
quarte
powerful
enough
to
cut
the
invincible
fougas
in
two
but
the
other
was
nimbler
than
a
monkey
he
wholly
shielded
his
body
by
letting
himself
slide
to
the
ground
and
then
remounted
his
horse
in
the
same
second
my
compliments
said
m
du
marnet
they
dont
do
any
better
than
that
in
the
circus
no
more
do
they
in
war
rejoined
the
other
ah
scoundrel
so
you
revile
the
old
army
heres
at
you
a
miss
thanks
for
the
retort
but
its
not
good
enough
yet
ill
not
die
from
any
such
thrust
as
that
how
do
you
like
thatand
thatand
that
ah
you
claim
that
the
footsoldier
is
an
incomplete
man
now
were
going
to
make
your
assortment
of
limbs
a
little
incomplete
look
out
for
your
boot
hes
parried
it
perhaps
he
expects
to
indulge
in
a
little
promenade
under
clementines
windows
this
evening
take
care
heres
for
clementine
and
heres
for
the
infantry
will
you
parry
that
so
traitor
and
that
so
he
does
perhaps
youll
parry
them
all
then
by
heavens
victory
ah
monsieur
your
blood
is
flowing
what
have
i
done
devil
take
the
sword
the
horse
and
all
major
major
come
quickly
monsieur
let
yourself
rest
in
my
arms
beast
that
i
am
as
if
all
soldiers
were
not
brothers
oh
forgive
me
my
friend
would
that
i
could
redeem
each
drop
of
your
blood
with
all
of
mine
miserable
fougas
incapable
of
mastering
his
fierce
passions
ah
you
esculapian
mars
i
beg
you
tell
me
that
the
thread
of
his
days
is
not
to
be
clipped
i
will
not
survive
him
for
he
is
a
brave
m
du
marnet
had
received
a
magnificent
cut
which
traversed
the
left
arm
and
breast
and
the
blood
was
streaming
from
it
at
a
rate
to
make
one
shudder
the
surgeon
who
had
provided
himself
with
hemostatic
preparations
hastened
to
arrest
the
hemorrhage
the
wound
was
long
rather
than
deep
and
could
be
cured
in
a
few
days
fougas
himself
carried
his
adversary
to
the
carriage
but
that
did
not
satisfy
him
he
firmly
insisted
on
joining
the
two
officers
who
took
m
du
marnet
home
he
overwhelmed
the
wounded
man
with
his
protestations
and
was
occupied
during
most
of
the
ride
in
swearing
eternal
friendship
to
him
on
reaching
the
house
he
put
him
to
bed
embraced
him
bathed
him
with
tears
and
did
not
leave
him
for
a
moment
until
he
heard
him
snoring
when
six
oclock
struck
he
went
to
dine
at
the
hotel
in
company
with
his
seconds
and
the
referee
all
of
whom
he
had
invited
after
the
fight
he
treated
them
magnificently
and
got
drunk
himself
as
usual
chapter
xv
in
which
the
reader
will
see
that
it
is
not
far
from
the
capital
to
the
tarpeian
rock
the
next
day
after
a
visit
to
m
du
marnet
he
wrote
thus
to
clementine
light
of
my
life
i
am
about
to
quit
these
scenes
the
witnesses
of
my
fatal
courage
and
the
repositories
of
my
love
to
the
bosom
of
the
capital
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
i
will
first
betake
my
steps
if
the
successor
of
the
god
of
combats
is
not
deaf
to
the
voice
of
the
blood
that
courses
in
his
veins
he
will
restore
me
my
sword
and
epaulettes
so
that
i
may
lay
them
at
thy
feet
be
faithful
to
mewait
hope
may
these
lines
be
to
thee
a
talisman
against
the
dangers
threatening
thy
independence
oh
my
clementine
tenderly
guard
thyself
for
thy
victor
fougas
clementine
sent
him
no
answer
but
just
as
he
was
getting
on
the
train
he
was
accosted
by
a
messenger
who
handed
him
a
pretty
red
leather
pocketbook
and
ran
away
with
all
his
might
the
pocketbook
was
entirely
new
solid
and
carefully
fastened
it
contained
twelve
hundred
francs
in
bank
notesall
the
young
girls
savings
fougas
had
no
time
to
deliberate
on
this
delicate
circumstance
he
was
pushed
into
a
car
the
locomotive
puffed
and
the
train
started
the
colonel
began
to
review
in
his
memory
the
various
events
which
had
succeeded
each
other
in
his
life
during
less
than
a
week
his
arrest
among
the
frosts
of
the
vistula
his
sentence
to
death
his
imprisonment
in
the
fortress
of
liebenfeld
his
reawakening
at
fontainebleau
the
invasion
of
the
return
from
the
island
of
elba
the
hundred
days
the
death
of
the
emperor
and
the
king
of
rome
the
restoration
of
the
bonapartes
in
his
meeting
with
a
young
girl
who
was
the
counterpart
of
clementine
pichon
in
all
respects
the
flag
of
the
d
the
duel
with
the
colonel
of
cuirassiersall
this
for
fougas
had
not
taken
up
more
than
four
days
the
night
reaching
from
the
th
of
november
to
the
th
of
august
seemed
to
him
even
a
little
shorter
than
any
of
the
others
for
it
was
the
only
time
that
he
had
had
a
full
sleep
without
any
dreaming
a
less
active
spirit
and
a
heart
less
warm
would
perhaps
have
lapsed
into
a
sort
of
melancholy
for
in
fact
one
who
has
been
asleep
for
fortysix
years
would
naturally
become
somewhat
alien
to
mankind
in
general
even
in
his
own
country
not
a
relation
not
a
friend
not
a
familiar
face
on
the
whole
face
of
the
earth
add
to
this
a
multitude
of
new
words
ideas
customs
and
inventions
which
make
him
feel
the
need
of
a
cicerone
and
prove
to
him
that
he
is
a
stranger
but
fougas
on
reopening
his
eyes
following
the
precept
of
horace
was
thrown
into
the
very
midst
of
action
he
had
improvised
for
him
friends
enemies
a
sweetheart
and
a
rival
fontainebleau
his
second
native
place
was
provisionally
the
central
point
of
his
existence
there
he
felt
himself
loved
hated
feared
admiredin
a
word
well
known
he
knew
that
in
that
subprefecture
his
name
could
not
be
spoken
without
awakening
an
echo
but
what
attached
him
more
than
all
to
modern
times
was
his
wellestablished
relationship
with
the
great
family
of
the
army
wherever
a
french
flag
floats
the
soldier
young
or
old
is
at
home
around
that
churchspire
of
the
fatherland
though
dear
and
sacred
in
a
way
different
from
the
village
spire
language
ideas
and
institutions
change
but
little
the
death
of
individuals
has
little
effect
they
are
replaced
by
others
who
look
like
them
and
think
talk
and
act
in
the
same
way
who
do
not
stop
on
assuming
the
uniform
of
their
predecessors
but
inherit
their
souvenirs
alsothe
glory
they
have
acquired
their
traditions
their
jests
and
even
certain
intonations
of
their
voices
this
accounts
for
fougas
sudden
friendship
after
a
first
feeling
of
jealousy
for
the
new
colonel
of
the
d
and
the
sudden
sympathy
which
he
evinced
for
m
du
marnet
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
blood
running
from
his
wound
quarrels
between
soldiers
are
family
quarrels
which
never
blot
out
the
relationship
calmly
satisfied
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
world
m
fougas
derived
pleasure
from
all
the
new
objects
which
civilization
placed
before
his
eyes
the
speed
of
the
railcars
fairly
intoxicated
him
he
was
inspired
with
a
positive
enthusiasm
for
this
force
of
steam
whose
theory
was
a
closed
book
to
him
but
on
whose
results
he
meditated
much
with
a
thousand
machines
like
this
two
thousand
rifled
cannon
and
two
hundred
thousand
such
chaps
as
i
am
napoleon
would
have
conquered
the
world
in
six
weeks
why
doesnt
this
young
fellow
on
the
throne
make
some
use
of
the
resources
he
has
under
his
control
perhaps
he
hasnt
thought
of
it
very
well
ill
go
to
see
him
if
he
looks
like
a
man
of
capacity
ill
give
him
my
idea
hell
make
me
minister
of
war
and
thenforward
march
he
had
explained
to
him
the
use
of
the
great
iron
wires
running
on
poles
all
along
the
road
the
very
thing
said
he
here
are
aidesdecamp
both
fleet
and
judicious
get
them
all
into
the
hands
of
a
chiefofstaff
like
berthier
and
the
universe
would
be
held
in
a
thread
by
the
mere
will
of
a
man
his
meditations
were
interrupted
a
couple
of
miles
from
melun
by
the
sounds
of
a
foreign
language
he
pricked
up
his
ears
and
then
bounded
from
his
corner
as
if
he
had
sat
on
a
pile
of
thorns
horror
it
was
english
one
of
those
monsters
who
had
assassinated
napoleon
at
st
helena
for
the
sake
of
insuring
to
themselves
the
cotton
monopoly
had
entered
the
compartment
with
a
very
pretty
woman
and
two
lovely
children
conductor
stop
cried
fougas
thrusting
his
body
halfway
out
of
the
window
monsieur
said
the
englishman
in
good
french
i
advise
you
to
have
patience
until
we
get
to
the
next
station
the
conductor
doesnt
hear
you
and
youre
in
danger
of
falling
out
on
the
track
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
i
have
a
flask
of
brandy
with
me
and
a
medicine
chest
no
sir
replied
fougas
in
a
most
supercilious
tone
im
in
want
of
nothing
and
id
rather
die
than
accept
anything
from
an
englishman
if
im
calling
the
conductor
its
only
because
i
want
to
get
into
a
different
car
and
cleanse
my
eyes
from
the
sight
of
an
enemy
of
the
emperor
i
assure
you
monsieur
responded
the
englishman
that
i
am
not
an
enemy
of
the
emperor
i
had
the
honor
of
being
received
by
him
while
he
was
in
london
he
even
deigned
to
pass
a
few
days
at
my
little
countryseat
in
lancashire
so
much
the
better
for
you
if
this
young
man
is
good
enough
to
forget
what
you
have
done
against
his
family
but
fougas
will
never
forgive
your
crimes
against
his
country
as
soon
as
they
arrived
at
the
station
at
melun
he
opened
the
door
and
rushed
into
another
saloon
there
he
found
himself
alone
in
the
presence
of
two
young
gentlemen
whose
physiognomies
were
far
from
english
and
who
spoke
french
with
the
purest
accent
of
touraine
both
had
coats
of
arms
on
their
sealrings
so
that
no
one
might
be
ignorant
of
their
rank
as
nobles
fougas
was
too
plebeian
to
fancy
the
nobility
much
but
as
he
had
left
a
compartment
full
of
britons
he
was
happy
to
meet
a
couple
of
frenchmen
friends
said
he
inclining
toward
them
with
a
cordial
smile
we
are
children
of
the
same
mother
long
life
to
you
your
appearance
revives
me
the
two
young
gentlemen
opened
their
eyes
very
wide
half
bowed
and
resumed
their
conversation
without
making
any
other
response
to
fougas
advance
well
then
my
dear
astophe
said
one
you
saw
the
king
at
froshdorf
yes
my
good
americ
and
he
received
me
with
the
most
affecting
condescension
vicomte
said
he
to
me
you
come
of
a
house
well
known
for
its
fidelity
we
will
remember
you
when
god
replaces
us
on
the
throne
of
our
ancestors
tell
our
brave
nobility
of
touraine
that
we
hope
to
be
remembered
in
their
prayers
and
that
we
never
forget
them
in
ours
pitt
and
coburg
said
fougas
between
his
teeth
here
are
two
little
rascals
conspiring
with
the
army
of
condé
but
patience
he
clenched
his
fists
and
opened
his
ears
didnt
he
say
anything
about
politics
a
few
vague
words
between
us
i
dont
think
he
bothers
with
them
much
he
is
waiting
upon
events
hell
not
wait
much
longer
who
can
tell
what
who
can
tell
the
empire
is
not
good
for
six
months
longer

montereau
said
so
again
last
monday
to
my
aunt
the
canoness
for
my
part
i
give
them
a
year
for
their
campaign
in
italy
has
strengthened
them
with
the
lower
orders
i
didnt
put
myself
out
to
tell
the
king
so
though
damnation
gentlemen
this
is
going
it
a
little
too
strongly
interrupted
fougas
is
it
here
in
france
that
frenchmen
speak
thus
of
french
institutions
go
back
to
your
master
tell
him
that
the
empire
is
eternal
because
it
is
founded
on
the
granite
of
popular
support
and
cemented
by
the
blood
of
heroes
and
if
the
king
asks
you
who
told
you
this
tell
him
it
was
colonel
fougas
who
was
decorated
at
wagram
by
the
emperors
own
hand
the
two
young
gentlemen
looked
at
each
other
exchanged
a
smile
and
the
viscount
said
to
the
marquis
what
is
that
a
madman
no
dear
a
mad
dog
nothing
else
very
well
gentlemen
cried
the
colonel
speak
english
youre
fit
for
it
he
changed
his
compartment
at
the
next
station
and
fell
in
with
a
lot
of
young
painters
he
called
them
disciples
of
zeuxis
and
asked
them
about
gérard
gros
and
david
these
gentlemen
found
the
sport
novel
and
recommended
him
to
go
and
see
talma
in
the
new
tragedy
of
arnault
the
fortifications
of
paris
dazzled
him
very
much
and
scandalized
him
a
little
i
dont
like
this
said
he
to
his
companions
the
true
rampart
of
a
capital
is
the
courage
of
a
great
people
this
piling
bastions
around
paris
is
saying
to
the
enemy
that
it
is
possible
to
conquer
france
the
train
at
last
stopped
at
the
mazas
station
the
colonel
who
had
no
baggage
marched
out
pompously
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
to
look
for
the
hôtel
de
nantes
as
he
had
spent
three
months
in
paris
about
the
year
he
considered
himself
acquainted
with
the
city
and
for
that
reason
he
did
not
fail
to
lose
himself
as
soon
as
he
got
there
but
in
the
various
quarters
which
he
traversed
at
hazard
he
admired
the
great
changes
which
had
been
wrought
during
his
absence
fougas
taste
was
for
having
streets
very
long
very
wide
and
bordered
with
very
large
houses
all
alike
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
that
the
parisian
style
was
rapidly
approaching
his
ideal
it
was
not
yet
absolute
perfection
but
progress
was
manifest
by
a
very
natural
illusion
he
paused
twenty
times
to
salute
people
of
familiar
appearance
but
no
one
recognized
him
after
a
walk
of
five
hours
he
reached
the
place
du
carrousel
the
hôtel
de
nantes
was
no
longer
there
but
the
louvre
had
been
erected
instead
fougas
employed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
regarding
this
monument
of
architecture
and
half
an
hour
in
contemplating
two
zouaves
of
the
guard
who
were
playing
piquet
he
inquired
if
the
emperor
was
in
paris
whereupon
his
attention
was
called
to
the
flag
floating
over
the
tuilleries
good
said
he
but
first
i
must
get
some
new
clothes
he
took
a
room
in
a
hotel
on
the
rue
saint
honoré
and
asked
a
waiter
which
was
the
most
celebrated
tailor
in
paris
the
waiter
handed
him
a
business
directory
fougas
hunted
out
the
emperors
bootmaker
shirtmaker
hatter
tailor
barber
and
glovemaker
he
took
down
their
names
and
addresses
in
clementines
pocketbook
after
which
he
took
a
carriage
and
set
out
as
he
had
a
small
and
shapely
foot
he
found
boots
readymade
without
any
difficulty
he
was
promised
too
that
all
the
linen
he
required
should
be
sent
home
in
the
evening
but
when
he
came
to
explain
to
the
hatter
what
sort
of
an
apparatus
he
intended
to
plant
on
his
head
he
encountered
great
difficulties
his
ideal
was
an
enormous
hat
large
at
the
crown
small
below
broad
in
the
brim
and
curved
far
down
behind
and
before
in
a
word
the
historic
heirloom
to
which
the
founder
of
bolivia
gave
his
name
long
ago
the
shop
had
to
be
turned
upside
down
and
all
its
recesses
searched
to
find
what
he
wanted
at
last
cried
the
hatter
heres
your
article
if
its
for
a
stage
dress
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
the
comic
effect
can
be
depended
upon
fougas
answered
dryly
that
the
hat
was
much
less
ridiculous
than
all
those
which
were
then
circulating
around
the
streets
of
paris
at
the
celebrated
tailors
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
there
was
almost
a
battle
no
monsieur
said
alfred
ill
never
make
you
a
frogged
surtout
and
a
pair
of
trousers
à
la
cosaque
go
to
babin
or
morean
if
you
want
a
carnival
dress
but
it
shall
never
be
said
that
a
man
of
as
good
figure
as
yours
left
our
establishment
caricatured
thunder
and
guns
retorted
fougas
youre
a
head
taller
than
i
am
mister
giant
but
im
a
colonel
of
the
grand
empire
and
it
wont
do
for
drummajors
to
give
orders
to
colonels
of
course
the
devil
of
a
fellow
had
the
last
word
his
measure
was
taken
a
book
of
costumes
consulted
and
a
promise
made
that
in
twentyfour
hours
he
should
be
dressed
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
of
cloths
were
presented
for
his
selection
among
them
some
english
fabrics
these
he
threw
aside
with
disgust
the
blue
cloth
of
france
cried
he
and
made
in
france
and
cut
it
in
such
a
style
that
any
one
seeing
me
in
pekin
would
say
thats
a
soldier
the
officers
of
our
day
have
precisely
the
opposite
fancy
they
make
an
effort
to
resemble
all
other
gentlemen
when
they
assume
the
civilians
dress
fougas
ordered
in
the
rue
richelieu
a
black
satin
scarf
which
hid
his
shirt
and
reached
up
to
his
ears
then
he
went
toward
the
palais
royal
entered
a
celebrated
restaurant
and
ordered
his
dinner
for
breakfast
he
had
only
taken
a
bite
at
a
pastrycooks
in
the
boulevard
so
his
appetite
which
had
been
sharpened
by
the
excursion
did
wonders
he
ate
and
drank
as
he
did
at
fontainebleau
but
the
bill
seemed
to
him
hard
to
digest
it
was
for
a
hundred
and
ten
francs
and
a
few
centimes
the
devil
said
he
living
has
become
dear
in
paris
brandy
entered
into
the
sum
total
for
an
item
of
nine
francs
they
had
given
him
a
bottle
and
a
glass
about
the
size
of
a
thimble
this
gimcrack
had
amused
fougas
and
he
diverted
himself
by
filling
and
emptying
it
a
dozen
times
but
on
leaving
the
table
he
was
not
drunk
an
amiable
gayety
inspired
him
but
nothing
more
it
occurred
to
him
to
get
back
some
of
his
money
by
buying
some
lottery
tickets
at
number
but
a
bottleseller
located
in
that
building
apprised
him
that
france
had
not
gambled
for
thirty
years
he
pushed
on
to
the
théâtre
français
to
see
if
the
emperors
actors
might
not
be
giving
some
fine
tragedy
but
the
poster
disgusted
him
modern
comedies
played
by
new
actors
neither
talma
nor
fleury
nor
thénard
nor
the
baptistes
nor
mlle
mars
nor
mlle
raucourt
he
then
went
to
the
opera
where
charles
vi
was
being
given
the
music
astounded
him
at
once
he
was
not
accustomed
to
hear
so
much
noise
anywhere
but
on
the
battlefield
nevertheless
his
ears
soon
inured
themselves
to
the
clangor
of
the
instruments
and
the
fatigue
of
the
day
the
pleasure
of
being
comfortably
seated
and
the
labor
of
digestion
plunged
him
into
a
doze
he
woke
up
with
a
start
at
this
famous
patriotic
song
guerre
aux
tyrans
jamais
jamais
en
france
jamais
langlais
ne
régnera
no
cried
he
stretching
out
his
arms
toward
the
stage
never
let
us
swear
it
together
on
the
sacred
altar
of
our
native
land
perish
perfidious
albion
vive
lempereur
the
pit
and
orchestra
arose
at
once
less
to
express
accord
with
fougas
sentiments
than
to
silence
him
during
the
following
entracte
a
commissioner
of
police
said
in
his
ear
that
when
one
had
dined
as
he
had
one
ought
to
go
quietly
to
bed
instead
of
interrupting
the
performance
of
the
opera
he
replied
that
he
had
dined
as
usual
and
that
this
explosion
of
patriotic
sentiment
had
not
proceeded
from
the
stomach
but
said
he
when
in
this
palace
of
misused
magnificence
hatred
of
the
enemy
is
stigmatized
as
a
crime
i
must
go
and
breathe
a
freer
air
and
bow
before
the
temple
of
glory
before
i
go
to
bed
youll
do
well
to
do
so
said
the
policeman
he
went
out
haughtier
and
more
erect
than
ever
reached
the
boulevard
and
ran
with
great
strides
as
far
as
the
corinthian
temple
at
the
end
while
on
his
way
he
greatly
admired
the
lighting
of
the
city
m
martout
had
explained
to
him
the
manufacture
of
gas
he
had
not
understood
anything
about
it
but
the
glowing
and
ruddy
flame
was
an
actual
treat
to
his
eyes
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
the
monument
commanding
the
entrance
to
the
rue
royale
he
stopped
on
the
pavement
collected
his
thoughts
for
an
instant
and
exclaimed
oh
glory
inspirer
of
great
deeds
widow
of
the
mighty
conqueror
of
europe
receive
the
homage
of
thy
devoted
victor
fougas
for
thee
i
have
endured
hunger
sweat
and
frost
and
eaten
the
most
faithful
of
horses
for
thee
i
am
ready
to
brave
further
perils
and
again
to
face
death
on
every
battlefield
i
seek
thee
rather
than
happiness
riches
or
power
reject
not
the
offering
of
my
heart
and
the
sacrifice
of
my
blood
as
the
price
of
such
devotion
i
ask
nothing
but
a
smile
from
thy
eyes
and
a
laurel
from
thy
hand
this
prayer
went
all
glowing
to
the
ears
of
saint
marie
madeleine
the
patroness
of
the
extemple
of
glory
thus
the
purchaser
of
a
chateau
sometimes
receives
a
letter
addressed
to
the
original
proprietor
fougas
returned
by
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
the
place
vendôme
and
saluted
in
passing
the
only
familiar
figure
he
had
yet
found
in
paris
the
new
costume
of
napoleon
on
the
column
did
not
displease
him
in
any
way
he
preferred
the
cocked
hat
to
a
crown
and
the
gray
surtout
to
a
theatrical
cloak
the
night
was
restless
in
the
colonels
brain
a
thousand
diverse
projects
crossed
each
other
in
all
directions
he
prepared
the
little
speech
which
he
should
make
to
the
emperor
going
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
a
phrase
and
waking
up
with
a
start
in
the
attempt
to
lay
hold
on
the
idea
which
had
so
suddenly
vanished
he
put
out
and
relit
his
candle
twenty
times
the
recollection
of
clementine
was
occasionally
intermingled
with
dreams
of
war
and
political
utopias
but
i
must
confess
that
the
young
girls
figure
seldom
got
any
higher
than
the
second
place
but
if
the
night
appeared
too
long
the
morning
seemed
short
in
proportion
the
idea
of
meeting
the
new
master
of
the
empire
face
to
face
inspired
and
chilled
him
in
turn
for
an
instant
he
hoped
that
something
would
be
lacking
in
his
toiletthat
some
shopkeeper
would
furnish
him
an
honorable
pretext
for
postponing
his
visit
until
the
next
day
but
everybody
displayed
the
most
desperate
punctuality
precisely
at
noon
the
trousers
à
la
cosaque
and
the
frogged
surtout
were
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
opposite
the
famous
bolivar
hat
i
may
as
well
be
dressing
said
fougas
possibly
this
young
man
may
not
be
at
home
in
that
case
ill
leave
my
name
and
wait
until
he
sends
for
me
he
got
himself
up
gorgeously
in
his
own
way
and
although
it
may
appear
impossible
to
my
readers
fougas
in
a
black
satin
scarf
and
frogged
surtout
was
not
homely
nor
even
ridiculous
his
tall
figure
lithe
build
lofty
and
impressive
carriage
and
brusque
movements
were
all
in
a
certain
harmony
with
the
costume
of
the
olden
time
he
appeared
strange
and
that
was
all
to
keep
his
courage
up
he
dropped
into
a
restaurant
ate
four
cutlets
a
loaf
of
bread
a
slice
of
cheese
and
washed
it
all
down
with
two
bottles
of
wine
the
coffee
and
supplements
brought
him
up
to
two
oclock
and
that
was
the
time
he
had
set
for
himself
he
tipped
his
hat
slightly
over
one
ear
buttoned
his
buckskin
gloves
coughed
energetically
two
or
three
times
before
the
sentinel
at
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
marched
bravely
into
the
gate
monsieur
cried
the
porter
what
do
you
want
the
emperor
have
you
an
audience
letter
colonel
fougas
does
not
need
one
go
and
ask
references
of
him
who
towers
over
the
place
vendôme
hell
tell
you
that
the
name
of
fougas
has
always
been
a
synonym
for
bravery
and
fidelity
you
knew
the
first
emperor
yes
my
little
joker
and
i
have
talked
with
him
just
as
i
am
talking
with
you
indeed
but
how
old
are
you
then
seventy
years
on
the
dialplate
of
time
twentyfour
years
on
the
tablets
of
history
the
porter
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
murmured
still
another
this
makes
the
fourth
for
this
week
he
made
a
sign
to
a
little
gentleman
in
black
who
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
court
of
the
tuilleries
then
he
said
to
fougas
putting
his
hand
on
his
arm
so
my
good
friend
you
want
to
see
the
emperor
ive
already
told
you
so
familiar
individual
very
well
you
shall
see
him
today
that
gentleman
going
along
there
with
the
pipe
in
his
mouth
is
the
one
who
introduces
visitors
he
will
take
care
of
you
but
the
emperor
is
not
in
the
palace
he
is
in
the
country
its
all
the
same
to
you
isnt
it
if
you
do
have
to
go
into
the
country
what
the
devil
do
you
suppose
i
care
only
i
dont
suppose
you
care
to
go
on
foot
a
carriage
has
already
been
ordered
for
you
come
my
good
fellow
get
in
and
be
reasonable
two
minutes
later
fougas
accompanied
by
a
detective
was
riding
to
a
police
station
his
business
was
soon
disposed
of
the
commissary
who
received
him
was
the
same
one
who
had
spoken
to
him
the
previous
evening
at
the
opera
a
doctor
was
called
and
gave
the
best
verdict
of
monomania
that
ever
sent
a
man
to
charenton
all
this
was
done
politely
and
pleasantly
without
a
word
which
could
put
the
colonel
on
his
guard
or
give
him
a
suspicion
of
the
fate
held
in
reserve
for
him
he
merely
found
the
ceremonial
rather
long
and
peculiar
and
prepared
on
the
spot
several
wellsounding
sentences
which
he
promised
himself
the
honor
of
repeating
to
the
emperor
at
last
he
was
permitted
to
resume
his
route
the
hack
had
been
kept
waiting
the
gentlemanusher
relit
his
pipe
said
three
words
to
the
driver
and
seated
himself
at
the
left
of
the
colonel
the
carriage
set
off
at
a
trot
reached
the
boulevards
and
took
the
direction
of
the
bastille
it
had
gotten
opposite
the
porte
saintmartin
and
fougas
with
his
head
at
the
window
was
continuing
the
composition
of
his
impromptu
speech
when
an
open
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
superb
chestnuts
passed
so
to
speak
under
his
very
nose
a
portly
man
with
a
gray
moustache
turned
his
head
and
cried
fougas
robinson
crusoe
discovering
the
human
footprint
on
his
island
was
not
more
astonished
and
delighted
than
our
hero
on
hearing
that
cry
of
fougas
to
open
the
door
jump
out
into
the
road
run
to
the
carriage
which
had
been
stopped
fling
himself
into
it
at
a
single
bound
without
the
help
of
the
step
and
fall
into
the
arms
of
the
portly
gentleman
with
the
gray
moustache
was
all
the
work
of
a
second
the
barouche
had
long
disappeared
when
the
detective
at
a
gallop
followed
by
his
hack
at
a
trot
traversed
the
line
of
the
boulevards
asking
all
the
policemen
if
they
had
not
seen
a
crazy
man
pass
that
way
chapter

memorable
interview

was
made
brigadiergeneral

isly

during
that
year
we

a
june
campaign
in
paris

my
heart
still
bleeds
every
time

think
of
it
and
upon
my
soul
youre
blest
in
not

seen
it
i
got
three
balls
in
my
body
and
a
commission
as
general
of
division
after
all
ive
no
right
to
complain
for
the
campaign
in
italy
brought
me
good
luck
here
i
am
marshal
of
france
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
income
and
duke
of
solferino
in
the
bargain
yes
the
emperor
has
put
a
handle
to
my
name
the
fact
is
that
short
leblanc
was
a
little
too
short
thunderation
cried
fougas
thats
splendid
i
swear
leblanc
that
im
not
jealous
of
your
good
fortune
its
seldom
enough
that
one
soldier
rejoices
over
the
promotion
of
another
but
indeed
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
assure
you
that
i
do
now
its
all
the
better
since
you
deserved
your
honors
and
the
blind
goddess
must
have
had
a
glimpse
of
your
heart
and
talents
over
the
bandage
that
covers
her
eyes
youre
very
kind
but
lets
talk
about
yourself
now
where
were
you
going
when
i
met
you
to
see
the
emperor
so
was
i
but
where
the
devil
were
you
looking
for
him
i
dont
know
somebody
was
showing
me
the
way
but
he
is
at
the
tuilleries
no
yes
theres
something
under
all
this
tell
me
about
it
fougas
did
not
wait
to
be
urged
the
marshal
soon
understood
from
what
sort
of
danger
he
had
extricated
his
friend
the
concierge
is
mistaken
said
he
the
emperor
is
at
the
palace
and
as
weve
reached
there
now
come
with
me
perhaps
i
can
present
you
after
my
audience
the
very
thing
leblanc
my
heart
beats
at
the
idea
of
seeing
this
young
man
is
he
a
good
one
can
he
be
counted
upon
is
he
anything
like
the
other
you
can
see
for
yourself
wait
here
the
friendship
of
these
two
men
dated
from
the
winter
of
during
the
retreat
of
the
french
army
chance
flung
the
lieutenant
of
artillery
and
the
colonel
of
the
d
together
one
was
eighteen
years
old
the
other
not
quite
twentyfour
the
distance
between
their
ranks
was
easily
bridged
over
by
common
danger
all
men
are
equal
before
hunger
cold
and
fatigue
one
morning
leblanc
at
the
head
of
ten
men
rescued
fougas
from
the
hands
of
the
cossacks
then
fougas
sabred
a
half
dozen
stragglers
who
were
trying
to
steal
leblancs
cloak
eight
days
later
leblanc
pulled
his
friend
out
of
a
hut
which
the
peasants
had
set
on
fire
and
fougas
in
turn
fished
leblanc
out
of
the
beresina
the
list
of
their
dangers
and
their
mutual
services
is
too
long
for
me
to
give
entire
to
finish
off
the
colonel
at
koenigsberg
passed
three
weeks
at
the
bedside
of
the
lieutenant
who
was
attacked
with
fever
and
ague
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
tender
care
saved
his
life
this
reciprocal
devotion
had
formed
between
them
bonds
so
strong
that
a
separation
of
fortysix
years
could
not
break
them
fougas
alone
in
a
great
saloon
was
buried
in
the
recollections
of
that
good
old
time
when
an
usher
asked
him
to
remove
his
gloves
and
go
into
the
cabinet
of
the
emperor
respect
for
the
powers
that
be
which
is
the
very
foundation
of
my
character
does
not
permit
me
to
bring
august
personages
upon
the
scene
but
fougas
correspondence
belongs
to
contemporaneous
history
and
here
is
the
letter
which
he
wrote
to
clementine
on
returning
to
his
hotel
paris
what
am
i
sayingheaven
aug
my
sweet
angel
i
am
intoxicated
with
joy
gratitude
and
admiration
i
have
seen
him
i
have
spoken
to
him
he
gave
me
his
hand
he
made
me
be
seated
he
is
a
great
prince
he
will
be
the
master
of
the
world
he
gave
me
the
medal
of
st
helena
and
the
cross
of
an
officer
little
leblanc
an
old
friend
and
a
true
heart
conducted
me
into
his
presence
he
is
marshal
of
france
too
and
a
duke
of
the
new
empire
as
for
promotion
theres
no
more
need
of
speculation
on
that
head
a
prisoner
of
war
in
prussia
and
in
a
triple
coffin
i
return
with
my
rank
so
says
the
military
law
but
in
less
than
three
months
i
shall
be
a
brigadiergeneralthats
certain
he
deigned
to
promise
it
to
me
himself
what
a
man
a
god
on
earth
no
more
conceited
than
he
of
wagram
and
moscow
and
like
him
the
father
of
the
soldier
he
wanted
to
give
me
money
from
his
private
purse
to
replace
my
equipments
i
answered
no
sire
i
have
a
claim
to
recover
at
dantzic
if
it
is
paid
i
shall
be
rich
if
the
debt
is
denied
my
pay
will
suffice
for
me
thereupon
o
beneficence
of
princes
thou
art
not
then
but
an
empty
name
he
smiled
slightly
and
said
twisting
his
moustache

sire
what
goodness
now
theres
an
idea
which
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
to
squeeze
money
out
of
prussiaprussia
who
showed
herself
so
greedy
for
our
treasures
in

vive

and
magnanimous

prince
imperial
i
saw
them
the
emperor
presented
me
to
his
family
the
prince
is
an
admirable
little
soldier
he
condescended
to
beat
the
drum
on
my
new
hat
i
wept
with
emotion
her
majesty
the
empress
said
with
an
angelic
smile
that
she
had
heard
my
misfortunes
spoken
of
oh
madame
i
replied
such
a
moment
as
this
compensates
them
a
hundred
foldyou
must
come
and
dance
at
the
tuilleries
next
winteralas
madame
i
have
never
danced
but
to
the
music
of
cannon
but
i
shall
spare
no
effort
to
please
you
i
will
study
the
art
of
vestrisive
managed
to
learn
the
quadrille
very
nicely
joined
in
leblanc
the
emperor
deigned
to
express
his
happiness
at
getting
back
an
officer
like
me
who
had
yesterday
so
to
speak
taken
part
in
the
finest
campaigns
of
the
century
and
retained
all
the
traditions
of
the
great
war
this
encouraged
me
i
no
longer
feared
to
remind
him
of
the
famous
principle
of
the
good
old
timeto
treat
for
peace
only
in
capitals
take
care
said
he
it
was
on
the
strength
of
that
principle
that
the
allied
armies
twice
came
to
settle
the
basis
of
peace
at
paristheyll
not
come
here
again
cried
i
without
passing
over
my
body
i
dwelt
upon
the
troubles
apt
to
come
from
too
much
intimacy
with
england
i
expressed
a
hope
of
at
once
proceeding
to
the
conquest
of
the
world
first
to
get
back
our
frontiers
for
ourselves
next
the
natural
frontiers
of
europe
for
europe
is
but
the
suburb
of
france
and
cannot
he
annexed
too
soon
the
emperor
shook
his
head
as
if
he
was
not
of
my
opinion
does
he
entertain
peaceful
designs
i
do
not
wish
to
dwell
upon
this
idea
it
would
kill
me
he
asked
me
what
impressions
i
had
formed
regarding
the
appearance
of
the
changes
which
had
been
made
in
paris
i
answered
with
the
sincerity
of
a
lofty
soul
sire
the
new
paris
is
the
great
work
of
a
great
reign
but
i
entertain
the
hope
that
your
improvements
have
not
yet
had
the
finishing
touchwhat
is
left
to
be
done
now
in
your
opinionfirst
of
all
to
remedy
the
course
of
the
seine
whose
irregular
curve
is
positively
shocking
the
straight
line
is
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points
for
rivers
as
well
as
boulevards
in
the
second
place
to
level
the
ground
and
suppress
all
inequalites
of
surface
which
seem
to
say
to
the
government
thou
art
less
powerful
than
nature
having
accomplished
this
preparatory
work
i
would
trace
a
circle
three
leagues
in
diameter
whose
circumference
marked
by
an
elegant
railing
should
be
the
boundary
of
paris
at
the
centre
i
would
build

the

listened
to
me
patiently
and
twisted
his
moustache
your

said
he
would
cost
a
triflenot
much
more
than
the
one
already
adopted
answered
i
at
this
remark
an
unreserved
hilarity
the
cause
of
which
i
am
unable
to
explain
lit
up
his
serious
countenance
dont
you
think
said
he
that
your
project
would
ruin
a
great
many
peopleeh
what
difference
does
it
make
to
me
i
cried
since
it
will
ruin
none
but
the
rich
he
began
laughing
again
and
bid
me
farewell
saying
colonel
you
will
have
to
remain
colonel
only
until
we
make
you
brigadiergeneral
he
permitted
me
to
press
his
hand
a
second
time
i
waved
an
adieu
to
brave
leblanc
who
has
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
this
evening
and
i
returned
to
my
hotel
to
pour
my
joy
into
your
sweet
soul

on
you
shall
be
happy
and
i
shall
be
great
tomorrow

want

v
fougas
the
subscribers
to
la
patrie
who
keep
files
of
their
paper
are
hereby
requested
to
hunt
up
the
number
for
the
d
of
august
in
it
they
will
find
two
paragraphs
of
local
intelligence
which
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
copying
here
his
excellency
the
marshal
the
duke
of
solferino
yesterday
had
the
honor
of
presenting
to
his
majesty
the
emperor
a
hero
of
the
first
empire
colonel
fougas
whom
an
almost
miraculous
event
already
mentioned
in
a
report
to
the
academy
of
sciences
has
restored
to
his
country
such
was
the
first
paragraph
here
is
the
second
a
madman
the
fourth
this
week
but
the
most
dangerous
of
all
presented
himself
yesterday
at
one
of
the
entrances
of
the
tuilleries
decked
out
in
a
grotesque
costume
his
eyes
flashing
his
hat
cocked
over
his
ear
and
addressing
the
most
respectable
people
with
unheardof
rudeness
he
attempted
to
force
his
way
past
the
sentry
and
thrust
himself
for
what
purpose
god
only
knows
into
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
during
his
incoherent
ejaculations
the
following
words
were
distinguished
bravery
vendôme
column
fidelity
the
dialplate
of
time
the
tablets
of
history
when
he
was
arrested
by
one
of
the
detective
watch
and
taken
before
the
police
commissioner
of
the
tuilleries
section
he
was
recognized
as
the
same
individual
who
the
evening
before
at
the
opera
had
interrupted
the
performance
of
charles
vi
with
most
unseemly
cries
after
the
customary
medical
and
legal
proceedings
he
was
ordered
to
be
sent
to
the
charenton
hospital
but
opposite
the
porte
saintmartin
taking
advantage
of
a
lock
among
the
vehicles
and
of
the
herculean
strength
with
which
he
is
endowed
he
wrested
his
hands
from
his
keeper
threw
him
down
beat
him
leaped
at
a
bound
into
the
street
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
the
most
active
search
was
immediately
set
on
foot
and
we
have
it
from
the
best
authority
that
the
police
are
already
on
the
track
of
the
fugitive
chapter
xvii
wherein
herr
nicholas
meiser
one
of
the
solid
men
of
dantzic
receives
an
unwelcome
visit
the
wisdom
of
mankind
declares
that
illgotten
gains
never
do
any
good
i
maintain
that
they
do
the
robbers
more
good
than
the
robbed
and
the
good
fortune
of
herr
nicholas
meiser
is
an
argument
in
support
of
my
proposition
the
nephew
of
the
illustrious
physiologist
after
brewing
a
great
deal
of
beer
from
a
very
little
hops
and
prematurely
appropriating
the
legacy
intended
for
fougas
had
amassed
by
various
operations
a
fortune
of
from
eight
to
ten
millions
in
what
kind
of
operations
no
one
ever
told
me
but
i
know
that
he

are
specimens
of
the
speculations
which
the
good
man
did
not
despise
he
never
boasted
of
them
for
he
was
modest
but
he
never
blushed
for
them
for
he
had
expanded
his
conscience
simultaneously
with
his
capital
as
for
the
rest
he
was
a
man
of
honor
in
the
commercial
sense
of
the
word
and
capable
of
strangling
the
whole
human
race
rather
than
of
letting
his
signature
be
protested
the
banks
of
dantzic
berlin
vienna
and
paris
held
him
in
high
esteem
his
money
passed
through
all
of
them
he
was
fat
unctuous
and
florid
and
lived
well
his
wifes
nose
was
much
too
long
and
her
bones
much
too
prominent
but
she
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
and
made
him
little
sweetmeats
a
perfect
congeniality
of
sentiment
united
this
charming
couple
they
talked
with

other
with
open
hearts

never

of
keeping
back
any
of

evil

every

they

who
could
not

for
their
terms
but
they
dined
none
the
worse
after
it
and
their
goodnight
kiss
was
none
the
less
sweet
the
husband
was
sixtysix
years
old
the
wife
sixtyfour
their
physiognomies
were
such
as
inspire
benevolence
and
command
respect
to
complete
their
outward
resemblance
to
the

nothing
was
needed
but
children
and

nature
had
given
them

only

they

unhappily
this
only
child
the

to
so
many

died
at
the

of
heidelberg
from
eating

many
sausages
he
set
out
when
he
was
twenty
for
that
valhalla
of
german
students
where
they
eat
infinite
sausages
and
drink
inexhaustible
beer
where
they
sing
songs
of
eight
hundred
million
verses
and
gash
the
tips
of
each

noses
with
huge
swords
envious
death
snatched
him
from
his
parents
when
they
were
no
longer
of
an
age
to
improvise
a
successor
the
unfortunate
old
millionnaires
tenderly
collected
his
effects
to
sell
them
during
this
operation
so
trying
to
their
souls
for
there
was
a
great
deal
of
brandnew
linen
that
could
not
be
found
nicholas
meiser
said
to
his
wife
my
heart
bleeds
at
the
idea
that
our
buildings
and
dollars
our
goods
above
ground
and
under
should
go
to
strangers
parents
ought
always
to
have
an
extra
son
just
as
they
have
a
viceumpire
in
the
chamber
of
commerce
but
time
who
is
a
great
teacher
in
germany
and
several
other
countries
led
them
to
see
that
there
is
consolation
for
all
things
except
the
loss
of
money
five
years
afterwards
frau
meiser
said
to
her
husband
with
a
tender
and
philosophic
smile
who
can
fathom
the
decrees
of
providence
perhaps
your
son
would
have
brought
us
to
a
crust
look
at
theobald
scheffler
his
old
comrade
he
wasted
twenty
thousand
francs
at
paris
on
a
woman
who
kicked
up
her
legs
in
the
middle
of
a
quadrille
we
ourselves
spent
more
than
two
thousand
thalers
a
year
for
our
wicked
scapegrace
his
death
is
a
great
saving
and
therefore
a
good
thing
as
long
as
the
three
coffins
of
fougas
were
in
the
house
the
good
dame
scolded
at
the
visions
and
restlessness
of
her
husband
what
in
the
name
of
sense
are
you
thinking
about
youve
been
kicking
me
all
night
again
lets
throw
this
ragamuffin
of
a
frenchman
into
the
fire
then
hell
no
longer
disturb
the
repose
of
a
peaceable
family
we
can
sell
the
leaden
box
it
must
weigh
at
least
two
hundred
pounds
the
white
silk
will
make
me
a
good
lining
for
a
dress
and
the
wool
in
the
stuffing
will
easily
make
us
a
mattress
but
a
tinge
of
superstition
prevented
meiser
from
following
his
wifes
advice
he
preferred
to
rid
himself
of
the
colonel
by
selling
him
the
house
of
this
worthy
couple
was
the
handsomest
and
most
substantial
on
the
street
of
public
wells
in
the
aristocratic
part
of
the
city
strong
railings
in
iron
open
work
decorated
all
the
windows
magnificently
and
the
door
was
sheathed
in
iron
like
a
knight
of
the
olden
time
a
system
of
little
mirrors
ingeniously
arranged
in
the
entrance
enabled
a
visitor
to
be
seen
before
he
had
even
knocked
a
single
servant
a
regular
horse
for
work
and
camel
for
temperance
ministered
under
this
roof
blessed
by
the
gods
the
old
servant
slept
away
from
the
house
both
because
he
preferred
to
and
because
while
he
did
so
he
could
not
be
tempted
to
wring
the
venerable
necks
of
his
employers
a
few
books
on
commerce
and
religion
constituted
the
library
of
the
two
old
people
they
never
cared
to
have
a
garden
at
the
back
of
their
house
because
the
shrubbery
might
conceal
thieves
they
fastened
their
door
with
bolts
every
evening
at
eight
oclock
and
never
went
out
without
being
obliged
to
for
fear
of
meeting
dangerous
people
and
nevertheless
on
the
th
of
april
at
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
nicholas
meiser
was
far
away
from
his
beloved
home
gracious
how
very
far
away
for
himthis
honest
burgher
of
dantzic
he
was
traversing
with
heavy
tread
the
promenade
in
berlin
which
bears
the
name
of
one
of
alphonse
karrs
romances
sous
les
tilleuls
in
german
unter
den
linden
what
mighty
agency
had
thrown
out
of
his
bonbon
box
this
big
red
bonbon
on
two
legs
the
same
that
led
alexander
to
babylon
scipio
to
carthage
godfrey
de
bouillon
to
jerusalem
and
napoleon
to
moscowambition
meiser
did
not
expect
to
be
presented
with
the
keys
of
the
city
on
a
cushion
of
red
velvet
but
he
knew
a
great
lord
a
clerk
in
a
government
office
and
a
chambermaid
who
were
working
to
get
a
patent
of
nobility
for
him
to
call
himself
von
meiser
instead
of
plain
meiser
what
a
glorious
dream
this
good
man
had
in
his
character
that
compound
of
meanness
and
vanity
which
places
lacqueys
so
far
apart
from
the
rest
of
mankind
full
of
respect
for
power
and
admiration
for
conventional
greatness
he
never
pronounced
the
name
of
king
prince
or
even
baron
without
emphasis
and
unction
he
mouthed
every
aristocratic
syllable
and
the
single
word
monseigneur
seemed
to
him
like
a
mouthful
of
wellspiced
soup
examples
of
this
disposition
are
not
rare
in
germany
and
are
even
occasionally
found
elsewhere
if
they
could
be
transported
to
a
country
where
all
men
are
equal
homesickness
for
bootlicking
would
kill
them
the
claims
brought
to
bear
in
favor
of
nicholas
meiser
were
not
of
the
kind
which
at
once
spring
the
balance
but
of
the
kind
which
make
it
turn
little
by
little
nephew
of
an
illustrious
man
of
science
powerfully
rich
a
man
of
sound
judgment
a
subscriber
to
the
new
gazette
of
the
cross
full
of
hatred
for
the
opposition
author
of
a
toast
against
the
influence
of
demagogues
once
a
member
of
the
city
council
once
an
umpire
in
the
chamber
of
commerce
once
a
corporal
in
the
militia
and
an
open
enemy
of
poland
and
all
nations
but
the
strong
ones
his
most
brilliant
action
dated
back
ten
years
he
had
denounced
by
an
anonymous
letter
a
member
of
the
french
parliament
who
had
taken
refuge
in
dantzic
while
meiser
was
walking
under
the
lindens
his
cause
was
progressing
swimmingly
he
had
received
that
sweet
assurance
from
the
very
lips
of
its
promoters
and
so
he
tripped
lightly
toward
the
depot
of
the
northeastern
railroad
without
any
other
baggage
than
a
revolver
in
his
pocket
his
black
leather
trunk
had
gone
before
and
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
station
on
the
way
he
was
glancing
into
the
shop
windows
when
he
stopped
short
before
a
stationers
and
rubbed
his
eyesa
sovereign
remedy
people
say
for
impaired
vision
between
the
portraits
of
mme
sand
and
m
mérimée
the
two
greatest
writers
of
france
he
had
noticed
examined
recognized
a
wellknown
countenance
surely
said
he
ive
seen
that
man
before
but
he
was
paler
can
our
old
lodger
have
come
to
life
impossible
i
burned
up
my
uncles
directions
so
the
world
has
lostthanks
to
methe
secret
of
resuscitating
people
nevertheless
the
resemblance
is
striking
is
it
a
portrait
of
colonel
fougas
taken
from
life
in
no
for
photography
was
not
then
invented
but
possibly
its
a
photograph
copied
from
an
engraving
here
are
louis
xvi
and
marie
antoinette
reproduced
in
the
same
way
that
doesnt
prove
that
robespierre
had
them
resuscitated
anyhow
ive
had
an
unfortunate
encounter
he
took
a
step
toward
the
door
of
the
shop
to
reassure
himself
but
a
peculiar
reluctance
held
him
back
people
might
wonder
at
him
ask
him
questions
try
to
learn
the
reason
of
his
trouble
he
resumed
his
walk
at
a
brisk
pace
trying
to
reassure
himself
bah
its
an
hallucinationthe
result
of
dwelling
too
much
on
one
idea
moreover
the
portrait
was
dressed
in
the
style
of
that
settles
the
question
he
reached
the
station
had
his
black
leather
trunk
checked
and
flung
himself
down
at
full
length
in
a
firstclass
compartment
first
he
smoked
his
porcelain
pipe
but
his
two
neighbors
being
asleep
he
soon
followed
their
example
and
began
snoring
now
this
big
mans
snores
had
something
aweinspiring
about
them
you
could
have
fancied
yourself
listening
to
the
trumpets
of
the
judgment
day
what
shade
visited
him
in
this
hour
of
sleep
no
other
soul
has
ever
known
for
he
kept
his
dreams
to
himself
as
he
did
everything
that
was
his
but
between
two
stations
while
the
train
was
running
at
full
speed
he
distinctly
felt
two
powerful
hands
pulling
at
his
feeta
sensation
alas
too
well
known
and
one
which
called
up
the
ugliest
recollections
of
his
life
he
opened
his
eyes
in
terror
and
saw
the
man
of
the
photograph
in
the
costume
of
the
photograph
his
hair
stood
on
end
his
eyes
grew
as
big
as
saucers
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
flung
himself
headlong
between
the
seats
among
the
legs
of
his
neighbors
a
few
vigorous
kicks
brought
him
to
himself
he
got
up
as
well
as
he
could
and
looked
about
him
no
one
was
there
but
the
two
gentlemen
opposite
who
were
mechanically
lanching
their
last
kicks
into
the
empty
space
and
rubbing
their
eyes
with
their
arms
he
succeeded
in
awakening
them
and
asked
them
about
the
visitation
he
had
had
but
the
gentlemen
declared
they
had
seen
nothing
meiser
sadly
returned
to
his
own
thoughts
he
noticed
that
the
visions
appeared
terribly
real
this
idea
prevented
his
going
to
sleep
again
if
this
goes
on
much
longer
thought
he
the
colonels
ghost
will
break
my
nose
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
or
give
me
a
pair
of
black
eyes
a
little
later
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
breakfasted
very
hastily
that
morning
and
he
reflected
that
the
nightmare
had
perhaps
been
brought
about
by
such
dieting
he
got
off
at
the
next
fiveminute
stoppingplace
and
called
for
soup
some
very
hot
vermicelli
was
brought
him
and
he
blew
into
his
bowl
like
a
dolphin
into
the
bosphorus
a
man
passed
before
him
without
jostling
him
without
saying
anything
to
him
without
even
seeing
him
and
nevertheless
the
bowl
dropped
from
the
hands
of
the
rich
nicholas
meiser
the
vermicelli
poured
over
his
waistcoat
and
shirtbosom
where
it
formed
an
elegant
fretwork
suggestive
of
the
architecture
of
the
porte
saint
martin
some
yellowish
threads
detached
from
the
mass
hung
in
stalactites
from
the
buttons
of
his
coat
the
vermicelli
stopped
on
the
outside
but
the
soup
penetrated
much
further
it
was
rather
warm
for
pleasure
an
egg
left
in
it
ten
minutes
would
have
been
boiled
hard
fatal
soup
which
not
only
distributed
itself
among
the
pockets
but
into
the
most
secret
sinuosities
of
the
man
himself
the
starting
bell
rang
the
waiter
collected
his
two
sous
and
meiser
got
into
the
cars
preceded
by
a
plaster
of
vermicelli
and
followed
by
a
little
thread
of
soup
which
was
running
down
the
calves
of
his
legs
and
all
of
this
because
he
had
seen
or
thought
he
had
seen
the
terrible
figure
of
colonel
fougas
eating
sandwiches
oh
how
long
the
trip
seemed
what
a
terrible
time
it
appeared
to
be
before
he
could
be
at
home
between
his
wife
catharine
and
his
servant
berbel
with
all
the
doors
safely
closed
his
two
companions
laughed
till
the
buttons
flew
people
laughed
in
the
compartment
to
the
right
of
him
and
in
the
compartment
to
the
left
of
him
as
fast
as
he
picked
off
the
vermicelli
little
spots
of
soup
saucily
congealed
and
seemed
quietly
laughing
how
hard
it
comes
to
a
great
millionnaire
to
amuse
people
who
do
not
possess
a
cent
he
did
not
get
off
again
until
they
reached
dantzic
he
did
not
even
put
his
nose
to
the
window
he
sucked
solitary
consolation
from
his
porcelain
pipe
on
which
leda
caressed
her
swan
and
smiled
not
wearisome
wearisome
journey
but
he
did
reach
home
nevertheless
it
was
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
the
old
domestic
was
waiting
with
ropes
to
sling
his
masters
trunk
on
his
back
no
more
alarming
figures
no
more
mocking
laughs
the
history
of
the
soup
was
fallen
into
the
great
forgotten
like
one
of
m
hellers
speeches
in
the
baggage
room
meiser
had
already
seized
the
handle
of
a
black
leather
trunk
when
at
the
other
end
he
saw
the
spectre
of
fougas
which
was
pulling
in
the
opposite
direction
and
seemed
inclined
to
dispute
possession
he
bristled
up
pulled
stronger
and
even
plunged
his
left
hand
into
the
pocket
where
the
revolver
was
lying
but
the
luminous
glance
of
the
colonel
fascinated
him
his
legs
trembled
he
fell
and
fancied
that
he
saw
fougas
and
the
black
trunk
rolling
over
each
other
when
he
came
to
his
old
servant
was
chafing
his
hands
the
trunk
already
had
the
slings
around
it
and
the
colonel
had
disappeared
the
domestic
swore
that
he
had
not
seen
anybody
and
that
he
had
himself
received
the
trunk
from
the
baggage
agents
own
hand
twenty
minutes
later
the
millionnaire
was
in
his
own
house
joyfully
rubbing
his
face
against
the
sharp
angles
of
his
wife
he
did
not
dare
to
tell
her
about
his
visions
for
frau
meiser
was
a
skeptic
in
her
own
way
it
was
she
who
spoke
to
him
about
fougas
a
whole
history
has
happened
to
me
said
she
would
you
believe
that
the
police
have
written
to
us
from
berlin
to
find
out
whether
our
uncle
left
us
a
mummy
and
when
and
how
long
we
kept
him
and
what
we
have
done
with
him
i
answered
telling
the
truth
and
adding
that
colonel
fougas
was
in
such
a
bad
condition
and
so
damaged
by
mites
that
we
sold
him
for
rags
what
object
can
the
police
have
in
troubling
themselves
about
our
affairs
meiser
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
lets
talk
about
money
said
the
lady
the
president
of
the
bank
has
been
to
see
me
the
million
you
asked
him
for
for
tomorrow
is
ready
it
will
be
delivered
upon
your
signature
it
seems
that
theyve
had
a
deal
of
trouble
to
get
the
amount
in
specie
if
you
had
but
wanted
drafts
on
vienna
or
paris
you
would
have
put
them
at
their
ease
but
at
last
theyve
done
what
you
wanted
theres
no
other
news
except
that
schmidt
the
merchant
has
killed
himself
he
had
to
pay
a
note
for
ten
thousand
thalers
and
didnt
have
half
the
amount
on
hand
he
came
to
ask
me
for
the
money
i
offered
him
ten
thousand
thalers
at
twentyfive
per
cent
payable
in
ninety
days
with
a
first
mortgage
on
all
his
real
estate
the
fool
preferred
to
hang
himself
in
his
shop
everyone
to
his
taste
did
he
hang
himself
very
high
i
dont
know
anything
about
that
why
because
one
might
get
a
piece
of
rope
cheap
and
were
greatly
in
want
of
some
my
poor
catharine
that
colonel
fougas
has
given
me
a
shiver
some
more
of
your
notions
come
to
supper
my
love
come
on
the
angular
baucis
conducted
her
philemon
into
a
large
and
beautiful
diningroom
where
berbel
served
a
repast
worthy
of
the
gods
soup
with
little
balls
of
aniseeded
bread
fishballs
with
black
sauce
muttonballs
stuffed
game
balls
sourkrout
cooked
in
lard
and
garnished
with
fried
potatoes
roast
hare
with
currant
jelly
deviled
crabs
salmon
from
the
vistula
jellies
and
fruit
tarts
six
bottles
of
rhinewine
selected
from
the
best
vintages
were
awaiting
in
their
silver
caps
the
masters
kiss
but
the
lord
of
all
these
good
things
was
neither
hungry
nor
thirsty
he
ate
by
nibbles
and
drank
by
sips
all
the
time
expecting
a
grand
consummation
which
he
did
not
have
to
expect
along
a
formidable
rap
of
the
knocker
soon
resounded
through
the
house
nicholas
meiser
trembled
his
wife
tried
to
reassure
him
its
nothing
said
she
the
president
of
the
bank
told
me
that
he
was
coming
to
see
you
he
offers
to
pay
us
the
exchange
if
well
take
paper
instead
of
specie
it
is
about
money
sure
as
fate
cried
the
good
man
hell
itself
is
coming
to
see
us
at
the
same
instant
the
servant
rushed
into
the
room
crying
oh
sir
oh
madame
its
the
frenchman
of
the
three
coffins
jesus
mary
mother
of
god
fougas
saluted
them
and
said
dont
disturb
yourselves
good
people
i
beg
of
you
weve
a
little
matter
to
discuss
together
and
im
ready
to
explain
it
to
you
in
two
words
youre
in
a
hurry
so
am
i
youve
not
had
supper
neither
have
i
frau
meiser
more
rigid
and
more
emaciated
than
a
thirteenthcentury
statue
opened
wide
her
toothless
mouth
terror
paralyzed
her
the
man
better
prepared
for
the
visit
of
the
phantom
cocked
his
revolver
under
the
table
and
took
aim
at
the
colonel
crying
vade
retro
satanas
the
exorcism
and
the
pistol
missed
fire
together
meiser
was
not
at
all
discouraged
he
snapped
the
six
barrels
one
after
the
other
at
the
demon
who
stood
watching
him
do
it
not
one
went
off
what
devilish
game
is
that
youre
playing
said
the
colonel
seating
himself
astride
a
chair
people
are
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
an
honest
mans
visit
with
that
ceremony
meiser
flung
down
his
revolver
and
grovelled
like
a
beast
at
fougas
feet
his
wife
who
was
not
one
whit
more
tranquil
followed
him
they
joined
hands
and
the
fat
man
exclaimed
spirit
i
confess
my
misdeeds
and
i
am
ready
to
make
reparation
for
them
i
have
sinned
against
you
i
have
violated
my
uncles
commands
what
do
you
wish
what
do
you
command
a
tomb
a
magnificent
monument
prayers
endless
prayers
idiot
said
fougas
spurning
him
with
his
foot
i
am
no
spirit
and
i
want
nothing
but
the
money
youve
robbed
me
of
meiser
kept
rolling
on
the
floor
but
his
scrawny
wife
was
already
on
her
feet
her
fists
on
her
hips
and
facing
fougas
money
cried
she
but
we
dont
owe
you
any
have
you
any
documents
just
show
us
our
signature
where
would
one
be
just
god
if
we
had
to
give
money
to
all
the
adventurers
who
present
themselves
and
in
the
first
place
by
what
right
did
you
thrust
yourself
into
our
dwelling
if
youre
not
a
spirit
ah
youre
a
man
just
the
same
as
other
people
ha
ha
so
youre
not
a
ghost
very
well
sir
there
are
judges
in
berlin
there
are
some
in
the
country
too
and
well
soon
see
whether
youre
going
to
finger
our
money
get
up
there
you
great
booby
its
only
a
man
and
do
you
mister
ghost
get
out
of
here
off
with
you
the
colonel
did
not
budge
more
than
a
rock
the
devils
in
womens
tongues
sit
down
old
lady
and
take
your
hands
away
from
my
eyesthey
bother
me
and
as
for
you
swellhead
get
on
to
your
chair
and
listen
to
me
there
will
be
time
enough
to
go
to
law
if
we
cant
come
to
an
understanding
but
stamped
paper
stinks
in
my
nostrils
and
therefore
id
rather
settle
peaceably
herr
and
frau
meiser
repressed
their
first
emotion
they
distrusted
magistrates
as
do
all
people
without
clean
consciences
if
the
colonel
was
a
poor
devil
who
could
be
put
off
with
a
few
thalers
it
would
be
better
to
avoid
legal
proceedings
fougas
stated
the
case
to
them
with
entire
military
bluntness
he
proved
the
existence
of
his
right
said
that
he
had
had
his
identity
substantiated
at
fontainebleau
paris
and
berlin
cited
from
memory
two
or
three
passages
of
the
will
and
finished
by
declaring
that
the
prussian
government
in
conjunction
with
that
of
france
would
support
his
just
claims
if
necessary
you
understand
clearly
said
he
taking
meiser
by
the
button
of
his
coat
that
i
am
no
fox
depending
on
cunning
if
you
had
a
wrist
vigorous
enough
to
swing
a
good
sabre
wed
take
the
field
against
each
other
and
id
play
you
for
the
amount
first
two
cuts
out
of
three
as
surely
as
thats
soup
before
you
fortunately
monsieur
said
meiser
my
age
shields
me
from
all
brutality
you
would
not
wish
to
trample
under
foot
the
corpse
of
an
old
man
venerable
scoundrel
but
you
would
have
killed
me
like
a
dog
if
your
pistol
had
not
missed
fire
it
was
not
loaded
monsieur
colonel
it
was
notanywhere
near
loaded
but
i
am
an
accommodating
man
and
we
can
come
to
terms
very
easily
i
dont
owe
you
anything
and
moreover
theres
prescription
but
after
allhow
much
do
you
want
he
has
had
his
say
now
its
my
turn
the
old
rascals
mate
softened
the
tone
of
her
voice
imagine
to
yourself
a
saw
licking
a
tree
before
biting
in
listen
claus
my
dearlisten
to
what
monsieur
colonel
fougas
has
to
say
youll
see
that
he
is
reasonable
its
not
in
him
to
think
of
ruining
poor
people
like
us
oh
heavens
he
is
not
capable
of
it
he
has
such
a
noble
heart
such
a
disinterested
man
an
officer
worthy
of
the
great
napoleon
god
receive
his
soul
thats
enough
old
lady
said
fougas
with
a
curt
gesture
which
cut
the
speech
off
in
the
middle
i
had
an
estimate
made
at
berlin
of
what
is
due
meprincipal
and
interest
interest
cried
meiser
but
in
what
country
in
what
latitude
do
people
pay
interest
on
money
perhaps
it
may
sometimes
happen
in
business
but
between
friendsnever
no
never
my
good
monsieur
colonel
what
would
my
good
uncle
who
is
now
gazing
upon
us
from
heaven
say
if
he
knew
that
you
were
claiming
interest
on
his
bequest
now
shut
up
nickle
interrupted
his
wife
monsieur
colonel
is
just
about
telling
you
himself
that
he
did
not
intend
to
be
understood
as
speaking
of
the
interest
why
in
the
name
of
great
guns
dont
you
both
shut
up
you
confounded
magpies
here
i
am
dying
of
hunger
and
i
didnt
bring
my
nightcap
to
go
to
bed
here
either
now
heres
the
upshot
of
the
matter
you
owe
me
a
great
deal
but
its
not
an
even
sumthere
are
fractions
in
it
and
i
go
in
for
clean
transactions
moreover
my
tastes
are
modest
ive
enough
for
my
wife
and
myself
nothing
more
is
needed
than
to
provide
for
my
son
very
well
cried
meiser
ill
charge
myself
with
the
education
of
the
little
fellow
now
during
the
dozen
days
since
i
again
became
a
citizen
of
the
world
there
is
one
word
that
ive
heard
spoken
everywhere
at
paris
as
well
as
at
berlin
people
no
longer
speak
of
anything
but
millions
there
is
no
longer
any
talk
of
anything
else
and
everybodys
mouth
is
full
of
millions
from
hearing
so
much
said
about
it
ive
acquired
a
curiosity
to
know
what
it
is
go
fetch
me
out
a
million
and
ill
give
you
quittance
if
you
want
to
reach
an
approximate
idea
of
the
piercing
cries
which
answered
him
go
to
the
jardin
des
plantes
at
the
breakfast
hour
of
the
birds
of
prey
and
try
to
pull
the
meat
out
of
their
beaks
fougas
stopped
his
ears
and
remained
inexorable
prayers
arguments
misrepresentations
flatteries
cringings
glanced
off
from
him
like
rain
from
a
zinc
roof
but
at
ten
oclock
at
night
when
he
had
concluded
that
all
concurrence
was
impossible
he
took
his
hat
good
evening
said
he
its
no
longer
a
million
that
i
must
have
but
two
millions
and
all
over
well
go
to
law
im
going
to
supper
he
was
on
the
staircase
when
frau
meiser
said
to
her
husband
call
him
back
and
give
him
his
million
are
you
a
fool
dont
be
afraid
i
can
never
do
it
father
in
heaven
what
blockheads
men
are
monsieur
monsieur
fougas
monsieur
colonel
fougas
come
up
again
i
pray
you
we
consent
to
all
that
you
require
damnation
said
he
on
reëntering
you
ought
to
have
made
up
your
minds
sooner
but
after
all
lets
see
the
money
frau
meiser
explained
to
him
with
her
tenderest
voice
that
poor
capitalists
like
themselves
were
not
in
the
habit
of
keeping
millions
under
their
own
lock
and
key
but
you
shall
lose
nothing
by
waiting
my
sweet
sir
tomorrow
you
shall
handle
the
amount
in
nice
white
silver
my
husband
will
sign
you
a
check
on
the
royal
bank
of
dantzic
but
said
the
unfortunate
meiser
he
signed
nevertheless
for
he
had
boundless
confidence
in
the
practical
ingenuity
of
catharine
the
old
lady
begged
fougas
to
sit
down
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
dictated
to
him
a
receipt
for
two
millions
in
payment
of
all
demands
you
may
depend
that
she
did
not
forgot
a
word
of
the
legal
formulas
and
that
she
arranged
the
affair
in
due
form
according
to
the
prussian
code
the
receipt
written
throughout
in
the
colonels
hand
filled
three
large
pages
he
signed
the
instrument
with
a
flourish
and
received
in
exchange
the
signature
of
nicholas
which
he
knew
well
well
said
he
to
the
old
gentleman
youre
certainly
not
such
an
arab
as
they
said
you
were
at
berlin
shake
hands
old
scamp
i
dont
usually
shake
hands
with
any
but
honest
people
but
on
an
occasion
like
this
one
can
do
a
little
something
extra
do
it
double
monsieur
fougas
said
frau
meiser
humbly
will
you
not
join
us
in
this
modest
supper
gad
old
lady
its
not
a
thing
to
be
refused
my
supper
must
be
cold
at
the
inn
of
the
clock
and
your
viands
smoking
on
their
chafing
dishes
have
already
caused
me
more
than
one
fit
of
distraction
besides
here
are
some
yellow
glass
flutes
on
which
fougas
will
not
be
at
all
reluctant
to
play
an
air
the
respectable
catharine
had
an
extra
plate
laid
and
ordered
berbel
to
go
to
bed
the
colonel
folded
up
father
meisers
million
rolled
it
carefully
among
a
pile
of
bankbills
and
put
the
whole
into
the
little
pocketbook
which
his
dear
clementine
had
sent
him
the
clock
struck
eleven
at
halfpast
eleven
fougas
began
to
see
everything
in
a
rosy
cloud
he
praised
the
rhine
wine
highly
and
thanked
the
meisers
for
their
hospitality
at
midnight
he
assured
them
of
his
highest
esteem
at
quarter
past
twelve
he
embraced
them
at
halfpast
twelve
he
delivered
a
eulogy
on
the
illustrious
john
meiser
his
friend
and
benefactor
when
he
learned
that
john
meiser
had
died
in
that
house
he
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
tears
at
quarter
to
one
he
assumed
a
confidential
tone
and
spoke
of
his
son
whom
he
was
going
to
make
happy
and
of
the
betrothed
who
was
waiting
for
him
about
one
oclock
he
tasted
a
celebrated
port
wine
which
frau
meiser
had
herself
gone
to
bring
from
the
cellar
about
halfpast
one
his
tongue
thickened
and
his
eyes
grew
dim
he
struggled
some
time
against
drunkenness
and
sleepiness
announced
that
he
was
going
to
describe
the
russian
campaign
muttered
the
name
of
the
emperor
and
slid
under
the
table
you
may
believe
me
if
you
will
said
frau
meiser
to
her
husband
this
is
not
a
man
who
has
come
into
our
house
its
the
devil
the
devil
if
not
would
i
have
advised
you
to
give
him
a
million
i
heard
a
voice
saying
to
me
if
you
do
not
obey
the
messenger
of
the
infernal
powers
you
will
both
die
this
very
night
it
was
on
account
of
that
that
i
called
him
up
stairs
ah
if
we
had
been
doing
business
with
a
man
i
would
have
told
you
to
contest
it
in
law
to
our
last
cent
as
you
please
so
youre
still
making
sport
of
my
visions
forgive
me
claus
dear
i
was
a
fool
and
ive
concluded
i
was
too
poor
innocent
perhaps
you
too
thought
this
was
colonel
fougas
certainly
as
if
it
were
possible
to
resuscitate
a
man
it
is
a
demon
i
tell
you
who
assumed
the
shape
of
the
colonel
to
rob
us
of
our
money
what
can
demons
do
with
money
build
cathedrals
to
be
sure
but
how
is
the
devil
to
be
recognized
when
he
is
disguised
first
by
his
clovenfootbut
this
one
has
boots
on
next
by
his
clipped
ear
bah
and
why
because
the
devils
ears
are
pointed
and
in
order
to
make
them
round
he
has
to
cut
them
meiser
stuck
his
head
under
the
table
and
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
its
certainly
the
devil
said
he
but
how
did
he
happen
to
let
himself
go
to
sleep
perhaps
you
did
not
know
that
when
i
came
back
from
the
cellar
i
dropped
into
my
chamber
i
put
a
drop
of
holy
water
into
the
port
charm
against
charm
and
he
is
fallen
thats
splendid
but
what
shall
we
do
with
him
now
that
we
have
him
in
our
power
what
is
done
with
demons
in
scripture
the
saviour
throws
them
into
the
sea
the
sea
is
a
long
way
from
here
but
you
big
baby
the
public
wells
are
just
by
and
what
will
be
said
tomorrow
when
the
body
is
found
nothing
at
all
will
be
found
and
even
the
check
that
we
signed
will
be
turned
into
tinder
ten
minutes
later
herr
and
frau
meiser
were
lugging
something
toward
the
public
wells
and
soon
dame
catharine
murmured
sotto
voce
the
following
incantation
demon
child
of
hell
be
thou
accursed
demon
child
of
hell
be
thou
dashed
headlong
down
demon
child
of
hell
return
to
hell
a
dull
soundthe
sound
of
a
body
falling
into
water
terminated
the
ceremony
and
the
two
spouses
returned
to
their
domicil
with
the
satisfaction
that
always
follows
the
performance
of
a
duty
nicholas
said
to
himself
i
didnt
think
she
was
so
credulous
i
didnt
think
he
was
so
simple
thought
the
worthy
kettle
wedded
wife
of
claus
they
slept
the
sleep
of
innocence
oh
how
much
less
soft
their
pillows
would
have
seemed
if
fougas
had
gone
home
with
his
million
at
ten
oclock
the
next
morning
while
they
were
taking
their
coffee
and
buttered
rolls
the
president
of
the
bank
called
in
and
said
to
them
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
having
accepted
a
draft
on
paris
instead
of
a
million
in
specie
and
without
premium
too
that
young
frenchman
you
sent
to
us
is
a
little
brusque
but
very
lively
and
a
good
fellow

the
colonel
tries
to
relieve
himself
of
a
million
which
incumbers
him
fougas
had
left
paris
for
berlin
the
day
after
his
audience
he
took
three
days
to
make
the
trip
because
he
stopped
some
time
at
nancy
the
marshal
had
given
him
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
prefect
of
meurthe
who
received
him
very
politely
and
promised
to
aid
him
in
his
investigations
unfortunately
the
house
where
he
had
loved
clementine
pichon
was
no
longer
standing
the
authorities
had
demolished
it
in
in
cutting
a
street
through
it
is
certain
that
the
commissioners
had
not
demolished
the
family
with
the
house
but
a
new
difficulty
all
at
once
presented
itself
the
name
of
pichon
abounded
in
the
city
the
suburbs
and
the
department
among
this
multitude
of
pichons
fougas
did
not
know
which
one
to
hug
tired
of
hunting
and
eager
to
hasten
forward
on
the
road
to
fortune
he
left
this
note
for
the
commissioner
of
police
search
on
the
registers
of
personal
statistics
and
elsewhere
for
a
young
girl
named
clementine
pichon
she
was
eighteen
years
old
in
her
parents
kept
an
officers
boardinghouse
if
she
is
alive
get
her
address
if
she
is
dead
look
up
her
heirs
a
fathers
happiness
depends
upon
it
on
reaching
berlin
the
colonel
found
that
his
reputation
had
preceded
him
the
note
from
the
minister
of
war
had
been
sent
to
the
prussian
government
through
the
french
legation
leon
renault
despite
his
grief
had
found
time
to
write
a
word
to
doctor
hirtz
the
papers
had
begun
to
talk
and
the
scientific
societies
to
bestir
themselves
the
prince
regent
even
had
not
disdained
to
ask
information
on
the
subject
from
his
physician
germany
is
a
queer
country
where
science
interests
the
very
princes
fougas
who
had
read
doctor
hirtzs
letter
annexed
to
herr
meisers
will
thought
that
he
owed
some
acknowledgments
to
that
excellent
gentleman
he
made
a
call
upon
him
and
embraced
him
addressing
him
as
the
oracle
of
epidaurus
the
doctor
at
once
took
possession
of
him
had
his
baggage
brought
from
the
hotel
and
gave
him
the
best
chamber
in
his
house
up
to
the
th
day
of
the
month
the
colonel
was
cared
for
as
a
friend
and
exhibited
as
a
phenomenon
seven
photographers
disputed
the
possession
of
so
precious
a
sitter
the
cities
of
greece
did
no
more
for
our
poor
old
homer
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
wished
to
see
him
in
propriâ
personâ
and
begged
herr
hirtz
to
bring
him
to
the
palace
fougas
scratched
his
ear
a
little
and
intimated
that
a
soldier
ought
not
to
associate
with
the
enemy
seeming
to
think
himself
still
in
the
prince
is
a
distinguished
soldier
having
commanded
in
person
at
the
famous
siege
of
rastadt
he
took
pleasure
in
fougas
conversation
the
heroic
simplicity
of
the
young
oldtime
soldier
charmed
him
he
paid
him
huge
compliments
and
said
that
the
emperor
of
france
was
very
fortunate
in
having
around
him
officers
of
so
much
merit
he
has
not
a
great
many
replied
the
colonel
if
there
were
but
four
or
five
hundred
of
my
stamp
your
europe
would
have
been
bagged
long
ago
this
answer
seemed
more
amusing
than
threatening
and
no
addition
was
immediately
made
to
the
available
portion
of
the
prussian
army
his
royal
highness
directly
informed
fougas
that
his
indemnity
had
been
fixed
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
and
that
he
could
receive
the
amount
at
the
treasury
whenever
he
should
find
it
agreeable
my
lord
replied
he
it
is
always
agreeable
to
pocket
the
money
of
an
enemya
foreigner
but
wait
i
am
not
a
censorbearer
to
plutus
give
me
back
the
rhine
and
posen
and
ill
leave
you
your
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
are
you
dreaming
said
the
prince
laughing
the
rhine
and
posen
the
rhine
belongs
to
france
and
the
posen
to
poland
much
more
legitimately
than
this
money
to
me
but
so
it
is
with
great
lords
they
make
it
a
duty
to
pay
little
debts
and
a
point
of
honor
to
ignore
big
ones
the
prince
winced
a
little
and
all
the
faces
of
the
court
gave
a
sympathetic
twitch
it
was
discovered
that
m
fougas
had
evinced
bad
taste
in
letting
a
crumb
of
truth
fall
into
a
big
plateful
of
follies
but
a
pretty
little
viennese
baroness
who
was
at
the
presentation
was
much
more
charmed
with
his
appearance
than
scandalized
at
his
remarks
the
ladies
of
vienna
have
made
for
themselves
a
reputation
for
hospitality
which
they
always
attempt
to
support
even
when
they
are
away
from
their
native
land
the
baroness
of
marcomarcus
had
still
another
reason
for
getting
hold
of
the
colonel
for
two
or
three
years
she
had
as
a
matter
of
course
been
making
a
photographic
collection
of
celebrated
men
her
album
was
peopled
with
generals
statesmen
philosophers
and
pianists
who
had
given
their
portraits
to
her
after
writing
on
the
back
with
respects
of
there
were
to
be
found
there
several
roman
prelates
and
even
a
celebrated
cardinal
but
a
more
direct
envoy
from
the
other
world
was
still
wanting
she
wrote
fougas
then
a
note
full
of
impatience
and
curiosity
inviting
him
to
supper
fougas
who
was
going
to
start
for
dantzic
next
day
took
a
sheet
of
paper
embossed
with
a
great
eagle
and
set
to
work
to
excuse
himself
politely
he
fearedthe
delicate
and
chivalrous
soulthat
an
evening
of
conversation
and
enjoyment
in
the
society
of
the
loveliest
women
of
germany
might
be
a
sort
of
moral
infidelity
to
the
recollection
of
clementine
he
accordingly
hunted
up
an
eligible
formula
of
address
and
wrote
too
indulgent
beauty
i
the
muse
dictated
nothing
more
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
writing
he
felt
rather
more
in
the
mood
for
supper
his
scruples
scattered
like
clouds
driven
before
a
brisk
north
east
wind
he
put
on
the
frogged
surtout
and
carried
his
reply
himself
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
out
to
supper
since
his
resuscitation
he
gave
evidence
of
a
good
appetite
and
got
moderately
drunk
but
not
as
much
so
as
usual
the
baroness
de
marcomarcus
astonished
at
his
high
spirits
and
inexhaustible
vivacity
kept
him
as
long
as
she
could
and
moreover
she
said
to
her
friends
on
showing
them
the
colonels
portrait
nothing
is
needed
but
these
french
officers
to
conquer
the
world
the
next
day
he
packed
a
black
leather
trunk
which
he
had
bought
at
paris
drew
his
money
from
the
treasury
and
set
out
for
dantzic
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
cars
because
he
had
been
out
to
supper
the
night
before
a
terrible
snoring
awoke
him
he
looked
around
for
the
snorer
and
not
finding
him
near
him
opened
the
door
into
the
adjoining
compartment
for
the
german
cars
are
much
larger
than
the
french
and
shook
a
fat
gentleman
who
seemed
to
have
a
whole
organ
playing
in
his
person
at
one
of
the
stations
he
drank
a
bottle
of
marsala
and
ate
a
couple
of
dozen
sandwiches
for
last
nights
supper
seemed
to
have
hollowed
out
his
stomach
at
dantzic
he
rescued
his
black
trunk
from
the
hands
of
an
enormous
baggagesnatcher
who
was
trying
to
take
possession
of
it
he
went
to
the
best
hotel
in
the
place
ordered
his
supper
and
hastened
to
meisers
house
his
friends
at
berlin
had
given
him
accounts
of
that
charming
family
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
deal
with
the
richest
and
most
avaricious
of
sharpers
that
was
why
he
assumed
the
cavalier
tone
that
may
have
seemed
strange
to
more
than
one
reader
in
the
preceding
chapter
unhappily
he
let
himself
become
a
little
too
human
as
soon
as
he
had
his
million
in
his
pocket
a
curiosity
to
investigate
the
long
yellow
bottles
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
came
near
doing
him
an
ugly
turn
his
reason
wandered
about
one
oclock
in
the
morning
if
i
am
to
believe
the
account
he
himself
gave
he
said
that
after
saying
good
night
to
the
excellent
people
who
had
treated
him
so
well
he
tumbled
into
a
large
and
deep
well
whose
rim
was
hardly
raised
above
the
level
of
the
street
and
ought
at
least
to
have
had
a
lamp
by
it
i
came
to
it
is
still
he
speaking
in
water
very
fresh
and
of
a
pleasant
taste
after
swimming
around
a
minute
or
two
looking
for
a
firm
place
to
take
hold
of
i
seized
a
big
rope
and
climbed
without
any
trouble
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
which
was
not
more
than
forty
feet
off
it
required
nothing
but
wrists
and
a
little
gymnastic
skill
and
was
not
much
of
a
feat
anyhow
on
getting
on
to
the
pavement
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
sort
of
night
watchman
who
was
bawling
the
hours
through
the
street
and
who
asked
me
insolently
what
i
was
doing
there
i
thrashed
him
for
his
impudence
and
the
gentle
exercise
did
me
good
as
it
set
my
blood
well
in
circulation
again
before
getting
back
to
the
inn
i
stopped
under
a
street
lamp
opened
my
pocketbook
and
saw
with
pleasure
that
my
million
was
not
wet
the
leather
was
thick
and
the
clasp
firm
moreover
i
had
enveloped
herr
meisers
check
in
a
halfdozen
hundredfranc
bills
in
a
roll
as
fat
as
a
monk
these
surroundings
had
preserved
it
this
examination
being
made
he
went
home
went
to
bed
and
slept
with
his
fists
clenched
the
next
morning
he
received
on
getting
up
the
following
memoranda
which
came
from
the
nancy
police
clementine
pichon
aged
eighteen
minor
daughter
of
auguste
pichon
hotelkeeper
and
leonie
francelot
was
married
in
this
town
january
to
louis
antoine
langevin
profession
not
stated
the
name
of
langevin
is
as
rare
in
this
department
as
the
name
of
pichon
is
common
with
the
exception
of
the
hon
m
victor
langevin
counsellor
to
the
prefecture
at
nancy
there
is
only
known
langevin
pierre
usually
called
pierrot
miller
in
the
commune
of
vergaville
canton
of
dieuze
fougas
jumped
nearly
to
the
ceiling
crying
i
have
a
son
he
called
the
hotelkeeper
and
said
to
him
make
out
my
bill
and
send
my
baggage
to
the
depot
take
my
ticket
for
nancy
i
shall
not
stop
on
the
way
here
are
two
hundred
francs
with
which
i
want
you
to
drink
to
the
health
of
my
son
he
is
called
victor
after
me
he
is
counsellor
of
the
prefecture
id
rather
he
were
a
soldier
but
never
mind
ah
first
get
somebody
to
show
me
the
way
to
the
bank
i
must
go
and
get
a
million
for
him
as
there
is
no
direct
connection
between
dantzic
and
nancy
he
was
obliged
to
stop
at
berlin
m
hirtz
whom
he
met
accidentally
told
him
that
the
scientific
societies
of
the
city
were
preparing
an
immense
banquet
in
his
honor
but
he
declined
positively
its
not
said
he
that
i
despise
an
opportunity
to
drink
in
good
company
but
nature
has
spoken
her
voice
draws
me
on
the
sweetest
intoxication
to
all
rightly
constituted
hearts
is
that
of
paternal
love
to
prepare
his
dear
child
for
the
joy
of
a
return
so
little
expected
he
enclosed
his
million
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
m
victor
langevin
with
a
long
letter
which
closed
thus
a
fathers
blessing
is
more
precious
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
victor
fougas
the
infidelity
of
clementine
pichon
touched
his
amourpropre
a
little
but
he
soon
consoled
himself
for
it
at
least
thought
he
ill
not
have
to
marry
an
old
woman
when
theres
a
young
one
waiting
for
me
at
fontainebleau
and
moreover
my
son
has
a
name
and
a
very
presentable
name
fougas
would
be
a
great
deal
better
but
langevin
is
not
bad
he
arrived
on
the
d
of
september
at
six
oclock
in
the
evening
at
that
large
and
beautiful
but
somewhat
stupid
city
which
constitutes
the
versailles
of
lorraine
his
heart
was
beating
fit
to
burst
to
recuperate
his
energies
he
took
a
good
dinner
the
landlord
when
catechized
at
dessert
gave
him
the
very
best
accounts
of
m
victor
langevin
a
man
still
young
married
for
the
past
six
years
father
of
a
boy
and
a
girl
respected
in
the
neighborhood
and
prosperous
in
his
affairs
i
was
sure
of
it
said
fougas
he
poured
down
a
bumper
of
a
certain
kirschwasser
from
the
black
forest
which
he
fancied
delicious
with
his
maccaroni
the
same
evening
m
langevin
related
to
his
wife
how
on
returning
from
the
club
at
ten
oclock
he
had
been
brutally
accosted
by
a
drunken
man
he
at
first
took
him
for
a
robber
and
prepared
to
defend
himself
but
the
man
contented
himself
with
embracing
him
and
then
ran
away
with
all
his
might
this
singular
accident
threw
the
two
spouses
into
a
series
of
conjectures
each
less
probable
than
the
preceding
but
as
they
were
both
young
and
had
been
married
barely
seven
years
they
soon
changed
the
subject
the
next
morning
fougas
laden
down
like
a
millers
ass
with
bonbons
presented
himself
at
m
langevins
in
order
to
make
himself
welcome
to
his
two
grandchildren
he
had
skimmed
the
shop
of
the
celebrated
lebèguethe
boissier
of
nancy
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
for
him
asked
if
he
were
the
gentleman
her
master
expected
good
said
he
my
letter

come

morning
and
your

it
at
the
hotel

this
hundred
franc

the
dining
room
if
i
want
to
open
the
door
right
away
he
discovered
that
the
little
boy
resembled
him
and
was
overjoyed
to
see
him
in
the
dress
of
an
artillerist
playing
with
a
sabre
his
pockets
were
soon
emptied
on
the
floor
and
the
two
children
at
the
sight
of
so
many
good
things
hung
about
his
neck
o
philosophers
cried
the
colonel
do
you
dare
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
voice
of
nature
a
pretty
little
lady
all
the
young
women
are
pretty
in
nancy
ran
in
at
the
joyous
cries
of
the
little
brood
my
daughterinlaw
cried
fougas
opening
his
arms
the
lady
of
the
house
modestly
recoiled
and
said
with
a
slight
smile
you
are
mistaken
sir
i
am
not
your
daughterinlaw
i
am
madame
langevin
what
a
fool
i
am
thought
the
colonel
here
i
was
going
to
tell
our
family
secrets
before
these
children
mind
your
manners
fougas
you
are
in
fine
society
where
the
ardor
of
the
sweetest
sentiments
is
hidden
under
the
icy
mask
of
indifference
be
seated
said
mme
langevin
i
hope
that
you
have
had
a
pleasant
journey
yes
madame
only
steam
seemed
too
slow
for
me
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
here
you
did
not
then
appreciate
that
i
was
fairly
burning
to
be
with
you
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
it
is
a
proof
that
reason
and
family
affection
have
made
themselves
heard
at
last
was
it
my
fault
that
family
ties
did
not
speak
effectually
sooner
well
after
all
the
main
thing
is
that
you
have
listened
to
them
we
will
exert
ourselves
to
prevent
your
finding
nancy
uninteresting
how
could
i
since
i
am
to
live
with
you
thank
you
our
house
will
be
yours
try
to
imagine
yourself
entirely
at
home
in
imagination
and
affection
too
madame
and
youll
not
think
of
paris
again
paris
i
dont
care
any
more
for
it
than
i
do
for
doomsday
i
forewarn
you
that
people
are
not
in
the
habit
of
fighting
duels
here
what
you
know
already
we
know
all
about
it
even
to
the
history
of
that
famous
supper
with
those
rather
volatile
ladies
how
the
devil
did
you
hear
of
that
but
that
time
believe
me
i
was
very
excusable
m
langevin
here
made
his
appearance
freshly
shaven
and
rubicunda
fine
specimen
of
the
subprefect
in
embryo
its
wonderful
thought
fougas
how

tough
subject

be
wiser
in
future

are
welcome
young
man
said
the
counsellor
offering
his
hand
to
fougas
this
reception
appeared
cold
to
our
poor
hero
he
had
been
dreaming
of
a
shower
of
kisses
and
tears
and
here
his
children
contented
themselves
with
offering
their
hands
my
chi
monsieur
said
he
to
langevin
there
is
one
person
still
needed
to
complete
our
reunion
a
few
mutual
wrongs
and
those
smoothed
over
by
time
ought
not
to
build
an
insurmountable
barrier
between
us
may
i
venture
to
request
the
favor
of
being
presented
to
your
mother
m
langevin
and
his
wife
opened
their
eyes
in
astonishment
how
monsieur
said
the
husband
paris

must
have
affected
your
memory
my
poor
mother

no
more

now

years
since

into
tears

who

been
cutting
up
didoes
in
the
capital
and

been
sent
to
nancy
to
go
through
the
agricultural
school
the
colonel
answered
with
the
voice
of
jupiter
tonans
i
am
fougas
very
well
if
nature
says
nothing
to
you
in
my
behalf
ungrateful
son
question
the
spirit
of
your
mother
upon
my
soul
sir
cried
the
counsellor
we
can
play
at
cross
purposes
a
good
while
sit
down
there
if
you
please
and
tell
me
your
businessmarie
take
away
the
children
fougas
did
not
require
any
urging
he
detailed
the
romance
of
his
life
without
omitting
anything
but
with
many
delicate
touches
for
the
filial
ears
of
m
langevin
the
counsellor
heard
him
patiently
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
disinterestedness
monsieur
said
he
at
last
at
first
i
took
you
for
a
madman
but
now
i
remember
that
the
newspapers
have
contained
some
scraps
of
your
history
and
i
see
that
you
are
the
victim
of
a
mistake
i
am
not
fortysix
years
old
but
thirtyfour
my
mothers
name
was
not
clementine
pichon
but
marie
herval
she
was
not
born
at
nancy
but
at
vannes
and
she
was
but
seven
years
old
in
nevertheless
i
am
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
ah
youre
not
my
son
replied
fougas
angrily
very
well
so
much
the
worse
for
you
no
one
seems
to
want
a
father
of
the
name
of
fougas
as
for
sons
by
the
name
of
langevin
one
only
has
to
stoop
to
pick
them
up
i
know
where
to
find
one
who
is
not
a
counsellor
of
the
prefecture
it
is
true
and
who
does
not
put
on
a
laced
coat
to
go
to
mass
but
who
has
an
honest
and
simple
heart
and
is
named
pierre
just
like
me
but
i
beg
your
pardon
when
one
shows
gentlemen
the
door
one
ought
at
least
to
return
what
belongs
to
them
i
dont
prevent
your
collecting
the
bonbons
which
my
children
have
scattered
over
the
floor
yes
im
talking
about
bonbons
with
a
vengeance
my
million
sir
what
million
your
brothers
million
no
the
million
that
belongs
to
him
who
is
not
your
brotherto
clementines
son
my
dear
and
only
child
the
only
scion
of
my
race
pierre
langevin
called
pierrot
a
miller
at
vergaville
but
i
assure
you
monsieur
that
i
havent
your
million
or
anybodys
else
you
dare
to
deny
it
scoundrel
when
i
sent
it
to
you
by
mail
myself
possibly
you
sent
it
but
i
certainly
have
not
received
it
aha
defend
yourself
he
made
at
his
throat
and
perhaps
france
would
have
lost
a
counsellor
of
prefecture
that
day
if
the
servant
had
not
come
in
with
two
letters
in
her
hand
fougas
recognized
his
own
handwriting
and
the
berlin
postmark
tore
open
the
envelope
and
displayed
the
check
here
said
he
is
the
million
i
intended
for
you
if
you
had
seen
fit
to
be
my
son
now
its
too
late
for
you
to
retract
the
voice
of
nature
calls
me
to
vergaville
your
servant
sir
on
the
th
of
september
pierre
langevin
miller
at
vergaville
celebrated
the
marriage
of
cadet
langevin
his
second
son
the
millers
family
was
numerous
respectable
and
in
comfortable
circumstances
first
there
was
the
grandfather
a
fine
hale
old
man
who
took
his
four
meals
a
day
and
doctored
his
little
ailings
with
the
wine
of
bar
or
thiaucourt
the
grandmother
catharine
had
been
pretty
in
her
day
and
a
little
frivolous
but
she
expiated
by
absolute
deafness
the
crime
of
having
listened
too
tenderly
to
gallants
m
pierre
langevin
alias
pierrot
alias
big
peter
after
having
sought
his
fortune
in
america
a
custom
becoming
quite
general
in
the
rural
districts
had
returned
to
the
village
in
pretty
much
the
condition
of
the
infant
saint
john
and
god
only
knows
how
many
jokes
were
perpetrated
over
his
ill
luck
the
people
of
lorraine
are
terrible
wags
and
if
you
are
not
fond
of
personal
jokes
i
advise
you
not
to
travel
in
their
neighborhood
big
peter
stung
to
the
quick
and
half
crazed
at
having
run
through
his
inheritance
borrowed
money
at
ten
per
cent
bought
the
mill
at
vergaville
worked
like
a
ploughhorse
in
heavy
land
and
repaid
his
capital
and
the
interest
fortune
who
owed
him
some
compensations
gave
him
gratis
pro
deo
a
half
dozen
superb
workerssix
big
boys
whom
his
wife
presented
him
with
one
annually
as
regularly
as
clockwork
every
year
nine
months
to
a
day
after
the
fête
of
vergaville
claudine
otherwise
known
as
glaudine
presented
one
for
baptism
at
last
she
died
after
the
sixth
from
eating
four
huge
pieces
of
quiche
before
her
churching
big
peter
did
not
marry
again
having
concluded
that
he
had
workers
enough
and
he
continued
to
add
to
his
fortune
nicely
but
as
standing
jokes
last
a
long
time
in
villages
the
millers
comrades
still
spoke
to
him
about
those
famous
millions
which
he
did
not
bring
back
from
america
and
big
peter
grew
very
red
under
his
flour
just
as
he
used
to
in
his
earlier
days
on
the
th
of
september
then
he
married
his
second
son
to
a
good
big
woman
of
altroff
who
had
fat
and
blazing
cheeks
this
being
a
kind
of
beauty
much
affected
in
the
country
the
wedding
took
place
at
the
mill
because
the
bride
was
orphaned
of
father
and
mother
and
had
previously
lived
with
the
nuns
of
molsheim
a
messenger
came
and
told
pierre
langevin
that
a
gentleman
wearing
decorations
had
something
to
say
to
him
and
fougas
appeared
in
all
his
glory
my
good
sir
said
the
miller
i
am
far
from
being
in
a
mood
to
talk
business
as
we
just
took
a
good
pull
at
white
wine
before
mass
but
we
are
going
to
drink
some
red
wine
thats
by
no
means
bad
at
dinner
and
if
your
heart
prompts
you
dont
be
backward
the
table
is
a
long
one
we
can
talk
afterwards
you
dont
say
no
then
thats
yes
for
once
thought
fougas
i
am
not
mistaken
this
is
surely
the
voice
of
nature
i
would
have
liked
a
soldier
better
but
this
genial
rustic
so
comfortably
rounded
satisfies
my
heart
i
cannot
be
indebted
to
him
for
many
gratifications
of
my
pride
but
never
mind
i
am
sure
of
his
goodwill
dinner
was
served
and
the
table
more
heavily
laden
with
viands
than
the
stomach
of
gargantua
big
peter
as
proud
of
his
big
family
as
of
his
little
fortune
made
the
colonel
stand
by
as
he
enumerated
his
children
and
fougas
was
joyful
at
learning
that
he
had
six
welcome
grandchildren
he
was
seated
at
the
right
of
a
little
stunted
old
woman
who
was
presented
to
him
as
the
grandmother
of
the
youngsters
heavens
how
changed
clementine
appeared
to
him
save
the
eyes
which
were
still
lively
and
sparkling
there
was
no
longer
anything
about
her
that
could
be
recognized
see
thought
fougas
what
i
would
have
been
like
today
if
the
worthy
john
meiser
had
not
desiccated
me
he
smiled
to
himself
on
regarding
grandfather
langevin
the
reputed
progenitor
of
this
numerous
family
poor
old
fellow
murmured
fougas
you
little
think
what
you
owe
to
me
they
dine
boisterously
at
village
weddings
this
is
an
abuse
which
i
sincerely
hope
civilization
will
never
reform
under
cover
of
the
noise
fougas
entered
into
conversation
or
thought
he
did
with
his
lefthand
neighbor
clementine
he
said
to
her
she
raised
her
eyes
and
her
nose
too
and
responded
yes
monsieur
my
heart
has
not
deceived
me
thenyou
are
indeed
my
clementine
yes
monsieur
and
you
have
recognized
me
noble
and
excellent
woman
yes
monsieur
but
how
did
you
conceal
your
emotion
so
well
how
strong
women
are
i
fall
from
the
skies
into
the
midst
of
your
peaceful
existence
and
you
see
me
without
moving
a
muscle
yes
monsieur
have
you
forgiven
me
for
a
seeming
injury
for
which
destiny
alone
is
responsible
yes
monsieur
thanks
a
thousand
thanks
what
a
charming
family
you
have
about
you
this
good
pierre
who
almost
opened
his
arms
on
seeing
me
approach
is
my
son
is
he
not
yes
monsieur
rejoice
he
shall
be
rich
he
already
has
happiness
i
bring
him
fortune
his
portion
shall
be
a
million
oh
clementine
what
a
commotion
there
will
be
in
this
simple
assembly
when
i
raise
my
voice
and
say
to
my
son
here
this
million
is
for
you
is
it
a
good
time
now
shall
i
speak
shall
i
tell
all
yes
monsieur
fougas
immediately
arose
and
requested
silence
the
people
thought
he
was
going
to
sing
a
song
and
all
kept
quiet
pierre
langevin
said
he
with
emphasis
i
have
come
back
from
the
other
world
and
brought
you
a
million
if
big
peter
did
not
want
to
get
angry
he
at
least
got
red
and
the
joke
seemed
to
him
in
bad
taste
but
when
fougas
announced
that
he
had
loved
the
grandmother
in
her
youth
grandfather
langevin
no
longer
hesitated
to
fling
a
bottle
at
his
head
the
colonels
son
his
splendid
grandchildren
and
even
the
bride
all
jumped
up
in
high
dudgeon
and
there
was
a
very
pretty
scrimmage
indeed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
fougas
did
not
get
the
upper
hand
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
injure
some
of
his
family
paternal
affection
robbed
him
of
three
quarters
of
his
power
but
having
learned
during
the
clamor
that
clementine
was
called
catharine
and
that
pierre
langevin
was
born
in
he
resumed
the
offensive
blacked
three
eyes
broke
an
arm
mashed
two
noses
knocked
in
four
dozen
teeth
and
regained
his
carriage
with
all
the
honors
of
war
devil
take
the
children
said
he
while
riding
in
a
postchaise
toward
the
avricourt
station
if
i
have
a
son
i
wish
he
may
find
me
chapter
xix
he
seeks
and
bestows
the
hand
of
clementine
on
the
fifth
of
september
at
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
leon
renault
emaciated
dejected
and
scarcely
recognizable
was
at
the
feet
of
clementine
sambucco
in
her
aunts
parlor
there
were
flowers
on
the
mantel
and
flowers
in
all
the
vases
two
great
burglar
sunbeams
broke
through
the
open
windows
a
million
of
little
bluish
atoms
were
playing
in
the
light
crossing
each
other
and
getting
fantastically
mixed
up
like
the
ideas
in
a
volume
of
m
alfred
houssaye
in
the
garden
the
apples
were
falling
the
peaches
were
ripe
the
hornets
were
ploughing
broad
deep
furrows
in
the
duchesse
pears
the
trumpetflowers
and
clematisvines
were
in
blossom
and
to
crown
all
a
great
mass
of
heliotropes
trained
over
the
left
window
was
flourishing
in
all
its
beauty
the
sun
had
given
all
the
grapes
in
the
arbor
a
tint
of
golden
bronze
and
the
great
yucca
on
the
lawn
shaken
by
the
wind
like
a
chinese
hat
noiselessly
clashed
its
silver
bells
but
the
son
of
m
renault
was
more
pale
and
haggard
than
the
white
lilac
sprays
more
blighted
than
the
leaves
on
the
old
cherrytree
his
heart
was
without
joy
and
without
hope
like
the
currant
bushes
without
leaves
and
without
fruit
to
be
exiled
from
his
native
land
to
have
lived
three
years
in
an
inhospitable
climate
to
have
passed
so
many
days
in
deep
mines
so
many
nights
over
an
earthenware
stove
in
the
midst
of
an
infinity
of
bugs
and
a
multiplicity
of
serfs
and
to
see
himself
set
aside
for
a
twentyfivelouis
colonel
whom
he
himself
had
brought
to
life
by
soaking
him
in
water
all
men
are
subject
to
disappointments
but
surely
never
had
one
encountered
a
misfortune
so
unforeseen
and
so
extraordinary
leon
knew
that
earth
is
not
a
valley
flowing
with
chocolate
and
soup
à
la
reine
he
knew
the
list
of
the
renowned
unfortunates
beginning
with
abel
slain
in
the
garden
of
paradise
and
ending
with
rubens
assassinated
in
the
gallery
of
the
louvre
at
paris
but
history
which
seldom
instructs
us
never
consoles
us
the
poor
engineer
in
vain
repeated
to
himself
that
a
thousand
others
had
been
supplanted
on
the
day
before
marriage
and
a
hundred
thousand
on
the
day
after
melancholy
was
stronger
than
reason
and
three
or
four
soft
locks
were
beginning
to
whiten
about
his
temples
clementine
said
he
i
am
the
most
miserable
of
men
in
refusing
me
the
hand
which
you
have
promised
you
condemn
me
to
agony
a
hundred
times
worse
than
death
alas
what
would
you
have
me
become
without
you
i
must
live
alone
for
i
love
you
too
well
to
marry
another
for
four
long
years
all
my
affections
all
my
thoughts
have
been
centred
upon
you
i
have
become
accustomed
to
regard
other
women
as
inferior
beings
unworthy
of
attracting
the
interest
of
a
man
i
will
not
speak
to
you
of
the
efforts
i
have
made
to
deserve
you
they
brought
their
reward
in
themselves
and
i
was
already
too
happy
in
working
and
suffering
for
you
but
see
the
misery
in
which
your
desertion
has
left
me
a
sailor
thrown
upon
a
desert
island
has
less
to
deplore
than
i
i
will
be
forced
to
live
near
you
to
witness
the
happiness
of
another
to
see
you
pass
my
windows
upon
the
arm
of
my
rival
ah
death
would
be
more
endurable
than
this
constant
agony
but
i
have
not
even
the
right
to
die
my
poor
old
parents
have
already
sorrows
enough
what
would
it
be
great
god
if
i
were
to
condemn
them
to
bear
the
loss
of
their
son
this
complaint
punctuated
with
sighs
and
tears
lacerated
the
heart
of
clementine
the
poor
child
wept
too
for
she
loved
leon
with
her
whole
soul
but
she
was
interdicted
from
telling
him
so
more
than
once
on
seeing
him
half
dying
before
her
she
felt
tempted
to
throw
her
arms
about
his
neck
but
the
recollection
of
fougas
paralyzed
all
her
tender
impulses
my
poor
friend
said
she
you
judge
me
very
wrongfully
if
you
think
me
insensible
to
your
sufferings
i
have
known
you
thoroughly
leon
and
that
too
since
my
very
childhood
i
know
all
that
there
is
in
you
of
devotion
delicacy
and
precious
and
noble
virtues
since
the
time
when
you
carried
me
in
your
arms
to
the
poor
and
put
a
penny
in
my
hand
to
teach
me
to
give
alms
i
have
never
heard
benevolence
spoken
of
without
involuntarily
thinking
of
you
when
you
whipped
a
boy
twice
your
size
for
taking
away
my
doll
i
felt
that
courage
was
noble
and
that
a
woman
would
be
happy
in
being
able
to
lean
on
a
brave
man
all
that
i
have
ever
seen
you
do
since
that
time
has
only
redoubled
my
esteem
and
my
sympathy
believe
me
that
it
is
neither
from
wickedness
or
ingratitude
that
i
make
you
suffer
now
alas
i
no
longer
belong
to
myself
i
am
under
external
control
i
am
like
those
automatons
that
move
without
knowing
why
yes
i
feel
an
impulse
within
me
more
powerful
than
my
self
control
and
it
is
the
will
of
another
that
leads
me
if
i
could
but
be
sure
that
you
will
be
happy
but
no
this
man
before
whom
you
immolate
me
will
never
know
the
worth
of
a
soul
as
delicate
as
yours
he
is
a
brute
a
swashbuckler
a
drunkard
i
beseech
you
leon
remember
that
he
has
a
right
to
my
unreserved
respect
respect
for
him
and
why
i
ask
of
you
in
heavens
name
what
you
find
respectable
in
the
character
of
mister
fougas
his
age
he
is
younger
than
i
his
talents
he
never
shows
them
anywhere
but
at
the
table
his
education
its
lovely
his
virtues
i
know
what
is
to
be
thought
of
his
refinement
and
gratitude
i
have
respected
him
leon
since
i
first
saw
him
in
his
coffin
it
is
a
sentiment
stronger
than
all
else
i
cannot
explain
it
i
can
but
submit
to
it
very
well
respect
him
as
much
as
you
please
yield
to
the
superstition
that
enchains
you
see
in
him
a
miraculous
being
consecrated
rescued
from
the
grip
of
death
to
accomplish
something
great
on
earth
but
this
itself
oh
my
dear
clementine
is
a
barrier
between
you
and
him
if
fougas
is
outside
of
the
conditions
of
humanity
if
he
is
a
phenomenon
a
being
apart
a
hero
a
demigod
a
fetich
you
cannot
seriously
think
of
becoming
his
wife
as
for
me
i
am
but
a
man
like
others
born
to
work
to
suffer
and
to
love
i
love
you
love
me
scoundrel
cried
fougas
opening
the
door
clementine
uttered
a
cry
leon
sprung
up
quickly
but
the
colonel
had
already
seized
him
by
the
most
practicable
part
of
his
nankeen
suit
before
he
had
even
time
to
think
of
a
single
word
in
reply
the
engineer
was
lifted
up
balanced
like
an
atom
in
one
of
the
sunbeams
and
flung
into
the
very
midst
of
the
heliotropes
poor
leon
poor
heliotropes
in
less
than
a
second
the
young
man
was
on
his
feet
he
dusted
the
earth
from
his
knees
and
elbows
approached
the
window
and
said
in
a
calm
but
resolute
voice
mister
colonel
i
sincerely
regret
having
brought
you
back
to
life
but
possibly
the
folly
of
which
i
have
been
guilty
is
not
irreparable
i
hope
soon
to
have
an
opportunity
to
find
out
if
it
be
as
for
you
mademoiselle
i
love
you
the
colonel
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
put
himself
at
the
young
girls
feet
on
the
very
cushion
which
still
bore
the
impression
left
by
leon
mlle
virginie
sambucco
attracted
by
the
noise
came
down
stairs
like
an
avalanche
and
heard
the
following
conversation
idol
of
a
great
soul
fougas
returns
to
thee
like
the
eagle
to
his
eyrie
i
have
long
traversed
the
world
in
pursuit
of
rank
fortune
and
family
which
i
was
burning
to
lay
at
thy
feet
fortune
has
obeyed
me
as
a
slave
she
knows
in
what
school
i
learned
the
art
of
controlling
her
i
have
gone
through
paris
and
germany
like
a
victorious
meteor
led
by
its
star
i
have
everywhere
associated
as
an
equal
with
the
powers
of
earth
and
made
the
trumpet
of
truth
resound
in
the
halls
of
kings
i
have
put
my
foot
on
the
throat
of
greedy
avarice
and
snatched
from
him
a
part
at
least
of
the
treasures
which
he
had
stolen
from
tooconfiding
honor
one
only
blessing
is
denied
me
the
son
i
hoped
to
see
has
escaped
the
lynxeyes
of
paternal
love
neither
have
i
found
the
ancient
object
of
my
first
affections
but
what
matters
it
i
shall
feel
the
want
of
nothing
if
you
fill
for
me
the
place
of
all
what
do
we
wait
for
now
are
you
deaf
to
the
voice
of
happiness
which
calls
you
let
us
go
to
the
temple
of
the
laws
then
you
shall
follow
me
to
the
foot
of
the
altar
a
priest
shall
consecrate
our
bonds
and
we
will
go
through
life
leaning
on
one
another
i
like
the
oak
sustaining
weakness
thou
like
the
graceful
ivy
ornamenting
the
emblem
of
strength
clementine
remained
a
few
moments
without
answering
as
if
stunned
by
the
colonels
vehement
rhetoric
monsieur
fougas
she
said
to
him
i
have
always
obeyed
you
i
promise
to
obey
you
all
my
life
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
marry
poor
leon
i
will
renounce
him
i
love
him
devotedly
nevertheless
and
a
single
word
from
him
arouses
more
emotion
in
my
heart
than
all
the
fine
things
you
have
said
to
me
good
very
good
cried
the
aunt
as
for
me
sir
although
you
have
never
done
me
the
honor
to
consult
me
i
will
tell
you
my
opinion
my
niece
is
not
at
all
the
woman
to
suit
you
were
you
richer
than
m
de
rothschild
and
more
illustrious
than
the
duke
of
malakoff
i
would
not
advise
clementine
to
marry
you
and
why
chaste
minerva
because
you
would
love
her
fifteen
days
and
then
at
the
first
sound
of
cannon
be
off
to
the
wars
you
would
abandon
her
sir
just
as
you
did
that
unhappy
clementine
whose
misfortunes
have
been
recounted
to
us
zounds
lady
aunt

do
advise
you

bestow
your
pity
on
her
three
months

at
nancy

and

these
attacks
one
would
suppose
that
the
poor
old
girl
had
lost
her
head
but
virginie
sambucco
had
already
opened
a
little
rosewood
secretary
her
unerring
glance

in
a
file
of

a
sheet
yellow
with

how
do
you
happen
to
have
my
family
papers
poor
clementine
and
you
accuse
her
of
unfaithfulness
you
do
not
understand
then
that
you
had
been
taken
for
dead
that
she
supposed
herself
a
widow
without
having
been
a
wife
that
its
all
right
its
all
right
i
forgive
her
where
is
she
i
want
to
see
her
to
embrace
her
to
tell
her
she

dead
monsieur
she

three
months
after
she
was
married

the
resemblance
but
then
i
cant
marry
her
never
mind
clementine
come
to
my
arms
embrace
your
grandfather
the
poor
child
had
not
been
able
entirely
to
comprehend
this
rapid
conversation
from
which
events
had
been
falling
like
tiles
upon
the
head
of
the
colonel
she
had
always
heard
m
langevin
spoken
of
as
her
maternal
grandfather
and
now
she
seemed
to
hear
that
her
mother
was
the
daughter
of
fougas
but
she
knew
at
the
first
words
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
to
marry
the
colonel
and
that
she
would
soon
be
married
to
leon
renault
it
was
therefore
from
an
impulse
of
joy
and
gratitude
that
she
flung
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
youngold
man
ah
monsieur
said
she
i
have
always
loved
and
respected
you
like
a
grandfather

poor

like
an
old
beast
all
men
are
brutes
and
all
women
are
angels
you
divined
with
the
delicate
instinct
of
your
sex
that
you
owed
me
respect
and
i
fool
that
i
am
didnt
divine
anything

all
whew
without
the
venerable
aunt
there
id
have
made
a
pretty
piece
of

the
truth
in
going
over
our
family
papers

since

fougas
gave
her
a
twirl
on
her
feet
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
engineer
leon
had
heard
the
sound
of
a
quarrel
and
on
seeing
the
colonel
excited
with
flashing
eyes
he
expected
some
brutal
aggression
and
did
not
wait
for
the
first
blow
a
struggle
took
place
in
the
passage
amid
the
cries
of
gothon
m
renault
and
the
poor
old
lady
who
was
screaming
murder
leon
wrestled
kicked
and
from
time
to
time
launched
a
vigorous
blow
into
the
body
of
his
antagonist
he
had
to
succumb
nevertheless
the
colonel
finished
by
upsetting
him
on
the
ground
and
holding
him
there
then
he
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
and
said
to
him
ah
you
naughty
boy
now
im
pretty
sure
to
make
you
listen
to
me
i
am
clementines
grandfather

parricide
mlle
sambucco
and
clementine
arrived
in
the
midst
of
the
general
stupefaction
they
completed
the
recital
of
fougas
who
had
gotten
himself
pretty
badly
mixed
up
in
the
genealogy
leons

appeared
in
their
turn
they
had
not
found
the

in

hotel
where
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
and
came
to
give
an
account
of
their
mission
a
tableau
of
perfect
happiness

their
astonished
gaze

invited
them

mlle

has
the
honor
to
announce
to
you
the
marriage
of

her
niece

the

the

their

to

and
invite
you
to
be
present
at
the
nuptial
benediction
which
will
be
given
them
on
the
th
of
september
in
the
church
of
saint
maxcence
in
their
parish
at
eleven
oclock
precisely
fougas
absolutely
insisted
that
his
name
should
figure
on
the
cards
they
had
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
cure
him
of
this
whim
mme
renault
lectured
him
two
full
hours
she
told
him
that
in
the
eyes
of
society
as
well
as
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
clementine
was
the
granddaughter
of
m
langevin
that
moreover
m
langevin
had
acted
very
liberally
in
legitimizing
by
marriage
a
daughter
that
was
not
his
own
finally
that
the
publication
of
such
a
family
secret
would
be
an
outrage
against
the
sanctity
of
the
grave
and
would
tarnish
the
memory
of
poor
clementine
pichon
the
colonel
answered
with
the
warmth
of
a
young
man
and
the
obstinacy
of
an
old
one
nature
has
her
rights
they
are
anterior
to
the
conventions
of
society
and
a
thousand
times
more
exalted
the
honor
of
her
i
called
my
ægle
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
treasures
of
the
world
and
i
would
cleave
the
soul
of
any
rash
being
who
should
attempt
to
tarnish
it
in
yielding
to
the
ardor
of
my
vows
she
but
conformed
to
the
custom
of
a
great
epoch
when
the
uncertainty
of
life
and
the
constant
existence
of
war
simplified
all
formalities
and
in
conclusion
i
do
not
wish
that
my
grandchildren
yet
to
be
born
should
be
ignorant
that
the
source
of
their
blood
is
in
the
veins
of
fougas
your
langevin
is
but
an
intruder
who
covertly
slipped
into
my
family
a
commissary
its
almost
a
sutler
i
spurn
under
foot
the
ashes
of
langevin
his
obstinacy
would
not
yield
to
the
arguments
of
mme
renault
but
it
succumbed
to
the
entreaties
of
clementine
the
young
creole
twisted
him
around
her
finger
with
irresistible
grace
my
good
grandpa
this
my
pretty
little
grandpa
that
my
old
baby
of
a
grandpa
well
send
you
off
to
college
if
youre
not
reasonable
she
used
to
seat
herself
familiarly
on
fougas
knee
and
give
him
little
love
pats
on
the
cheeks
the
colonel
would
assume
the
gruffest
possible
voice
and
then
his
heart
would
overflow
with
tenderness
and
he
would
cry
like
a
child
these
familiarities
added
nothing
to
the
happiness
of
leon
renault
i
even
think
that
they
slightly
tempered
his
joy
yet
he
certainly
did
not
doubt
either
the
love
of
his
betrothed
or
the
honor
of
fougas
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
between
a
grandfather
and
his
granddaughter
such
little
liberties
are
natural
and
proper
and
could
justly
offend
no
one
but
the
situation
was
so
new
and
so
unusual
that
he
needed
a
little
time
to
adapt
his
feelings
to
it
and
forget
his
chagrin
this
grandfather
for
whom
he
had
paid
fivehundred
francs
whose
ear
he
had
broken
for
whom
he
had
bought
a
burialplace
in
the
fontainebleau
cemetery
this
ancestor
younger
than
himself
whom
he
had
seen
drunk
whom
he
had
found
agreeable
then
dangerous
then
insupportable
this
venerable
head
of
the
family
who
had
begun
by
demanding
clementines
hand
and
ended
by
pitching
his
future
grandson
into
the
heliotropes
could
not
all
at
once
obtain
unmingled
respect
and
unreserved
affection
m
and
mme
renault
exhorted
their
son
to
submission
and
deference
they
represented
m
fougas
to
him
as
a
relative
who
ought
to
be
treated
with
consideration
a
few
days
of
patience
said
the
good
mother
he
will
not
stay
with
us
long
he
is
a
soldier
and
cant
live
out
of
the
army
any
better
than
a
fish
out
of
water
but
leons
parents
in
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
held
a
bitter
remembrance
of
so
many
pangs
and
mortifications
fougas
had
been
the
scourge
of
the
family
the
wounds
which
he
had
made
could
not
heal
over
in
a
day
even
gothon
bore
him
ill
will
without
confessing
it
she
heaved
great
sighs
while
preparing
for
the
wedding
festivities
at
mlle
sambuccos
ah
my
poor
célestin
said
she
to
her
acolyte
what
a
little
rascal
of
a
grandfather
were
going
to
have
to
be
sure
the
only
person
who
was
perfectly
at
ease
was
fougas
he
had
passed
the
sponge
over
his
pranks
out
of
all
the
evil
he
had
done
he
retained
no
ill
will
against
any
one
very
paternal
with
clementine
very
gracious
with
m
and
mme
renault
he
evinced
for
leon
the
most
frank
and
cordial
friendship
my
dear
boy
said
he
to
him
i
have
studied
you
i
know
you
and
i
love
you
thoroughly
you
deserve
to
be
happy
and
you
shall
be
you
shall
soon
see
that
in
buying
me
for
twentyfive
napoleons
you
didnt
make
a
bad
bargain
if
gratitude
were
banished
from
the
universe
it
would
find
a
last
abiding
place
in
the
heart
of
fougas
three
days
before
the
marriage
m
bonnivet
informed
the
family
that
the
colonel
had
come
into
his
office
to
ask
for
a
conference
about
the
contract
he
had
scarcely
cast
his
eyes
on
the
sheet
of
stamped
paper
when
rrrrip
it
was
in
pieces
in
the
fireplace
mister
notescratcher
he
said
do
me
the
honor
of
beginning
your
chefdoeuvre
over
again
the
granddaughter
of
fougas
does
not
marry
with
an
annuity
of
eight
thousand
francs
nature
and
friendship
give
her
a
million
here
it
is
thereupon
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
bank
check
for
a
million
paced
the
study
proudly
making
his
boots
creak
and
threw
a
thousandfranc
note
on
a
clerks
desk
crying
in
his
clearest
tones
children
of
the
law
heres
something
to
drink
the
health
of
the
emperor
and
the
grand
army
with
the
renault
family
strongly
remonstrated
against
this
liberality
clementine
on
being
told
of
it
by
her
intended
had
a
long
discussion
in
the
presence
of
mlle
sambucco
with
the
young
and
terrible
grandpapa
she
tried
to
impress
upon
him
that
he
was
but
twentyfour
years
old
that
he
would
be
getting
married
some
day
and
that
his
property
belonged
to
his
future
family
i
do
not
wish
said
she
that
your
children
should
accuse
me
of
having
robbed
them
keep
your
millions
for
my
little
uncles
and
aunts
but
for
once
fougas
would
not
yield
an
inch
are
you
mocking
me
he
said
to
clementine
do
you
think
that
i
will
be
guilty
of
the
folly
of
marrying
now
i
do
not
promise
you
to
live
like
a
monk
of
la
trappe
but
at
my
age
a
man
put
together
like
i
am
can
find
enough
to
talk
to
around
the
garrisons
without
marrying
anybody
mars
does
not
borrow
the
torch
of
hymen
to
light
the
little
aberrations
of
venus
why
does
man
ever
tie
himself
in
matrimonial
bonds
for
the
sake
of
being
a
father
i
am
one
already
in
the
comparative
degree
and
in
a
year
if
our
brave
leon
does
a
mans
part
i
shall
assume
the
superlative
greatgrandfather
thats
a
lovely
position
for
a
trooper
twentyfive
years
old
at
fortyfive
or
fifty
i
shall
be
greatgreatgrandfather
at
seventy
the
french
language
has
no
more
words
to
express
what
i
shall
become
but
we
can
order
one
from
those
babblers
of
the
academy
are
you
afraid
that
ill
want
for
anything
in
my
old
age
i
have
my
pay
in
the
first
place
and
my
officers
cross
when
i
reach
the
years
of
anchises
or
nestor
i
will
have
my
haltpay
add
to
all
this
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
from
the
king
of
prussia
and
you
shall
see
that
i
have
not
only
bread
but
all
essential
fixings
in
the
bargain
up
to
the
close
of
my
career
moreover
i
have
a
perpetual
grant
for
which
your
husband
has
paid
in
advance
in
the
fontainebleau
cemetery
with
all
these
possessions
and
simple
tastes
one
is
sure
not
to
eat
up
ones
resources
willing
or
unwilling
they
had
to
concede
all
he
required
and
accept
his
million
this
act
of
generosity
made
a
great
commotion
in
the
town
and
the
name
of
fougas
already
celebrated
in
so
many
ways
acquired
a
new
prestige
the
signature
of
the
bride
was
attested
by
the
marshal
the
duke
of
solferino
and
the
illustrious
karl
nibor
who
but
a
few
days
before
had
been
elected
to
the
academy
of
sciences
leon
modestly
retained
the
old
friends
whom
he
had
long
since
chosen
m
audret
the
architect
and
m
bonnivet
the
notary
the
mayor
was
brilliant
in
his
new
scarf
the
curé
addressed
to
the
young
couple
an
affecting
allocution
on
the
inexhaustible
goodness
of
providence
which
still
occasionally
performs
a
miracle
for
the
benefit
of
true
christians
fougas
who
had
not
discharged
his
religious
duties
since
soaked
two
handkerchiefs
with
tears
one
must
always
part
from
those
nearest
the
heart
said
he
on
going
out
of
church
but
god
and
i
are
made
to
understand
each
other
after
all
what
is
god
but
a
little
more
universal
napoleon
a
pantagruelic
feast
presided
over
by
mlle
virginie
sambucco
in
a
dress
of
pucecolored
silk
followed
immediately
upon
the
marriage
ceremony
twentyfour
persons
were
present
at
this
family
fête
among
others
the
new
colonel
of
the
d
and
m
du
marnet
who
was
almost
well
of
his
wound
fougas
took
up
his
napkin
with
a
certain
anxiety
he
hoped
that
the
marshal
had
brought
his
brevet
as
brigadier
general
his
expressive
countenance
manifested
lively
disappointment
at
the
empty
plate
the
duke
of
solferino
who
had
been
seated
at
the
place
of
honor
noticed
this
physiognomical
display
and
said
aloud
dont
be
impatient
my
old
comrade
i
know
what
you
miss
it
was
not
my
fault
that
the
fête
was
not
complete
the
minister
of
war
was
out
when
i
dropped
in
on
my
way
here
i
was
told
however
at
the
department
that
your
affair
was
kept
in
suspense
by
a
technical
question
but
that
you
would
receive
a
letter
from
the
office
within
twentyfour
hours
devil
take
the
documents
cried
fougas
theyve
got
them
all
from
my
birthcertificate
down
to
the
copy
of
my
brevet
colonels
commission
youll
find
out
that
they
want
a
certificate
of
vaccination
or
some
such
sixpenny
shinplaster
oh
patience
young
man
youve
time
enough
to
wait
its
not
such
a
case
as
mine
without
the
italian
campaign
which
gave
me
a
chance
to
snatch
the
baton
they
would
have
slit
my
ear
like
a
condemned
horse
under
the
empty
pretext
that
i
was
sixtyfive
years
old
youre
not
yet
twentyfive
and
youre
on
the
point
of
becoming
a
brigadier
the
emperor
promised
it
to
you
before
me
in
four
or
five
years
from
now
youll
have
the
gold
stars
unless
some
bad
luck
interferes
after
which
youll
need
nothing
but
the
command
of
an
army
and
a
successful
campaign
to
make
you
marshal
of
france
and
senator
which
may
nothing
prevent
yes
responded
fougas
ill
reach
it
not
only
because
i
am
the
youngest
of
all
the
officers
of
my
grade
and
because
i
have
been
in
the
mightiest
of
wars
and
followed
the
lessons
of
the
master
of
bellonas
fields
but
above
all
because
destiny
has
marked
me
with
her
sign
why
did
the
bullets
spare
me
in
more
than
twenty
battles
why
have
i
sped
over
oceans
of
steel
and
fire
without
my
skin
receiving
a
scratch
it
is
because
i
have
a
star
as
he
had
his
was
the
grander
it
is
true
but
it
went
out
at
st
helena
while
mine
is
burning
in
heaven
still
if
doctor
nibor
resuscitated
me
with
a
few
drops
of
warm
water
it
was
because
my
destiny
was
not
yet
accomplished
if
the
will
of
the
french
people
has
reestablished
the
imperial
throne
it
was
to
furnish
me
a
series
of
opportunities
for
my
valor
during
the
conquest
of
europe
which
we
are
about
to
recommence
vive
lempereur
and
me
too
i
shall
be
duke
or
prince
in
less
than
ten
years
and
why
not
one
might
try
to
be
at
rollcall
on
the
day
when
crowns
are
distributed
in
that
case
i
will
adopt
clementines
oldest
son
we
will
call
him
pierre
victor
ii
and
he
shall
succeed
me
on
the
throne
just
as
louis
xv
succeeded
his
grandfather
louis
xiv
as
he
was
finishing
this
wonderful
speech
a
gendarme
entered
the
dining
room
asked
for
colonel
fougas
and
handed
him
a
letter
from
the
minister
of
war
gad
cried
the
marshal
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
your
promotion
arrive
at
the
end
of
such
a
discourse
for
once
we
would
prostrate
ourselves
before
your
star
the
magi
kings
would
be
nowhere
compared
with
us
read
it
yourself
said
he
to
the
marshal
holding
out
to
him
the
great
sheet
of
paper
but
no
i
have
always
looked
death
in
the
face
i
will
not
turn
my
eyes
away
from
this
paper
thunder
if
it
is
killing
me
colonel
in
preparing
the
imperial
decree
which
elevated
you
to
the
rank
of
brigadier
general
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
an
insurmountable
obstacle
viz
your
certificate
of
birth
it
appears
from
that
document
that
you
were
born
in
and
that
you
have
already
passed
your
seventieth
year
now
the
limit
of
age
being
fixed
at
sixty
years
for
colonels
sixtytwo
for
brigadier
generals
and
sixtyfive
for
generals
of
division
i
find
myself
under
the
absolute
necessity
of
placing
you
upon
the
retired
list
with
the
rank
of
colonel
i
know
monsieur
how
little
this
measure
is
justified
by
your
apparent
age
and
i
sincerely
regret
that
france
should
be
deprived
of
the
services
of
a
man
of
your
capacity
and
merit
moreover
it
is
certain
that
an
exception
in
your
favor
would
arouse
no
dissatisfaction
in
the
army
and
would
meet
with
nothing
but
sympathetic
approval
but
the
law
is
express
and
the
emperor
himself
cannot
violate
or
elude
it
the
impossibility
resulting
from
it
is
so
absolute
that
if
in
your
ardor
to
serve
the
country
you
were
willing
to
lay
aside
your
epaulettes
for
the
sake
of
beginning
upon
a
new
career
your
enlistment
could
not
be
received
in
a
single
regiment
of
the
army
it
is
fortunate
monsieur
that
the
emperors
government
has
been
able
to
furnish
you
the
means
of
subsistence
in
obtaining
from
his
royal
highness
the
regent
of
prussia
the
indemnity
which
was
due
you
for
there
is
not
even
an
office
in
the
civil
administration
in
which
even
by
special
favor
a
man
seventy
years
old
could
be
placed
you
will
very
justly
object
that
the
laws
and
regulations
now
in
force
date
from
a
period
when
experiments
on
the
revivification
of
men
had
not
yet
met
with
favorable
results
but
the
law
is
made
for
the
mass
of
mankind
and
cannot
take
any
account
of
exceptions
undoubtedly
attention
would
be
directed
to
its
amendment
if
cases
of
resuscitation
were
to
present
themselves
in
sufficient
number
accept
c
a
gloomy
silence
succeeded
the
reading
the
mene
mene
tekel
upharsin
of
the
oriental
legends
could
not
have
more
completely
produced
the
effect
of
thunderbolts
the
gendarme
was
still
there
standing
in
the
position
of
the
soldier
without
arms
awaiting
fougas
receipt
the
colonel
called
for
pen
and
ink
signed
the
paper
gave
the
gendarme
drinkmoney
and
said
to
him
with
illsuppressed
emotion
you
are
happy
you
are
no
one
prevents
you
from
serving
the
country
well
added
he
turning
toward
the
marshal
what
do
you
say
to
that
what
would
you
have
me
say
my
poor
old
boy
it
breaks
me
all
up
theres
no
use
in
arguing
against
the
law
its
express
the
stupid
thing
on
our
parts
was
not
to
think
of
it
sooner
but
who
the
devil
would
have
thought
of
the
retired
list
in
the
presence
of
such
a
fellow
as
you
are
the
two
colonels
avowed
that
such
an
objection
would
never
have
entered
their
heads
now
that
it
had
been
suggested
however
they
could
not
see
what
to
rebut
it
with
neither
of
them
would
have
been
able
to
enlist
fougas
as
a
private
soldier
despite
his
ability
his
physical
strength
and
his
appearance
of
being
twentyfour
years
old
if
some
one
would
only
kill
me
cried
fougas
i
cant
set
myself
to
weighing
sugar
or
planting
cabbages
it
was
in
the
career
of
arms
that
i
took
my
first
steps
i
must
continue
in
it
or
die
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
become
take
service
in
some
foreign
army
never
the
fate
of
moreau
is
still
before
my
eyes
oh
fortune
what
have
i
done
to
thee
that
i
should
be
dashed
so
low
when
thou
wast
preparing
to
raise
me
so
high
clementine
tried
to
console
him
with
soothing
words
you
shall
live
near
us
said
she
we
will
find
you
a
pretty
little
wife
and
you
can
rear
your
children
in
your
leisure
moments
you
can
write
the
history
of
the
great
deeds
you
have
done
you
will
want
for
nothing
youth
health
fortune
family
all
that
makes
up
the
happiness
of
men
is
yours
why
then
should
you
not
be
happy
leon
and
his
parents
talked
with
him
in
the
same
way
everything
appertaining
to
the
festive
occasion
was
forgotten
in
the
presence
of
an
affliction
so
real
and
a
dejection
so
profound
he
roused
himself
little
by
little
and
even
sang
at
dessert
a
little
song
which
he
had
prepared
for
the
occasion
heres
a
health
to
these
fortunate
lovers
who
on
this
thrice
blessed
day
have
singed
with
the
torch
of
chaste
hymen
the
wings
with
which
cupid
doth
stray
and
now
little
volatile
boygod
you
must
keep
yourself
quiet
at
home
enchained
there
by
this
happy
marriage
where
genius
and
beauty
are
one
hell
make
it
henceforth
his
endeavor
to
keep
pleasure
in
loyaltys
power
forgetting
his
naughty
old
habit
of
roaming
from
flower
to
flower
and
clementine
makes
the
task
easy
for
roses
spring
up
at
her
smile
from
thence
the
young
rascal
can
steal
them
as
well
as
in
venuss
isle
the
verses
were
loudly
applauded
but
the
poor
colonel
smiled
sadly
talked
but
little
and
did
not
get
fuddled
at
all
the
man
with
the
broken
ear
could
not
at
all
console
himself
for
having
a
slit
ear
he
took
part
in
the
various
diversions
of
the
day
but
was
no
longer
the
brilliant
companion
who
had
inspired
everything
with
his
impetuous
gayety

marshal
buttonholed
him
during
the
evening
and
said
what

of

old
messmates

their
faces

a
half
about
ten
oclock
in
the
evening
m
rollon

and
fougas
accompanied
the
marshal
to
the
cars
fougas
embraced
his
comrade
and
promised
him
to
be
of
good
cheer
after
the
train
left
the
three
colonels
went
back
to
town
on
foot
in
passing
m
rollons
house
fougas
said
to
his
successor
youre
not
very
hospitable
tonight
you
dont
even
offer
us
a
pony
of
that
good
andaye
brandy
i
thought

m

anything

your
coffee
or
afterwards
but
come
up
my
thirst
has
come
back
with
a
vengeance
thats
a
good
symptom
he
drank
in
a
melancholy
fashion
and
scarcely
wet
his
lips
in
his
glass
he
stopped
a
little
while
before
the
flag
took
hold
of
the
staff
spread
out
the
silk
counted
the
holes
that
cannon
balls
and
bullets
had
made
in
it
and
could
not
repress
his
tears
positively
said
he
the
brandy
has
taken
me
in
the
throat
im
not
a
man
tonight
good
evening
gentlemen
hold
on
well
go
back
with
you
oh
my
hotel
is
only
a
step
its
all
the
same
but
whats
your
idea
in
staying
at
a
hotel
when
you
have
two
houses
in
town
at
your
service
on
the
strength
of
that
i
am
going

tomorrow
the
next
morning
about
eleven
oclock
the
happy
leon
was
at
his
toilet
when
a
telegram
was
brought
to
him
he
opened
it
without
noticing
that
it
was
addressed
to
m
fougas
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
here
is
the
laconic
message
which
brought
him
so
much
pleasure
to
colonel
fougas
fontainebleau
just
left
the
emperor
you
to
be

better

leblanc
leon
dressed
himself
ran
to
the
hotel
of
the
blue
sundial
and
found
fougas
dead
in
his
bed
it
is
said
in
fontainebleau
that
m
nibor
made
an
autopsy
and
found
that
serious
disorders
had
been
produced
by
desiccation
some
people
are
nevertheless
satisfied
that
fougas
committed
suicide
it
is

that

from

of
his

man
passes
through
certain
periods
or
stages
each
of
which
is
marked
by
certain
conditions
peculiar
to
itself
for
instance
during
the
period
of
childhood
his
conditions
and
requirements
are
characteristic
of
that
degree
of
intelligence
and
capacity
after
a
time
he
enters
the
period
of
youth
in
which
his
former
conditions
and
needs
are
superseded
by
new
requirements
applicable
to
the
advance
in

his

awakened
the

no

restrict
his
energies
and

at

he
passes
out
of
the
period

and
enters
the
stage

no

satisfy
his

view
and

similarly
there
are
periods
and
stages
in
the
life
of
the
aggregate
world
of
humanity
which
at
one
time
was
passing
through
its
degree

childhood
at

its

youth
but
now
has
entered
its
long
presaged
period
of
maturity
the
evidences
of
which
are
everywhere
visible

apparent
therefore
the
requirements

have
changed
and
merged
into
exigencies

distinctly
characterize
the

neither

this
day

consummation
humanity
has
emerged
from
its
former
degrees

must
now
become
imbued
with
new
virtues
and

new
moralities
new

are
awaiting
and
already
descending
upon
him
the
gifts
and

of
the
period
of
youth
although
timely
and
sufficient
during
the
adolescence
of
the
world
of
mankind
are
now
incapable
of
meeting
the
requirements
of
its
maturity
the
playthings
of

and

no

satisfy

interest
the
adult
mind
from
every
standpoint
the
world
of
humanity
is
undergoing
a
reformation
the

of

are
in
process
of
revision
scientific
ideas

are
developing
and

industries
have
vastly
wider
scope
and

everywhere
the
world
of
mankind
is
in
the
throes
of
evolutionary
activity
indicating
the
passing
of
the
old
conditions
and
advent
of
the
new
age
of
reformation
old
trees
yield
no
fruitage
old
ideas
and
methods
are
obsolete
and
worthless
now
old
standards
of
ethics
moral
codes
and
methods
of
living
in
the
past
will
not
suffice
for
the
present
age
of
advancement
and
progress
this
is
the
cycle
of
maturity
and
reformation
in
religion
as
well
dogmatic
imitations
of
ancestral
beliefs
are
passing
they
have
been
the
axis
around
which
religion
revolved
but
now
are
no
longer
fruitful
on
the
contrary
in
this
day
they
have
become
the
cause
of
human
degradation
and
hindrance
bigotry
and
dogmatic
adherence
to
ancient
beliefs
have
become
the
central
and
fundamental
source
of
animosity
among
men
the
obstacle
to
human
progress
the
cause
of
warfare
and
strife
the
destroyer
of
peace
composure
and
welfare
in
the
world
consider

the
foundations
of
life
overturned
cities
laid
waste
and

made
desolate
by
the
ravages
of

these
conditions
are
the
outcome
of
hostility
and
hatred
between
nations
and
peoples
of
religion
who
imitate
and
adhere
to
the
forms
and
violate
the
spirit
and
reality
of
the
divine
teachings
while
this
is
true
and
apparent
it
is
likewise
evident
that
the
lord
of
mankind
has
bestowed
infinite
bounties
upon
the
world
in
this
century
of
maturity
and
consummation
the
ocean
of
divine
mercy
is
surging
the
vernal
showers
are
descending
the
sun
of
reality
is
shining
gloriously
heavenly
teachings
applicable
to
the
advancement
in
human
conditions
have
been
revealed
in
this
merciful
age
this
reformation
and
renewal
of
the
fundamental
reality
of
religion
constitute
the
true
and
outworking
spirit
of
modernism
the
unmistakable
light
of
the
world
the
manifest
effulgence
of
the
word
of
god
the
divine
remedy
for
all
human
ailment
and
the
bounty
of
eternal
life
to
all
mankind
the
source
of
reality
in
our
solar
system
the
center
of
illumination
is
the
sun
itself
through
the
will
of
god
this
central
luminary
is
the
one
source
of
the
existence
and
development
of
all
phenomenal
things
when
we
observe
the
organisms
of
the
material
kingdoms
we
find
that
their
growth
and
training
are
dependent
upon
the
heat
and
light
of
the
sun
without
this
quickening
impulse
there
would
be
no
growth
of
tree
or
vegetation
neither
would
the
existence
of
animal
or
human
being
be
possible
in
fact
no
forms
of
created
life
would
be
manifest
upon
the
earth
but
if
we
reflect
deeply
we
will
perceive
that
the
great
bestower
and
giver
of
life
is
god
the
sun
is
the
intermediary
of
his
will
and
plan
without
the
bounty
of
the
sun
therefore
the
world
would
be
in
darkness
all
illumination
of
our
planetary
system
proceeds
or
emanates
from
the
solar
center
likewise
in
the
spiritual
realm
of
intelligence
and
idealism
there
must
be
a
center
of
illumination
and
that
center
is
the
everlasting
evershining
sun
the
word
of
god
its
lights
are
the
lights
of
reality
which
have
shone
upon
humanity
illumining
the
realm
of
thought
and
morals
conferring
the
bounties
of
the
divine
world
upon
man
these
lights
are
the
cause
of
the
education
of
souls
and
the
source
of
the
enlightenment
of
hearts
sending
forth
in
effulgent
radiance
the
message
of
the
gladtidings
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
brief
the
moral
and
ethical
world
and
the
world
of
spiritual
regeneration
are
dependent
for
their
progressive
being
upon
that
heavenly
center
of
illumination
it
gives
forth
the
light
of
religion
and
bestows
the
life
of
the
spirit
imbues
humanity
with
archetypal
virtues
and
confers
eternal
splendors
this
sun
of
reality
this
center
of
effulgences
is
the
prophet
or
manifestation
of
god
just
as
the
phenomenal
sun
shines
upon
the
material
world
producing
life
and
growth
likewise
the
spiritual
or
prophetic
sun
confers
illumination
upon
the
human
world
of
thought
and
intelligence
and
unless
it
rose
upon
the
horizon
of
human
existence
the
kingdom
of
man
would
become
dark
and
extinguished
the
sun
of
reality
is
one
sun
but
it
has
different
dawningplaces
just
as
the
phenomenal
sun
is
one
although
it
appears
at
various
points
of
the
horizon
during
the
time
of
spring
the
luminary
of
the
physical
world
rises
far
to
the
north
of
the
equinoctial
in
summer
it
dawns
midway
and
in
winter
it
appears
in
the
most
southerly
point
of
its
zodiacal
journey
these
daysprings
or
dawningpoints
differ
widely
but
the
sun
is
ever
the
same
sun
whether
it
be
the
phenomenal
or
spiritual
luminary
souls
who
focus
their
vision
upon
the
sun
of
reality
will
be
the
recipients
of
light
no
matter
from
what
point
it
rises
but
those
who
are
fettered
by
adoration
of
the
dawningpoint
are
deprived
when
it
appears
in
a
different
station
upon
the
spiritual
horizon
furthermore
just
as
the
solar
cycle
has
its
four
seasons
the
cycle
of
the
sun
of
reality
has
its
distinct
and
successive
periods
each
brings
its
vernal
season
or
springtime
when
the
sun
of
reality
returns
to
quicken
the
world
of
mankind
a
divine
bounty
descends
from
the
heaven
of
generosity
the
realm
of
thoughts
and
ideals
is
set
in
motion
and
blessed
with
new
life
minds
are
developed
hopes
brighten
aspirations
become
spiritual
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
appear
with
freshened
power
of
growth
and
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
become
visible
in
man
it
is
the
springtime
of
the
inner
world
after
the
spring
summer
comes
with
its
fullness
and
fruitage
spiritual
autumn
follows
with
its
withering
winds
which
chill
the
soul
the
sun
seems
to
be
going
away
until
at
last
the
mantle
of
winter
overspreads
and
only
faint
traces
of
the
effulgence
of
that
divine
sun
remain
just
as
the
surface
of
the
material
world
becomes
dark
and
dreary
the
soil
dormant
the
trees
naked
and
bare
and
no
beauty
or
freshness
remain
to
cheer
the
darkness
and
desolation
so
the
winter
of
the
spiritual
cycle
witnesses
the
death
and
disappearance
of
divine
growth
and
extinction
of
the
light
and
love
of
god
but
again
the
cycle
begins
and
a
new
springtime
appears
in
it
the
former
springtime
has
returned
the
world
is
resuscitated
illumined
and
attains
spirituality
religion
is
renewed
and
reorganized
hearts
are
turned
to
god
the
summons
of
god
is
heard
and
life
is
again
bestowed
upon
man
for
a
long
time
the
religious
world
had
been
weakened
and
materialism
had
advanced
the
spiritual
forces
of
life
were
waning
moralities
were
becoming
degraded
composure
and
peace
had
vanished
from
souls
and
satanic
qualities
were
dominating
hearts
strife
and
hatred
overshadowed
humanity
bloodshed
and
violence
prevailed
god
was
neglected
the
sun
of
reality
seemed
to
have
gone
completely
deprivation
of
the
bounties
of
heaven
was
a
fact
and
so
the
season
of
winter
fell
upon
mankind
but
in
the
generosity
of
god
a
new
springtime
dawned
the
lights
of
god
shone
forth
the
effulgent
sun
of
reality
returned
and
became
manifest
the
realm
of
thoughts
and
kingdom
of
hearts
became
exhilarated
a
new
spirit
of
life
breathed
into
the
body
of
the
world
and
continuous
advancement
became
apparent
i
hope
that
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
reality
will
illumine
the
whole
world
so
that
no
strife
and
warfare
no
battles
and
bloodshed
remain
may
fanaticism
and
religious
bigotry
be
unknown
all
humanity
enter
the
bond
of
brotherhood
souls
consort
in
perfect
agreement
the
nations
of
earth
at
last
hoist
the
banner
of
truth
and
the
religions
of
the
world
enter
the
divine
temple
of
oneness
for
the
foundations
of
the
heavenly
religions
are
one
reality
reality
is
not
divisible
it
does
not
admit
multiplicity
all
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
have
proclaimed
and
promulgated
the
same
reality
they
have
summoned
mankind
to
reality
itself
and
reality
is
one
the
clouds
and
mists
of
imitations
have
obscured
the
sun
of
truth
we
must
forsake
these
imitations
dispel
these
clouds
and
mists
and
free
the
sun
from
the
darkness
of
superstition
then
will
the
sun
of
truth
shine
most
gloriously
then
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
will
be
united
the
religions
will
be
one
sects
and
denominations
will
reconcile
all
nationalities
will
flow
together
in
the
recognition
of
one
fatherhood
and
all
degrees
of
humankind
gather
in
the
shelter
of
the
same
tabernacle
under
the
same
banner
until
the
heavenly
civilization
is
founded
no
result
will
be
forthcoming
from
material
civilization
even
as
you
observe
see
what
catastrophes
overwhelm
mankind
consider
the
wars
which
disturb
the
world
consider
the
enmity
and
hatred
the
existence
of
these
wars
and
conditions
indicates
and
proves
that
the
heavenly
civilization
has
not
yet
been
established
if
the
civilization
of
the
kingdom
be
spread
to
all
the
nations
this
dust
of
disagreement
will
be
dispelled
these
clouds
will
pass
away
and
the
sun
of
reality
in
its
greatest
effulgence
and
glory
will
shine
upon
mankind
the
dawn
of
peace
the
fatherhood
of
god
his
lovingkindness
and
beneficence
are
apparent
to
all
in
his
mercy
he
provides
fully
and
amply
for
his
creatures
and
if
any
soul
sins
he
does
not
suspend
his
bounty
all
created
things
are
visible
manifestations
of
his
fatherhood
mercy
and
heavenly
bestowals
human
brotherhood
is
likewise
as
clear
and
evident
as
the
sun
for
all
are
servants
of
one
god
belong
to
one
humankind
inhabit
the
same
globe
are
sheltered
beneath
the
overshadowing
dome
of
heaven
and
submerged
in
the
sea
of
divine
mercy
human
brotherhood
and
dependence
exist
because
mutual
helpfulness
and
cooperation
are
the
two
necessary
principles
underlying
human
welfare
this
is
the
physical
relationship
of
mankind
there
is
another
brotherhood
the
spiritual
which
is
higher
holier
and
superior
to
all
others
it
is
heavenly
it
emanates
from
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
the
effulgence
of
merciful
attributes
it
is
founded
upon
spiritual
susceptibilities
this
brotherhood
is
established
by
the
manifestations
of
the
holy
one
the
divine
manifestations
since
the
day
of
adam
have
striven
to
unite
humanity
so
that
all
may
be
accounted
as
one
soul
the
function
and
purpose
of
a
shepherd
is
to
gather
and
not
disperse
his
flock
the
prophets
of
god
have
been
divine
shepherds
of
humanity
they
have
established
a
bond
of
love
and
unity
among
mankind
made
scattered
peoples
one
nation
and
wandering
tribes
a
mighty
kingdom
they
have
laid
the
foundation
of
the
oneness
of
god
and
summoned
all
to
universal
peace
all
these
holy
divine
manifestations
are
one
they
have
served
one
god
promulgated
the
same
truth
founded
the
same
institutions
and
reflected
the
same
light
their
appearances
have
been
successive
and
correlated
each
one
has
announced
and
extolled
the
one
who
was
to
follow
and
all
laid
the
foundation
of
reality
they
summoned
and
invited
the
people
to
love
and
made
the
human
world
a
mirror
of
the
word
of
god
therefore
the
divine
religions
they
established
have
one
foundation
their
teachings
proofs
and
evidences
are
one
in
name
and
form
they
differ
but
in
reality
they
agree
and
are
the
same
these
holy
manifestations
have
been
as
the
coming
of
springtime
in
the
world
although
the
springtime
of
this
year
is
designated
by
another
name
according
to
the
changing
calendar
yet
as
regards
its
life
and
quickening
it
is
the
same
as
the
springtime
of
last
year
for
each
spring
is
the
time
of
a
new
creation
the
effects
bestowals
perfections
and
lifegiving
forces
of
which
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
former
vernal
seasons
although
the
names
are
many
and
various
this
is
last
years
was
and
so
on
but
in
fundamental
reality
no
difference
is
apparent
the
sun
is
one
but
the
dawningpoints
of
the
sun
are
numerous
and
changing
the
ocean
is
one
body
of
water
but
different
parts
of
it
have
particular
designation
atlantic
pacific
mediterranean
antarctic
etc
if
we
consider
the
names
there
is
differentiation
but
the
water
the
ocean
itself
is
one
reality
likewise
the
divine
religions
of
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
are
in
reality
one
though
in
name
and
nomenclature
they
differ
man
must
be
a
lover
of
the
light
no
matter
from
what
dayspring
it
may
appear
he
must
be
a
lover
of
the
rose
no
matter
in
what
soil
it
may
be
growing
he
must
be
a
seeker
of
the
truth
no
matter
from
what
source
it
come
attachment
to
the
lantern
is
not
loving
the
light
attachment
to
the
earth
is
not
befitting
but
enjoyment
of
the
rose
which
develops
from
the
soil
is
worthy
devotion
to
the
tree
is
profitless
but
partaking
of
the
fruit
is
beneficial
luscious
fruits
no
matter
upon
what
tree
they
grow
or
where
they
may
be
found
must
be
enjoyed
the
word
of
truth
no
matter
which
tongue
utters
it
must
be
sanctioned
absolute
verities
no
matter
in
what
book
they
be
recorded
must
be
accepted
if
we
harbor
prejudice
it
will
be
the
cause
of
deprivation
and
ignorance
the
strife
between
religions
nations
and
races
arises
from
misunderstanding
if
we
investigate
the
religions
to
discover
the
principles
underlying
their
foundations
we
will
find
they
agree
for
the
fundamental
reality
of
them
is
one
and
not
multiple
by
this
means
the
religionists
of
the
world
will
reach
their
point
of
unity
and
reconciliation
they
will
ascertain
the
truth
that
the
purpose
of
religion
is
the
acquisition
of
praiseworthy
virtues
betterment
of
morals
spiritual
development
of
mankind
the
real
life
and
divine
bestowals
all
the
prophets
have
been
the
promoters
of
these
principles
none
of
them
has
been
the
promoter
of
corruption
vice
or
evil
they
have
summoned
mankind
to
all
good
they
have
united
people
in
the
love
of
god
invited
them
to
the
religions
of
the
unity
of
mankind
and
exhorted
them
to
amity
and
agreement
for
example
we
mention
abraham
and
moses
by
this
mention
we
do
not
mean
the
limitation
implied
in
the
mere
names
but
intend
the
virtues
which
these
names
embody
when
we
say
abraham
we
mean
thereby
a
manifestation
of
divine
guidance
a
center
of
human
virtues
a
source
of
heavenly
bestowals
to
mankind
a
dawningpoint
of
divine
inspiration
and
perfections
these
perfections
and
graces
are
not
limited
to
names
and
boundaries
when
we
find
these
virtues
qualities
and
attributes
in
any
personality
we
recognize
the
same
reality
shining
from
within
and
bow
in
acknowledgment
of
the
abrahamic
perfections
similarly
we
acknowledge
and
adore
the
beauty
of
moses
some
souls
were
lovers
of
the
name
abraham
loving
the
lantern
instead
of
the
light
and
when
they
saw
this
same
light
shining
from
another
lantern
they
were
so
attached
to
the
former
lantern
that
they
did
not
recognize
its
later
appearance
and
illumination
therefore
those
who
were
attached
and
held
tenaciously
to
the
name
abraham
were
deprived
when
the
abrahamic
virtues
reappeared
in
moses
similarly
the
jews
were
believers
in
his
holiness
moses
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
messiah
the
virtues
and
perfections
of
moses
became
apparent
in
his
holiness
jesus
christ
most
effulgently
but
the
jews
held
to
the
name
moses
not
adoring
the
virtues
and
perfections
manifest
in
him
had
they
been
adoring
these
virtues
and
seeking
these
perfections
they
would
assuredly
have
believed
in
his
holiness
jesus
christ
when
the
same
virtues
and
perfections
shone
in
him
if
we
are
lovers
of
the
light
we
adore
it
in
whatever
lamp
it
may
become
manifest
but
if
we
love
the
lamp
itself
and
the
light
is
transferred
to
another
lamp
we
will
neither
accept
nor
sanction
it
therefore
we
must
follow
and
adore
the
virtues
revealed
in
the
messengers
of
god
whether
in
abraham
moses
jesus
or
other
prophets
but
we
must
not
adhere
to
and
adore
the
lamp
we
must
recognize
the
sun
no
matter
from
what
dawningpoint
it
may
shine
forth
be
it
mosaic
abrahamic
or
any
personal
point
of
orientation
whatever
for
we
are
lovers
of
sunlight
and
not
of
orientation
we
are
lovers
of
illumination
and
not
of
lamps
and
candles
we
are
seekers
for
water
no
matter
from
what
rock
it
may
gush
forth
we
are
in
need
of
fruit
in
whatsoever
orchard
it
may
be
ripened
we
long
for
rain
it
matters
not
which
cloud
pours
it
down
we
must
not
be
fettered
if
we
renounce
these
fetters
we
shall
agree
for
all
are
seekers
of
reality
the
counterfeit
or
imitation
of
true
religion
has
adulterated
human
belief
and
the
foundations
have
been
lost
sight
of
the
variance
of
these
imitations
has
produced
enmity
and
strife
war
and
bloodshed
now
the
glorious
and
brilliant
twentieth
century
has
dawned
and
the
divine
bounty
is
radiating
universally
the
sun
of
truth
is
shining
forth
in
intense
enkindlement
this
is
verily
the
century
when
these
imitations
must
be
forsaken
superstitions
abandoned
and
god
alone
worshiped
we
must
look
at
the
reality
of
the
prophets
and
their
teachings
in
order
that
we
may
agree
praise
be
to
god
the
springtime
of
god
is
at
hand
this
century
is
verily
the
spring
season
the
world
of
mind
and
the
kingdom
of
soul
have
become
fresh
and
verdant
by
its
bestowals
it
has
resuscitated
the
whole
realm
of
existence
on
one
hand
the
lights
of
reality
are
shining
on
the
other
the
clouds
of
divine
mercy
are
pouring
down
the
fullness
of
heavenly
bounty
wonderful
material
progress
is
evident
and
great
spiritual
discoveries
are
being
made
truly
this
can
be
called
the
miracle
of
centuries
for
it
is
replete
with
manifestations
of
the
miraculous
the
time
has
come
when
all
mankind
shall
be
united
when
all
races
shall
be
loyal
to
one
fatherland
all
religions
become
one
religion
and
racial
and
religious
bias
pass
away
it
is
a
day
in
which
the
oneness
of
humankind
shall
uplift
its
standard
and
international
peace
like
the
true
morning
flood
the
world
with
its
light
therefore
we
offer
supplications
to
god
asking
him
to
dispel
these
gloomy
clouds
and
uproot
these
imitations
in
order
that
the
east
and
west
may
become
radiant
with
love
and
unity
that
the
nations
of
the
world
shall
embrace
each
other
and
the
ideal
spiritual
brotherhood
illumine
the
world
like
the
glorious
sun
of
the
high
heavens
the
cause
of
strife
in
the
estimation
of
historians
this
radiant
century
is
equivalent
to
one
hundred
centuries
of
the
past
if
comparison
be
made
with
the
sum
total
of
all
former
human
achievements
it
will
be
found
that
the
discoveries
scientific
advancement
and
material
civilization
of
this
present
century
have
equaled
yea
far
exceeded
the
progress
and
outcome
of
one
hundred
former
centuries
the
production
of
books
and
compilations
of
literature
alone
bear
witness
that
the
output
of
the
human
mind
in
this
century
has
been
greater
and
more
enlightening
than
all
the
past
centuries
together
it
is
evident
therefore
that
this
century
is
of
paramount
importance
reflect
upon
the
miracles
of
accomplishment
which
have
already
characterized
it
the
discoveries
in
every
realm
of
human
research
inventions
scientific
knowledge
ethical
reforms
and
regulations
established
for
the
welfare
of
humanity
mysteries
of
nature
explored
invisible
forces
brought
into
visibility
and
subjection
a
veritable
wonderworld
of
new
phenomena
and
conditions
heretofore
unknown
to
man
now
open
to
his
uses
and
further
investigation
the
east
and
west
can
communicate
instantly
a
human
being
can
soar
in
the
skies
or
speed
in
submarine
depths
the
power
of
steam
has
linked
the
continents
trains
cross
the
deserts
and
pierce
the
barriers
of
mountains
ships
find
unerring
pathways
upon
the
trackless
oceans
day
by
day
discoveries
are
increasing
what
a
wonderful
century
this
is
it
is
an
age
of
universal
reformation
laws
and
statutes
of
governments
civil
and
federal
are
in
process
of
change
and
transformation
sciences
and
arts
are
being
moulded
anew
thoughts
are
metamorphosed
the
foundations
of
human
society
are
changing
and
strengthening
today
sciences
of
the
past
are
useless
the
ptolemaic
system
of
astronomy
numberless
other
systems
and
theories
of
scientific
and
philosophical
explanation
are
discarded
known
to
be
false
and
worthless
ethical
precedents
and
principles
cannot
be
applied
to
the
needs
of
the
modern
world
thoughts
and
theories
of
past
ages
are
fruitless
now
thrones
and
governments
are
crumbling
and
falling
all
conditions
and
requisites
of
the
past
unfitted
and
inadequate
for
the
present
time
are
undergoing
radical
reform
it
is
evident
therefore
that
counterfeit
and
spurious
religious
teaching
antiquated
forms
of
belief
and
ancestral
imitations
which
are
at
variance
with
the
foundations
of
divine
reality
must
also
pass
away
and
be
reformed
they
must
be
abandoned
and
new
conditions
be
recognized
the
morals
of
humanity
must
undergo
change
new
remedy
and
solution
for
human
problems
must
be
adopted
human
intellects
themselves
must
change
and
be
subject
to
the
universal
reformation
just
as
the
thoughts
and
hypotheses
of
past
ages
are
fruitless
today
likewise
dogmas
and
codes
of
human
invention
are
obsolete
and
barren
of
product
in
religion
nay
it
is
true
that
they
are
the
cause
of
enmity
and
conducive
to
strife
in
the
world
of
humanity
war
and
bloodshed
proceed
from
them
and
the
oneness
of
mankind
finds
no
recognition
in
their
observance
therefore
it
is
our
duty
in
this
radiant
century
to
investigate
the
essentials
of
divine
religion
seek
the
realities
underlying
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
discover
the
source
of
fellowship
and
agreement
which
will
unite
mankind
in
the
heavenly
bond
of
love
this
unity
is
the
radiance
of
eternity
the
divine
spirituality
the
effulgence
of
god
and
the
bounty
of
the
kingdom
we
must
investigate
the
divine
source
of
these
heavenly
bestowals
and
adhere
unto
them
steadfastly
for
if
we
remain
fettered
and
restricted
by
human
inventions
and
dogmas
day
by
day
the
world
of
mankind
will
be
degraded
day
by
day
warfare
and
strife
will
increase
and
satanic
forces
converge
toward
the
destruction
of
the
human
race
if
love
and
agreement
are
manifest
in
a
single
family
that
family
will
advance
become
illumined
and
spiritual
but
if
enmity
and
hatred
exist
within
it
destruction
and
dispersion
are
inevitable
this
is
likewise
true
of
a
city
if
those
who
dwell
within
it
manifest
a
spirit
of
accord
and
fellowship
it
will
progress
steadily
and
human
conditions
become
brighter
whereas
through
enmity
and
strife
it
will
be
degraded
and
its
inhabitants
scattered
in
the
same
way
the
people
of
a
nation
develop
and
advance
toward
civilization
and
enlightenment
through
love
and
accord
and
are
disintegrated
by
war
and
strife
finally
this
is
true
of
humanity
itself
in
the
aggregate
when
love
is
realized
and
the
ideal
spiritual
bonds
unite
the
hearts
of
men
the
whole
human
race
will
be
uplifted
the
world
will
continually
grow
more
spiritual
and
radiant
and
the
happiness
and
tranquillity
of
mankind
be
immeasurably
increased
warfare
and
strife
will
be
uprooted
disagreement
and
dissension
pass
away
and
universal
peace
unite
the
nations
and
peoples
of
the
world
all
mankind
will
dwell
together
as
one
family
blend
as
the
waves
of
one
sea
shine
as
stars
of
one
firmament
and
appear
as
fruits
of
the
same
tree
this
is
the
happiness
and
felicity
of
humankind
this
is
the
illumination
of
man
the
glory
eternal
and
life
everlasting
this
is
the
divine
bestowal
i
desire
this
station
for
you
and
i
pray
god
that
the
people
of
america
may
achieve
this
great
end
in
order
that
the
virtue
of
this
democracy
may
be
insured
and
their
names
be
glorified
eternally
universal
peace
today
there
is
no
greater
glory
for
man
than
that
of
service
in
the
cause
of
the
most
great
peace
peace
is
light
whereas
war
is
darkness
peace
is
life
war
is
death
peace
is
guidance
war
is
error
peace
is
the
foundation
of
god
war
is
satanic
institution
peace
is
the
illumination
of
the
world
of
humanity
war
is
the
destroyer
of
human
foundations
when
we
consider
outcomes
in
the
world
of
existence
we
find
that
peace
and
fellowship
are
factors
of
upbuilding
and
betterment
whereas
war
and
strife
are
the
causes
of
destruction
and
disintegration
all
created
things
are
expressions
of
the
affinity
and
cohesion
of
elementary
substances
and
nonexistence
is
the
absence
of
their
attraction
and
agreement
various
elements
unite
harmoniously
in
composition
but
when
these
elements
become
discordant
repelling
each
other
decomposition
and
nonexistence
result
everything
partakes
of
this
nature
and
is
subject
to
this
principle
for
the
creative
foundation
in
all
its
degrees
and
kingdoms
is
an
expression
or
outcome
of
love
consider
the
restlessness
and
agitation
of
the
human
world
today
because
of
war
peace
is
health
and
construction
war
is
disease
and
dissolution
when
the
banner
of
truth
is
raised
peace
becomes
the
cause
of
the
welfare
and
advancement
of
the
human
world
in
all
cycles
and
ages
war
has
been
a
factor
of
derangement
and
discomfort
whereas
peace
and
brotherhood
have
brought
security
and
consideration
of
human
interests
this
distinction
is
especially
pronounced
in
the
present
world
conditions
for
warfare
in
former
centuries
had
not
attained
the
degree
of
savagery
and
destructiveness
which
now
characterizes
it
if
two
nations
were
at
war
in
olden
times
ten
or
twenty
thousand
would
be
sacrificed
but
in
this
century
the
destruction
of
one
hundred
thousand
lives
in
a
day
is
quite
possible
so
perfected
has
the
science
of
killing
become
and
so
efficient
the
means
and
instruments
of
its
accomplishment
that
a
whole
nation
can
be
obliterated
in
a
short
time
therefore
comparison
with
the
methods
and
results
of
ancient
warfare
is
out
of
the
question
according
to
an
intrinsic
law
all
phenomena
of
being
attain
to
a
summit
and
degree
of
consummation
after
which
a
new
order
and
condition
is
established
as
the
instruments
and
science
of
war
have
reached
the
degree
of
thoroughness
and
proficiency
it
is
hoped
that
the
transformation
of
the
human
world
is
at
hand
and
that
in
the
coming
centuries
all
the
energies
and
inventions
of
man
will
be
utilized
in
promoting
the
interests
of
peace
and
brotherhood
therefore
may
this
esteemed
and
worthy
society
for
the
establishment
of
international
peace
be
confirmed
in
its
sincere
intentions
and
empowered
by
god
then
will
it
hasten
the
time
when
the
banner
of
universal
agreement
will
be
raised
and
international
welfare
will
be
proclaimed
and
consummated
so
that
the
darkness
which
now
encompasses
the
world
shall
pass
away
the
powers
of
earth
cannot
withstand
the
privileges
and
bestowals
which
god
has
ordained
for
this
great
and
glorious
century
it
is
a
need
and
exigency
of
the
time
man
can
withstand
anything
except
that
which
is
divinely
intended
and
indicated
for
the
age
and
its
requirements
now
praise
be
to
god
in
all
countries
of
the
world
lovers
of
peace
are
to
be
found
and
these
principles
are
being
spread
among
mankind
especially
in
this
country
praise
be
to
god
this
thought
is
prevailing
and
souls
are
continually
arising
as
defenders
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
endeavoring
to
assist
and
establish
international
peace
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
wonderful
democracy
will
be
able
to
realize
it
and
the
banner
of
international
agreement
will
be
unfurled
here
to
spread
onward
and
outward
among
all
the
nations
of
the
world
i
give
thanks
to
god
that
i
find
you
imbued
with
such
susceptibilities
and
lofty
aspirations
and
i
hope
that
you
will
be
the
means
of
spreading
this
light
to
all
men
thus
may
the
sun
of
reality
shine
upon
the
east
and
west
the
enveloping
clouds
shall
pass
away
and
the
heat
of
the
divine
rays
will
dispel
the
mist
the
reality
of
man
shall
develop
and
come
forth
as
the
image
of
god
his
creator
the
thoughts
of
man
shall
take
such
upward
flight
that
former
accomplishments
shall
appear
as
the
play
of
childrenfor
the
ideas
and
beliefs
of
the
past
and
the
prejudices
regarding
race
and
religion
have
ever
been
lowering
and
destructive
to
human
evolution
i
am
most
hopeful
that
in
this
century
these
lofty
thoughts
shall
be
conducive
to
human
welfare
let
this
century
be
the
sun
of
previous
centuries
the
effulgences
of
which
shall
last
forever
so
that
in
times
to
come
they
shall
glorify
the
twentieth
century
saying
the
twentieth
century
was
the
century
of
lights
the
twentieth
century
was
the
century
of
life
the
twentieth
century
was
the
century
of
international
peace
the
twentieth
century
was
the
century
of
divine
bestowals
and
the
twentieth
century
has
left
traces
which
shall
last
forever
the
prophets
and
war
when
we
review
history
from
the
beginning
down
to
the
present
day
we
find
that
strife
and
warfare
have
prevailed
throughout
the
human
world
wars
religious
racial
or
political
have
arisen
from
human
ignorance
misunderstanding
and
lack
of
education
we
will
first
consider
religious
strife
and
conflict
it
is
evident
that
the
divine
prophets
have
appeared
in
the
world
to
establish
love
and
agreement
among
mankind
they
have
been
the
shepherds
and
not
the
wolves
the
shepherd
comes
forth
to
gather
and
lead
his
flock
and
not
to
disperse
them
by
creating
strife
every
divine
shepherd
has
assembled
a
flock
which
had
formerly
been
scattered
among
the
shepherds
was
his
holiness
moses
at
a
time
when
the
tribes
of
israel
were
wandering
and
dispersed
he
assembled
united
and
educated
them
to
higher
degrees
of
capacity
and
progress
until
they
passed
out
of
the
wilderness
of
discipline
into
the
holy
land
of
possession
he
transformed
their
degradation
into
glory
changed
their
poverty
into
wealth
and
replaced
their
vices
by
virtues
until
they
rose
to
such
a
zenith
that
the
splendor
of
the
sovereignty
of
solomon
was
made
possible
and
the
fame
of
their
civilization
extended
to
the
east
and
the
west
it
is
evident
therefore
that
his
holiness
was
a
divine
shepherd
for
he
gathered
the
tribes
of
israel
together
and
united
them
in
the
power
and
strength
of
a
great
nationhood
when
the
messianic
star
of
jesus
christ
dawned
he
declared
he
had
come
to
gather
together
the
lost
tribes
or
scattered
sheep
of
moses
he
not
only
shepherded
the
flock
of
israel
but
brought
together
people
of
chaldea
egypt
syria
ancient
assyria
and
phoenicia
these
people
were
in
a
state
of
utmost
hostility
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
each
other
with
the
ferocity
of
animals
but
his
holiness
jesus
christ
brought
them
together
cemented
and
united
them
in
his
cause
and
established
such
a
bond
of
love
among
them
that
enmity
and
warfare
were
abandoned
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
divine
teachings
are
intended
to
create
a
bond
of
unity
in
the
human
world
and
establish
the
foundations
of
love
and
fellowship
among
mankind
divine
religion
is
not
a
cause
for
discord
and
disagreement
if
religion
becomes
the
source
of
antagonism
and
strife
the
absence
of
religion
is
to
be
preferred
religion
is
meant
to
be
the
quickening
life
of
the
body
politic
if
it
be
the
cause
of
death
to
humanity
its
nonexistence
would
be
a
blessing
and
benefit
to
man
therefore
in
this
day
the
divine
teachings
must
be
sought
for
they
are
the
remedies
for
the
present
conditions
of
the
world
of
humanity
at
a
time
when
the
arabian
tribes
and
nomadic
peoples
were
widely
separated
living
in
the
deserts
under
lawless
conditions
strife
and
bloodshed
continual
among
them
no
tribe
free
from
the
menace
of
attack
and
destruction
by
anotherat
such
a
critical
time
mohammed
appeared
he
gathered
these
wild
tribes
of
the
desert
together
reconciled
united
and
caused
them
to
agree
so
that
enmity
and
warfare
ceased
the
arabian
nation
immediately
advanced
until
its
dominion
extended
westward
to
spain
and
andalusia
from
these
facts
and
premises
we
may
conclude
that
the
establishing
of
the
divine
religions
is
for
peace
not
for
war
and
the
shedding
of
blood
inasmuch
as
all
are
founded
upon
one
reality
which
is
love
and
unity
the
wars
and
dissensions
which
have
characterized
the
history
of
religion
have
been
due
to
imitations
and
superstitions
which
arise
afterward
religion
is
reality
and
reality
is
one
the
fundamentals
of
the
religion
of
god
are
therefore
one
in
reality
there
is
neither
difference
nor
change
in
the
fundamentals
variance
is
caused
by
blind
imitations
prejudices
and
adherence
to
forms
which
appear
later
and
inasmuch
as
these
differ
discord
and
strife
result
if
the
religions
of
the
world
would
forsake
these
causes
of
difficulty
and
seek
the
fundamentals
all
would
agree
and
strife
and
dissension
would
pass
away
for
religion
and
reality
are
one
and
not
multiple
other
wars
are
caused
by
purely
imaginary
racial
differences
for
humanity
is
one
kind
one
race
and
progeny
inhabiting
the
same
globe
in
the
creative
plan
there
is
no
racial
distinction
and
separation
such
as
frenchman
englishman
american
german
italian
or
spaniard
all
belong
to
one
household
these
boundaries
and
distinctions
are
human
and
artificial
not
natural
and
original
all
mankind
are
the
fruits
of
one
tree
flowers
of
the
same
garden
waves
of
one
sea
in
the
animal
kingdom
no
such
distinction
and
separation
are
observed
the
sheep
of
the
east
and
the
sheep
of
the
west
would
associate
peacefully
the
oriental
flock
would
not
look
surprised
as
if
saying
these
are
sheep
of
the
occident
they
do
not
belong
to
our
country
all
would
gather
in
harmony
and
enjoy
the
same
pasture
without
evidence
of
local
or
racial
distinction
the
birds
of
different
countries
mingle
in
friendliness
we
find
these
virtues
in
the
animal
kingdom
shall
man
deprive
himself
of
these
virtues
man
is
endowed
with
superior
reasoning
power
and
the
faculty
of
perception
he
is
the
manifestation
of
divine
bestowals
shall
racial
ideas
prevail
and
obscure
the
creative
purpose
of
unity
in
his
kingdom
shall
he
say
i
am
a
german
i
am
a
frenchman
or
an
englishman
and
declare
war
because
of
this
imaginary
and
human
distinction
god
forbid
this
earth
is
one
household
and
the
nativity
of
all
humanity
therefore
the
human
race
should
ignore
distinctions
and
boundaries
which
are
artificial
and
conducive
to
disagreement
and
hostility
we
have
come
from
the
east
praise
be
to
god
we
find
this
continent
prosperous
the
climate
salubrious
and
delightful
the
inhabitants
genial
and
courteous
the
government
equable
and
just
shall
we
entertain
any
other
thought
and
feeling
than
that
of
love
for
you
shall
we
say
this
is
not
our
native
land
therefore
everything
is
objectionable
this
would
be
gross
ignorance
to
which
man
must
not
subject
himself
man
is
endowed
with
powers
to
investigate
reality
and
the
reality
is
that
humanity
is
one
in
kind
and
equal
in
the
creative
plan
therefore
false
distinctions
of
race
and
nativity
which
are
factors
and
causes
of
warfare
must
be
abandoned
consider
what
is
happening
in
tripoli
how
the
poor
are
being
killed
and
the
blood
of
the
helpless
is
being
shed
upon
both
sides
children
made
fatherless
fathers
lamenting
the
death
of
their
sons
mothers
bewailing
the
loss
of
dear
ones
and
what
is
the
benefit
after
all
nothing
conceivable
is
it
therefore
justifiable
the
domestic
animals
do
not
manifest
hatred
and
cruelty
toward
each
other
that
is
the
attribute
of
the
wild
and
ferocious
beasts
in
a
flock
of
one
thousand
sheep
you
will
witness
no
bloodshed
numberless
species
of
birds
are
peaceful
in
flocks
wolves
lions
tigers
are
ferocious
because
it
is
their
natural
and
necessary
means
for
obtaining
food
man
has
no
need
of
such
ferocity
his
food
is
provided
in
other
ways
therefore
it
is
evident
that
warfare
cruelty
and
bloodshed
in
the
kingdom
of
man
are
caused
by
human
greed
hatred
and
selfishness
the
kings
and
rulers
of
nations
enjoy
luxury
and
ease
in
their
palaces
and
send
the
common
people
to
the
battlefield
offer
them
as
the
food
and
targets
of
cannon
each
day
they
invent
new
instruments
for
the
more
complete
destruction
of
the
foundations
of
the
human
race
they
are
callous
and
merciless
toward
their
fellowcreatures
what
shall
atone
for
the
sufferings
and
grief
of
mothers
who
have
so
tenderly
cared
for
their
sons
what
sleepless
nights
they
have
spent
and
what
days
of
devotion
and
love
they
have
given
to
bring
their
children
to
maturity
yet
the
savagery
of
these
warring
rulers
causes
great
numbers
of
their
victims
to
be
torn
and
mutilated
in
a
day
what
ignorance
and
degradation
yea
even
greater
than
the
ferocious
beasts
themselves
for
a
wolf
will
carry
away
and
devour
one
sheep
at
a
time
whereas
an
ambitious
tyrant
may
cause
the
death
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
in
a
battle
and
glory
in
his
military
prowess
saying
i
am
commanderinchief
i
have
won
this
mighty
victory
consider
the
ignorance
and
inconsistency
of
the
human
race
if
a
man
kills
another
no
matter
what
the
cause
may
be
he
is
pronounced
a
murderer
imprisoned
or
executed
but
the
brutal
oppressor
who
has
slain
one
hundred
thousand
is
idolized
as
a
hero
conqueror
or
military
genius
a
man
steals
a
small
sum
of
money
he
is
called
a
thief
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
but
the
military
leader
who
invades
and
pillages
a
whole
kingdom
is
acclaimed
heroic
and
a
mighty
man
of
valor
how
base
and
ignorant
is
man
in
persia
previous
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
among
the
various
tribes
and
peoples
sects
and
denominations
there
existed
the
greatest
animosity
strife
and
hatred
at
that
time
too
all
the
other
nations
of
the
east
were
in
the
same
condition
religionists
were
hostile
and
bigoted
sects
were
at
enmity
races
hated
each
other
tribes
were
constantly
at
war
everywhere
antagonism
and
conflict
prevailed
men
shunned
and
were
suspicious
of
each
other
the
man
who
could
kill
a
number
of
his
fellowcreatures
was
glorified
for
his
heroism
and
strength
among
religionists
it
was
esteemed
a
praiseworthy
deed
to
take
the
life
of
one
who
held
an
opposite
belief
at
this
time
bahaullah
arose
and
declared
his
mission
he
founded
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
proclaimed
that
all
are
servants
of
the
loving
and
merciful
god
who
has
created
nourished
and
provided
for
all
therefore
why
should
men
be
unjust
and
unkind
to
each
other
showing
forth
that
which
is
contrary
to
god
as
he
loves
us
why
should
we
entertain
animosity
and
hate
if
god
did
not
love
all
he
would
not
have
created
trained
and
provided
for
all
lovingkindness
is
the
divine
policy
shall
we
consider
human
policy
and
attitude
superior
to
the
wisdom
and
policy
of
god
this
would
be
inconceivable
impossible
therefore
we
must
emulate
and
follow
the
divine
policy
dealing
with
each
other
in
the
utmost
love
and
tenderness
bahaullah
declared
the
most
great
peace
and
international
arbitration
he
voiced
these
principles
in
numerous
epistles
which
were
circulated
broadcast
throughout
the
east
he
wrote
to
all
the
kings
and
rulers
encouraging
advising
and
admonishing
them
in
regard
to
the
establishment
of
peace
making
it
evident
by
conclusive
proofs
that
the
happiness
and
glory
of
humanity
can
only
be
assured
through
disarmament
and
arbitration
this
was
nearly
fifty
years
ago
because
he
promulgated
the
message
of
universal
peace
and
international
agreement
the
kings
of
the
orient
arose
against
him
for
they
did
not
find
their
personal
and
national
benefits
advanced
by
his
admonition
and
teaching
they
persecuted
him
bitterly
inflicted
upon
him
every
torment
imprisoned
bastinadoed
banished
him
and
eventually
confined
him
in
a
fortress
then
they
arose
against
his
followers
for
the
establishment
of
international
peace
the
blood
of
twenty
thousand
bahais
was
spilt
their
homes
were
destroyed
their
children
made
captives
and
their
possessions
pillaged
yet
none
of
these
people
waxed
cold
or
wavered
in
devotion
even
to
this
day
the
bahais
are
persecuted
and
quite
recently
a
number
were
killed
for
wherever
they
are
found
they
put
forth
the
greatest
efforts
to
establish
the
peace
of
the
world
they
not
only
promulgate
principles
they
are
people
of
action
in
persia
today
through
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
you
will
find
people
of
various
religious
beliefs
and
denominations
living
together
in
the
utmost
peace
and
agreement
the
former
enmities
and
hatred
have
passed
away
and
they
exercise
the
utmost
love
toward
all
mankind
for
they
realize
and
know
that
all
are
the
creatures
and
servants
of
one
god
this
is
directly
due
to
the
divine
teachings
at
most
it
is
simply
this
that
the
ignorant
must
be
educated
the
ailing
must
be
healed
those
who
are
as
children
in
the
scale
of
development
must
be
helped
to
reach
the
age
of
maturity
we
must
not
be
unfriendly
to
any
one
because
of
ignorance
neither
must
we
reject
the
immature
or
turn
away
from
the
sick
but
administer
the
remedy
for
each
human
need
until
all
are
united
in
the
providence
of
god
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
essential
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
are
unity
and
love
if
religion
be
productive
of
discord
among
mankind
it
is
a
destroyer
and
not
divine
for
religion
implies
unity
and
binding
together
and
not
separation
mere
knowledge
of
principles
is
not
sufficient
we
all
know
and
admit
that
justice
is
good
but
there
is
need
of
volition
and
action
to
carry
out
and
manifest
it
for
example
we
might
think
it
good
to
build
a
church
but
simply
thinking
of
it
as
a
good
thing
will
not
help
its
erection
the
ways
and
means
must
be
provided
we
must
will
to
build
it
and
then
proceed
with
the
construction
all
of
us
know
that
international
peace
is
good
that
it
is
conducive
to
human
welfare
and
the
glory
of
man
but
volition
and
action
are
necessary
before
it
can
be
established
action
is
the
essential
inasmuch
as
this
century
is
a
century
of
light
capacity
for
action
is
assured
to
mankind
necessarily
the
divine
principles
will
be
spread
among
men
until
the
time
of
action
arrives
surely
this
has
been
so
and
truly
the
time
and
conditions
are
ripe
for
action
now
all
men
know
that
verily
war
is
the
destroyer
of
human
foundations
and
in
every
country
of
the
world
this
is
admitted
and
apparent
i
find
the
united
states
of
america
an
exceedingly
progressive
nation
the
government
just
the
people
in
a
state
of
readiness
and
the
principle
of
equality
established
to
an
extraordinary
degree
therefore
it
is
my
hope
that
inasmuch
as
the
standard
of
international
peace
must
be
upraised
it
may
be
upraised
upon
this
continent
for
this
nation
is
more
deserving
and
has
greater
capacity
for
such
an
initial
step
than
any
other
if
other
nations
should
attempt
to
do
this
the
motive
will
be
misunderstood
for
instance
if
great
britain
should
declare
for
international
peace
it
will
be
said
that
it
has
been
done
to
insure
the
safety
of
her
colonies
if
france
should
hoist
the
standard
other
nations
will
declare
some
hidden
diplomatic
policy
underlies
the
action
russia
would
be
suspected
of
national
designs
if
the
first
step
were
taken
by
that
people
and
so
on
with
all
the
european
and
eastern
governments
but
the
united
states
of
america
could
not
be
accused
of
any
such
selfish
interest
your
government
has
strictly
speaking
no
colonies
to
protect
you
are
not
endeavoring
to
extend
your
domain
nor
have
you
need
of
territorial
expansion
therefore
if
america
takes
the
first
step
toward
the
establishing
of
world
peace
it
is
certain
to
be
ascribed
to
unselfishness
and
altruism
the
world
will
say
there
is
no
other
motive
than
altruism
and
service
to
humanity
in
this
action
by
the
united
states
therefore
it
is
my
hope
that
you
may
stand
forth
as
the
first
herald
of
peace
and
hoist
this
banner
for
this
banner
will
be
hoisted
raise
it
aloft
for
you
are
the
most
qualified
and
deserving
of
nations
the
other
countries
await
this
summons
expect
this
call
to
the
standard
of
reconciliation
for
the
whole
world
is
distressed
because
of
the
excessive
burden
and
irreparable
damage
of
war
taxes
are
levied
to
meet
its
drain
every
year
the
burden
increases
and
the
people
have
come
to
their
end
just
now
europe
is
a
battlefield
of
ammunition
ready
for
a
spark
and
one
spark
will
set
aflame
the
whole
world
before
these
complications
and
cataclysmic
events
happen
take
the
step
to
prevent
it
the
foundations
of
all
the
divine
religions
are
peace
and
agreement
but
misunderstandings
and
ignorance
have
developed
if
these
are
caused
to
disappear
you
will
see
that
all
the
religious
agencies
will
work
for
peace
and
promulgate
the
oneness
of
humankind
for
the
foundation
of
all
is
reality
and
reality
is
not
multiple
or
divisible
his
holiness
moses
founded
it
his
holiness
jesus
raised
its
tent
and
its
brilliant
light
has
shone
forth
in
all
the
religions
his
holiness
bahaullah
proclaimed
this
one
reality
and
spread
the
message
of
the
most
great
peace
even
in
prison
he
rested
not
until
he
lighted
this
lamp
in
the
east
praise
be
to
god
all
who
have
accepted
his
teachings
are
lovers
of
peace
peacemakers
ready
to
sacrifice
their
lives
and
expend
their
possessions
for
it
now
let
this
standard
be
upraised
in
the
west
and
many
will
respond
to
the
call
america
has
become
renowned
for
her
discoveries
inventions
and
artistic
skill
famous
for
equity
of
government
and
stupendous
undertakings
now
may
she
also
become
noted
and
celebrated
as
the
herald
and
messenger
of
universal
peace
let
this
be
her
mission
and
undertaking
and
may
its
blessed
impetus
spread
to
all
countries
i
pray
for
all
of
you
that
you
may
render
this
service
to
the
world
of
humanity
foundations
of
world
unity
there
is
not
one
soul
whose
conscience
does
not
testify
that
in
this
day
there
is
no
more
important
matter
in
the
world
than
that
of
universal
peace
every
just
one
bears
witness
to
this
and
adores
that
esteemed
assembly
because
its
aim
is
that
this
darkness
may
be
turned
into
light
this
bloodthirstiness
into
kindness
this
torment
into
bliss
this
hardship
into
ease
and
this
enmity
and
hatred
into
fellowship
and
love
therefore
the
effort
of
those
esteemed
souls
is
worthy
of
praise
and
commendation
but
the
wise
souls
who
are
aware
of
the
essential
relationships
emanating
from
the
realities
of
things
consider
that
one
single
matter
cannot
by
itself
influence
the
human
reality
as
it
ought
and
should
for
until
the
minds
of
men
become
united
no
important
matter
can
be
accomplished
at
present
universal
peace
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
but
unity
of
conscience
is
essential
so
that
the
foundation
of
this
matter
may
become
secure
its
establishment
firm
and
its
edifice
strong
therefore
his
holiness
bahaullah
fifty
years
ago
expounded
this
question
of
universal
peace
at
a
time
when
he
was
confined
in
the
fortress
of
akka
and
was
wronged
and
imprisoned
he
wrote
about
this
matter
of
universal
peace
to
all
the
great
sovereigns
of
the
world
and
established
it
among
his
friends
in
the
orient
the
horizon
of
the
east
was
in
utter
darkness
nations
displayed
the
utmost
hatred
and
enmity
towards
each
other
religions
thirsted
for
each
others
blood
and
it
was
darkness
upon
darkness
at
such
a
time
his
holiness
bahaullah
shone
forth
like
the
sun
from
the
horizon
of
the
east
and
illumined
persia
with
the
light
of
these
teachings
among
his
teachings
was
the
declaration
of
universal
peace
people
of
different
nations
religions
and
sects
who
followed
him
came
together
to
such
an
extent
that
remarkable
gatherings
were
instituted
consisting
of
the
various
nations
and
religions
of
the
east
every
soul
who
entered
those
gatherings
saw
but
one
nation
one
pathway
one
teaching
one
order
for
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
were
not
limited
to
the
establishment
of
universal
peace
they
embraced
many
teachings
which
supplemented
and
supported
that
of
universal
peace
among
these
teachings
is
the
independent
investigation
of
reality
so
that
the
world
of
humanity
might
be
saved
from
the
darkness
of
imitation
and
attain
to
the
truth
might
tear
off
and
cast
away
this
ragged
and
outworn
garment
of
one
thousand
years
ago
and
put
on
the
robe
woven
in
the
utmost
purity
and
holiness
in
the
loom
of
reality
as
reality
is
one
and
cannot
admit
of
multiplicity
therefore
different
opinions
must
ultimately
become
fused
into
one
and
among
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
is
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
that
all
human
beings
are
the
sheep
of
god
and
he
is
the
kind
shepherd
this
shepherd
is
kind
to
all
the
sheep
because
he
created
them
all
trained
them
provided
for
them
and
protected
them
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
shepherd
is
kind
to
all
the
sheep
and
should
there
be
among
these
sheep
ignorant
ones
they
must
be
educated
if
there
be
children
they
must
be
trained
until
they
reach
maturity
if
there
be
sick
ones
they
must
be
healed
there
must
be
no
hatred
and
enmity
for
as
by
a
kind
physician
these
ignorant
sick
ones
should
be
treated
and
among
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
is
that
religion
must
be
the
cause
of
fellowship
and
love
if
it
becomes
the
cause
of
estrangement
then
it
is
not
needed
for
religion
is
like
a
remedy
if
it
aggravates
the
disease
then
it
becomes
unnecessary
and
among
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
is
that
religious
racial
political
economic
and
patriotic
prejudices
destroy
the
edifice
of
humanity
as
long
as
these
prejudices
prevail
the
world
of
humanity
will
have
no
rest
for
a
period
of
six
thousand
years
history
informs
us
about
the
world
of
humanity
during
these
six
thousand
years
the
world
of
humanity
has
not
been
free
from
war
strife
murder
and
bloodthirstiness
in
every
period
war
has
been
waged
in
one
country
or
another
and
that
war
was
due
to
either
religious
prejudice
racial
prejudice
political
prejudice
or
patriotic
prejudice
it
has
therefore
been
ascertained
and
proved
that
all
prejudices
are
destructive
of
the
human
edifice
as
long
as
these
prejudices
persist
the
struggle
for
existence
must
remain
dominant
and
bloodthirstiness
and
rapacity
continue
therefore
even
as
was
the
case
in
the
past
the
world
of
humanity
cannot
be
saved
from
the
darkness
of
nature
and
cannot
attain
illumination
except
through
the
abandonment
of
prejudices
and
the
acquisition
of
the
morals
of
the
kingdom
and
among
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
is
the
origination
of
one
language
that
may
be
spread
universally
among
the
people
this
teaching
was
revealed
from
the
pen
of
bahaullah
in
order
that
this
universal
language
may
eliminate
misunderstandings
from
among
mankind
and
among
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
is
the
equality
of
women
and
men
the
world
of
humanity
has
two
wings
one
is
woman
and
the
other
man
not
until
both
wings
are
equally
developed
can
the
bird
fly
should
one
wing
remain
weak
flight
is
impossible
not
until
the
world
of
woman
becomes
equal
to
the
world
of
man
in
the
acquisition
of
virtues
and
perfections
can
success
and
prosperity
be
attained
as
they
ought
to
be
and
among
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
is
voluntary
sharing
of
ones
property
with
others
among
mankind
this
voluntary
sharing
is
greater
than
equality
and
consists
in
this
that
man
should
not
prefer
himself
to
others
but
rather
should
sacrifice
his
life
and
property
for
others
but
this
should
not
be
introduced
by
coercion
so
that
it
becomes
a
law
and
man
is
compelled
to
follow
it
nay
rather
should
man
voluntarily
and
of
his
own
choice
sacrifice
his
property
and
life
for
others
and
spend
willingly
for
the
poor
just
as
is
done
in
persia
among
the
bahais
and
among
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
is
mans
freedom
that
through
the
ideal
power
he
should
be
emancipated
and
free
from
the
captivity
of
the
world
of
nature
for
as
long
as
man
is
captive
to
nature
he
is
a
ferocious
animal
as
the
struggle
for
existence
is
one
of
the
exigencies
of
the
world
of
nature
this
matter
of
the
struggle
for
existence
is
the
fountainhead
of
all
calamities
and
is
the
supreme
affliction
and
among
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
is
that
religion
is
a
mighty
bulwark
if
the
edifice
of
religion
shakes
and
totters
commotion
and
chaos
will
ensue
and
the
order
of
things
will
be
utterly
upset
for
in
the
world
of
mankind
there
are
two
safeguards
that
protect
man
from
wrongdoing
one
is
the
law
which
punishes
the
criminal
but
the
law
prevents
only
the
manifest
crime
and
not
the
concealed
sin
whereas
the
ideal
safeguard
namely
the
religion
of
god
prevents
both
the
manifest
and
the
concealed
crime
trains
man
educates
morals
compels
the
adoption
of
virtues
and
is
the
allinclusive
power
which
guarantees
the
felicity
of
the
world
of
mankind
but
by
religion
is
meant
that
which
is
ascertained
by
investigation
and
not
that
which
is
based
on
mere
imitation
the
foundation
of
divine
religions
and
not
human
imitations
and
among
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
is
that
although
material
civilization
is
one
of
the
means
for
the
progress
of
the
world
of
mankind
yet
until
it
becomes
combined
with
divine
civilization
the
desired
result
which
is
the
felicity
of
mankind
will
not
be
attained
consider
these
battleships
that
reduce
a
city
to
ruins
within
the
space
of
an
hour
are
the
result
of
material
civilization
likewise
the
krupp
guns
the
mauser
rifles
dynamite
submarines
torpedo
boats
armed
aircraft
and
bombing
aeroplanesall
these
weapons
of
war
are
malignant
fruits
of
material
civilization
had
material
civilization
been
combined
with
divine
civilization
these
fiery
weapons
would
never
have
been
invented
nay
rather
human
energy
would
have
been
wholly
devoted
to
useful
inventions
and
concentrated
on
praiseworthy
discoveries
material
civilization
is
like
a
globe
of
glass
divine
civilization
is
the
light
itself
and
the
glass
without
the
light
is
dark
material
civilization
is
like
the
body
no
matter
how
infinitely
graceful
elegant
and
beautiful
it
may
be
it
is
dead
divine
civilization
is
like
the
spirit
and
the
body
gets
its
life
from
the
spirit
otherwise
it
becomes
a
corpse
it
has
thus
been
made
evident
that
the
world
of
mankind
is
in
need
of
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
without
the
spirit
the
world
of
mankind
is
lifeless
and
without
this
light
the
world
of
mankind
is
in
utter
darkness
for
the
world
of
nature
is
an
animal
world
until
man
is
born
again
from
the
world
of
naturethat
is
to
say
becomes
detached
from
the
world
of
nature
he
is
essentially
an
animal
and
it
is
the
teachings
of
god
which
convert
this
animal
into
a
human
soul
and
among
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
is
the
promotion
of
education
every
child
must
be
instructed
in
sciences
as
much
as
is
necessary
if
the
parents
are
able
to
provide
the
expenses
of
this
education
it
is
all
right
otherwise
the
community
must
provide
the
means
for
the
teaching
of
that
child
and
among
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
are
justice
and
right
until
these
are
realized
on
the
plane
of
existence
all
things
will
be
in
disorder
and
remain
imperfect
the
world
of
mankind
is
a
world
of
oppression
and
cruelty
and
a
realm
of
aggression
and
error
in
fine
such
teachings
are
numerous
these
manifold
principles
which
constitute
the
greatest
basis
for
the
felicity
of
mankind
and
are
of
the
bounties
of
the
merciful
must
be
added
to
the
matter
of
universal
peace
and
combined
with
it
so
that
results
may
accrue
otherwise
the
realization
of
universal
peace
in
the
world
of
mankind
is
difficult
as
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
are
combined
with
universal
peace
they
are
like
a
table
provided
with
every
kind
of
fresh
and
delicious
food
every
soul
can
find
at
that
table
of
infinite
bounty
that
which
he
desires
if
the
question
is
restricted
to
universal
peace
alone
the
remarkable
results
which
are
expected
and
desired
will
not
be
attained
the
scope
of
universal
peace
must
be
such
that
all
the
communities
and
religions
may
find
their
highest
wish
realized
in
it
at
present
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
are
such
that
all
the
communities
of
the
world
whether
religious
political
or
ethical
ancient
or
modern
find
in
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
the
expression
of
their
highest
wish
for
example
the
people
of
religions
find
in
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
the
establishment
of
universal
religiona
religion
that
perfectly
conforms
with
present
conditions
which
in
reality
effects
the
immediate
cure
of
the
incurable
disease
which
relieves
every
pain
and
bestows
the
infallible
antidote
for
every
deadly
poison
for
if
we
wish
to
arrange
and
organize
the
world
of
mankind
in
accordance
with
the
present
religious
imitations
and
thereby
to
establish
the
felicity
of
mankind
it
is
impossible
and
impracticable
for
example
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
of
the
old
testament
and
also
of
the
other
religions
in
accordance
with
present
imitations
but
the
essential
basis
of
all
the
divine
religions
which
pertains
to
the
virtues
of
the
world
of
mankind
and
is
the
foundation
of
the
welfare
of
the
world
of
man
is
found
in
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
in
the
most
perfect
presentation
similarly
with
regard
to
the
people
who
clamor
for
freedom
the
moderate
freedom
which
guarantees
the
welfare
of
the
world
of
man
is
found
in
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
so
with
regard
to
political
parties
that
which
is
the
greatest
policy
directing
the
world
of
mankind
nay
rather
the
divine
policy
is
found
in
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
likewise
with
regard
to
the
party
of
equality
which
seeks
the
solution
of
the
economic
problems
until
now
all
proposed
solutions
have
proved
impracticable
except
the
economic
proposals
in
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
which
are
practicable
and
cause
no
distress
to
society
so
with
the
other
parties
when
ye
look
deeply
into
this
matter
ye
will
discover
that
the
highest
aims
of
those
parties
are
found
in
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
these
teachings
constitute
the
allinclusive
power
among
all
men
and
are
practicable
for
example
the
question
of
universal
peace
about
which
his
holiness
bahaullah
says
that
the
supreme
tribunal
must
be
established
although
the
league
of
nations
has
been
brought
into
existence
yet
it
is
incapable
of
establishing
universal
peace
but
the
supreme
tribunal
which
his
holiness
bahaullah
has
described
will
fulfill
this
sacred
task
with
the
utmost
might
and
power
and
his
plan
is
this
that
the
national
assemblies
of
each
country
and
nationthat
is
to
say
their
parliamentsshould
elect
two
or
three
persons
who
are
the
choicest
men
of
that
nation
and
are
well
informed
concerning
international
laws
and
the
relations
between
governments
and
aware
of
the
essential
needs
of
the
world
of
humanity
in
this
day
the
number
of
these
representatives
should
be
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
inhabitants
of
that
country
the
election
of
these
souls
who
are
chosen
by
the
national
assemblythat
is
the
parliamentmust
be
confirmed
by
the
upper
house
the
congress
and
the
cabinet
and
also
by
the
president
or
monarch
so
that
these
persons
may
be
the
elected
ones
of
all
the
nation
and
the
government
from
among
these
people
the
members
of
the
supreme
tribunal
will
be
elected
and
all
mankind
will
thus
have
a
share
therein
for
every
one
of
these
delegates
is
fully
representative
of
his
nation
when
the
supreme
tribunal
gives
a
ruling
on
any
international
question
either
unanimously
or
by
majority
rule
there
will
no
longer
be
any
pretext
for
the
plaintiff
or
ground
of
objection
for
the
defendant
in
case
any
of
the
governments
or
nations
in
the
execution
of
the
irrefutable
decision
of
the
supreme
tribunal
be
negligent
or
dilatory
the
rest
of
the
nations
will
rise
up
against
it
because
all
the
governments
and
nations
of
the
world
are
the
supporters
of
this
supreme
tribunal
consider
what
a
firm
foundation
this
is
but
by
a
limited
and
restricted
league
the
purpose
will
not
be
realized
as
it
ought
and
should
this
is
the
truth
about
the
situation
which
has
been
stated
today
nothing
but
the
power
of
the
word
of
god
which
encompasses
the
realities
of
things
can
bring
the
thoughts
minds
hearts
and
spirits
under
the
shade
of
one
tree
he
is
the
potent
in
all
things
the
vivifier
of
souls
the
preserver
and
the
controller
of
the
world
of
mankind
praise
be
to
god
in
this
day
the
light
of
the
word
of
god
has
shone
forth
upon
all
regions
and
from
all
sects
communities
nations
tribes
peoples
religions
and
denominations
souls
have
gathered
together
under
the
shadow
of
the
word
of
oneness
and
have
in
the
utmost
fellowship
united
and
harmonized
racial
harmony
today
i
am
most
happy
for
i
see
here
a
gathering
of
the
servants
of
god
i
see
the
white
and
colored
people
together
in
the
estimation
of
god
there
is
no
distinction
of
color
all
are
one
in
the
color
and
beauty
of
servitude
to
him
color
is
not
important
the
heart
is
allimportant
it
matters
not
what
the
exterior
may
be
if
the
heart
be
pure
and
white
within
god
does
not
behold
differences
of
hue
and
complexion
he
looks
at
the
hearts
he
whose
morals
and
virtues
are
praiseworthy
is
preferred
in
the
presence
of
god
he
who
is
devoted
to
the
kingdom
is
most
beloved
in
the
realm
of
genesis
and
creation
the
question
of
color
is
of
least
importance
the
mineral
kingdom
abounds
with
manycolored
substances
and
compositions
but
we
find
no
strife
among
them
on
that
account
in
the
kingdom
of
the
plant
and
vegetable
distinct
and
variegated
hues
exist
but
the
fruit
and
flowers
are
not
in
conflict
for
that
reason
nay
rather
the
very
fact
that
there
is
difference
and
variety
lends
a
charm
to
the
garden
if
all
were
of
the
same
color
the
effect
would
be
monotonous
and
depressing
when
you
enter
a
rosegarden
the
wealth
of
color
and
variety
of
floral
forms
spread
before
you
a
picture
of
wonder
and
beauty
the
world
of
humanity
is
like
a
garden
and
the
various
races
are
the
flowers
which
constitute
its
adornment
and
decoration
in
the
animal
kingdom
also
we
find
variety
of
color
see
how
the
doves
differ
in
beauty
yet
they
live
together
in
perfect
peace
and
love
each
other
they
do
not
make
difference
of
color
a
cause
of
discord
and
strife
they
view
each
other
as
the
same
species
and
kind
they
know
they
are
one
in
kind
often
a
white
dove
soars
aloft
with
a
black
one
throughout
the
animal
kingdom
we
do
not
find
the
creatures
separated
because
of
color
they
recognize
unity
of
species
and
oneness
of
kind
if
we
do
not
find
color
distinction
drawn
in
a
kingdom
of
lower
intelligence
and
reason
how
can
it
be
justified
among
human
beings
especially
when
we
know
that
all
have
come
from
the
same
source
and
belong
to
the
same
household
in
origin
and
intention
of
creation
mankind
is
one
distinctions
of
race
and
color
have
arisen
afterward
therefore
today
i
am
exceedingly
glad
that
both
white
and
colored
people
have
gathered
here
and
i
hope
the
time
will
come
when
they
shall
live
together
in
the
utmost
peace
unity
and
friendship
i
wish
to
say
one
thing
of
importance
to
both
in
order
that
the
white
race
may
be
just
and
kind
to
the
colored
and
that
the
colored
race
may
in
turn
be
grateful
and
appreciative
toward
the
white
the
great
proclamation
of
liberty
and
emancipation
from
slavery
was
made
upon
this
continent
a
long
bloody
war
was
fought
by
white
men
for
the
sake
of
colored
people
these
white
men
forfeited
their
possessions
and
sacrificed
their
lives
by
thousands
in
order
that
colored
men
might
be
freed
from
bondage
the
colored
population
of
the
united
states
of
america
are
possibly
not
fully
informed
of
the
widereaching
effect
of
this
freedom
and
emancipation
upon
their
colored
brethren
in
asia
and
africa
where
even
more
terrible
conditions
of
slavery
existed
influenced
and
impelled
by
the
example
of
the
united
states
the
european
powers
proclaimed
universal
liberty
to
the
colored
race
and
slavery
ceased
to
exist
this
effort
and
accomplishment
by
the
white
nations
should
never
be
lost
sight
of
both
races
should
rejoice
in
gratitude
for
the
institution
of
liberty
and
equality
here
became
the
cause
of
liberating
your
fellowbeings
elsewhere
the
colored
people
of
this
country
are
especially
fortunate
for
praise
be
to
god
conditions
here
are
so
much
higher
than
in
the
east
and
comparatively
few
differences
exist
in
the
possibility
of
equal
attainments
with
the
white
race
may
both
develop
toward
the
highest
degree
of
equality
and
altruism
may
you
be
drawn
together
in
friendship
and
may
extraordinary
development
make
brotherhood
a
reality
and
truth
i
pray
in
your
behalf
that
there
shall
be
no
name
other
than
that
of
humanity
among
you
therefore
strive
earnestly
and
put
forth
your
greatest
endeavor
toward
the
accomplishment
of
this
fellowship
and
the
cementing
of
this
bond
of
brotherhood
between
you
such
an
attainment
is
not
possible
without
will
and
effort
on
the
part
of
each
from
one
expressions
of
gratitude
and
appreciation
from
the
other
kindliness
and
recognition
of
equality
each
one
should
endeavor
to
develop
and
assist
the
other
toward
mutual
advancement
this
is
possible
only
by
conjoining
of
effort
and
inclination
love
and
unity
will
be
fostered
between
you
thereby
bringing
about
the
oneness
of
mankind
for
the
accomplishment
of
unity
between
the
colored
and
whites
will
be
an
assurance
of
the
worlds
peace
then
racial
prejudice
national
prejudice
limited
patriotism
and
religious
bias
will
pass
away
and
remain
no
longer
i
am
pleased
to
see
you
at
this
gathering
white
and
dark
and
i
praise
god
that
i
have
had
this
opportunity
of
seeing
you
loving
each
other
for
this
is
the
means
of
the
glory
of
humanity
this
is
the
means
of
the
goodpleasure
of
god
and
of
eternal
bliss
in
his
kingdom
therefore
i
pray
in
your
behalf
that
you
may
attain
to
the
fullest
of
love
and
that
the
day
may
come
when
all
differences
between
you
may
disappear
the
spirit
of
justice
what
could
be
better
before
god
than
thinking
of
the
poor
for
the
poor
are
beloved
by
our
heavenly
father
when
his
holiness
christ
came
upon
the
earth
those
who
believed
in
him
and
followed
him
were
the
poor
and
lowly
showing
the
poor
were
near
to
god
when
a
rich
man
believes
and
follows
the
manifestation
of
god
it
is
a
proof
that
his
wealth
is
not
an
obstacle
and
does
not
prevent
him
from
attaining
the
pathway
of
salvation
after
he
has
been
tested
and
tried
it
will
be
seen
whether
his
possessions
are
a
hindrance
in
his
religious
life
but
the
poor
are
especially
beloved
of
god
their
lives
are
full
of
difficulties
their
trials
continual
their
hopes
are
in
god
alone
therefore
you
must
assist
the
poor
as
much
as
possible
even
by
sacrifice
of
yourself
no
deed
of
man
is
greater
before
god
than
helping
the
poor
spiritual
conditions
are
not
dependent
upon
the
possession
of
worldly
treasures
or
the
absence
of
them
when
physically
destitute
spiritual
thoughts
are
more
likely
poverty
is
stimulus
toward
god
each
one
of
you
must
have
great
consideration
for
the
poor
and
render
them
assistance
organize
in
an
effort
to
help
them
and
prevent
increase
of
poverty
the
greatest
means
for
prevention
is
that
whereby
the
laws
of
the
community
will
be
so
framed
and
enacted
that
it
will
not
be
possible
for
a
few
to
be
millionaires
and
many
destitute
one
of
bahaullahs
teachings
is
the
adjustment
of
means
of
livelihood
in
human
society
under
this
adjustment
there
can
be
no
extremes
in
human
conditions
as
regards
wealth
and
sustenance
for
the
community
needs
financier
farmer
merchant
and
laborer
just
as
an
army
must
be
composed
of
commander
officers
and
privates
all
cannot
be
commanders
all
cannot
be
officers
or
privates
each
in
his
station
in
the
social
fabric
must
be
competent
each
in
his
function
according
to
ability
but
justness
of
opportunity
for
all
lycurgus
king
of
sparta
who
lived
long
before
the
day
of
christ
conceived
the
idea
of
absolute
equality
in
government
he
proclaimed
laws
by
which
all
the
people
of
sparta
were
classified
into
certain
divisions
each
division
had
its
separate
rights
and
function
first
farmers
and
tillers
of
the
soil
second
artisans
and
merchants
third
leaders
or
grandees
under
the
laws
of
lycurgus
the
latter
were
not
required
to
engage
in
any
labor
or
vocation
but
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
defend
the
country
in
case
of
war
and
invasion
then
he
divided
sparta
into
nine
thousand
equal
parts
or
provinces
appointing
nine
thousand
leaders
or
grandees
to
protect
them
in
this
way
the
farmers
of
each
province
were
assured
of
protection
but
each
farmer
was
compelled
to
pay
a
tax
to
support
the
grandee
of
that
province
the
farmers
and
merchants
were
not
obliged
to
defend
the
country
in
lieu
of
labor
the
grandees
received
the
taxes
lycurgus
in
order
to
establish
this
forever
as
a
law
brought
nine
thousand
grandees
together
told
them
he
was
going
upon
a
long
journey
and
wished
this
form
of
government
to
remain
effective
until
his
return
they
swore
an
oath
to
protect
and
preserve
his
law
he
then
left
his
kingdom
went
into
voluntary
exile
and
never
came
back
no
man
ever
made
such
a
sacrifice
to
insure
equality
among
his
fellowmen
a
few
years
passed
and
the
whole
system
of
government
he
had
founded
collapsed
although
established
upon
such
a
just
and
wise
basis
difference
of
capacity
in
human
individuals
is
fundamental
it
is
impossible
for
all
to
be
alike
all
to
be
equal
all
to
be
wise
bahaullah
has
revealed
principles
and
laws
which
will
accomplish
the
adjustment
of
varying
human
capacities
he
has
said
that
whatsoever
is
possible
of
accomplishment
in
human
government
will
be
effected
through
these
principles
when
the
laws
he
has
instituted
are
carried
out
there
will
be
no
millionaires
possible
in
the
community
and
likewise
no
extremely
poor
this
will
be
effected
and
regulated
by
adjusting
the
different
degrees
of
human
capacity
the
fundamental
basis
of
the
community
is
agriculture
tillage
of
the
soil
all
must
be
producers
each
person
in
the
community
whose
income
is
equal
to
his
individual
producing
capacity
shall
be
exempt
from
taxation
but
if
his
income
is
greater
than
his
needs
he
must
pay
a
tax
until
an
adjustment
is
effected
that
is
to
say
a
mans
capacity
for
production
and
his
needs
will
be
equalized
and
reconciled
through
taxation
if
his
production
exceeds
he
will
pay
no
tax
if
his
necessities
exceed
his
production
he
shall
receive
an
amount
sufficient
to
equalize
or
adjust
therefore
taxation
will
be
proportionate
to
capacity
and
production
and
there
will
be
no
poor
in
the
community
cooperation
it
seems
as
though
all
creatures
can
exist
singly
and
alone
for
example
a
tree
can
exist
solitary
and
alone
on
a
given
prairie
or
in
a
valley
or
on
the
mountainside
an
animal
upon
a
mountain
or
a
bird
soaring
in
the
air
might
live
a
solitary
life
they
are
not
in
need
of
cooperation
or
solidarity
such
animated
beings
enjoy
the
greatest
comfort
and
happiness
in
their
respective
solitary
lives
on
the
contrary
man
cannot
live
singly
and
alone
he
is
in
need
of
continuous
cooperation
and
mutual
help
for
example
a
man
living
alone
in
the
wilderness
will
eventually
starve
he
can
never
singly
and
alone
provide
himself
with
all
the
necessities
of
existence
therefore
he
is
in
need
of
cooperation
and
reciprocity
the
mystery
of
this
phenomenon
the
cause
thereof
is
this
that
mankind
has
been
created
from
one
single
origin
has
branched
off
from
one
family
thus
in
reality
all
mankind
represents
one
family
god
has
not
created
any
difference
he
has
created
all
as
one
that
thus
this
family
might
live
in
perfect
happiness
and
wellbeing
regarding
reciprocity
and
cooperation
each
member
of
the
body
politic
should
live
in
the
utmost
comfort
and
welfare
because
each
individual
member
of
humanity
is
a
member
of
the
body
politic
and
if
one
member
of
the
members
be
in
distress
or
be
afflicted
with
some
disease
all
the
other
members
must
necessarily
suffer
for
example
a
member
of
the
human
organism
is
the
eye
if
the
eye
should
be
affected
that
affliction
would
affect
the
whole
nervous
system
hence
if
a
member
of
the
body
politic
becomes
afflicted
in
reality
from
the
standpoint
of
sympathetic
connection
all
will
share
that
affliction
since
this
one
afflicted
is
a
member
of
the
group
of
members
a
part
of
the
whole
is
it
possible
for
one
member
or
part
to
be
in
distress
and
the
other
members
to
be
at
ease
it
is
impossible
hence
god
has
desired
that
in
the
body
politic
of
humanity
each
one
shall
enjoy
perfect
welfare
and
comfort
although
the
body
politic
is
one
family
yet
because
of
lack
of
harmonious
relations
some
members
are
comfortable
and
some
in
direst
misery
some
members
are
satisfied
and
some
are
hungry
some
members
are
clothed
in
most
costly
garments
and
some
families
are
in
need
of
food
and
shelter
why
because
this
family
lacks
the
necessary
reciprocity
and
symmetry
this
household
is
not
well
arranged
this
household
is
not
living
under
a
perfect
law
all
the
laws
which
are
legislated
do
not
ensure
happiness
they
do
not
provide
comfort
therefore
a
law
must
be
given
to
this
family
by
means
of
which
all
the
members
of
this
family
will
enjoy
equal
wellbeing
and
happiness
is
it
possible
for
one
member
of
a
family
to
be
subjected
to
the
utmost
misery
and
to
abject
poverty
and
for
the
rest
of
the
family
to
be
comfortable
it
is
impossible
unless
those
members
of
the
family
be
senseless
atrophied
inhospitable
unkind
then
they
would
say
though
these
members
do
belong
to
our
familylet
them
alone
let
us
look
after
ourselves
let
them
die
so
long
as
i
am
comfortable
i
am
honored
i
am
happythis
my
brotherlet
him
die
if
he
be
in
misery
let
him
remain
in
misery
so
long
as
i
am
comfortable
if
he
is
hungry
let
him
remain
so
i
am
satisfied
if
he
is
without
clothes
so
long
as
i
am
clothed
let
him
remain
as
he
is
if
he
is
shelterless
homeless
so
long
as
i
have
a
home
let
him
remain
in
the
wilderness
such
utter
indifference
in
the
human
family
is
due
to
lack
of
control
to
lack
of
a
working
law
to
lack
of
kindness
in
its
midst
if
kindness
had
been
shown
to
the
members
of
this
family
surely
all
the
members
thereof
would
have
enjoyed
comfort
and
happiness
his
holiness
bahaullah
has
given
instructions
regarding
every
one
of
the
questions
confronting
humanity
he
has
given
teachings
and
instructions
with
regard
to
every
one
of
the
problems
with
which
man
struggles
among
them
are
the
teachings
concerning
the
question
of
economics
that
all
the
members
of
the
body
politic
may
enjoy
through
the
working
out
of
this
solution
the
greatest
happiness
welfare
and
comfort
without
any
harm
or
injury
attacking
the
general
order
of
things
thereby
no
difference
or
dissension
will
occur
no
sedition
or
contention
will
take
place
this
solution
is
this
first
and
foremost
is
the
principle
that
to
all
the
members
of
the
body
politic
shall
be
given
the
greatest
achievements
of
the
world
of
humanity
each
one
shall
have
the
utmost
welfare
and
wellbeing
to
solve
this
problem
we
must
begin
with
the
farmer
there
will
we
lay
a
foundation
for
system
and
order
because
the
peasant
class
and
the
agricultural
class
exceed
other
classes
in
the
importance
of
their
service
in
every
village
there
must
be
established
a
general
storehouse
which
will
have
a
number
of
revenues
the
first
revenue
will
be
that
of
the
tenth
or
tithes
the
second
revenue
will
be
derived
from
the
animals
the
third
revenue
from
the
minerals
that
is
to
say
every
mine
prospected
or
discovered
a
third
thereof
will
go
to
this
vast
storehouse
the
fourth
is
this
whosoever
dies
without
leaving
any
heirs
all
his
heritage
will
go
to
the
general
storehouse
fifth
if
any
treasures
shall
be
found
on
the
land
they
should
be
devoted
to
this
storehouse
all
these
revenues
will
be
assembled
in
this
storehouse
as
to
the
first
the
tenths
or
tithes
we
will
consider
a
farmer
one
of
the
peasants
we
will
look
into
his
income
we
will
find
out
for
instance
what
is
his
annual
revenue
and
also
what
are
his
expenditures
now
if
his
income
be
equal
to
his
expenditures
from
such
a
farmer
nothing
whatever
will
be
taken
that
is
he
will
not
be
subjected
to
taxation
of
any
sort
needing
as
he
does
all
his
income
another
farmer
may
have
expenses
running
up
to
one
thousand
dollars
we
will
say
and
his
income
is
two
thousand
dollars
from
such
an
one
a
tenth
will
be
required
because
he
has
a
surplus
but
if
his
income
be
ten
thousand
dollars
and
his
expenses
one
thousand
dollars
or
his
income
twenty
thousand
dollars
he
will
have
to
pay
as
taxes
onefourth
if
his
income
be
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
his
expenses
five
thousand
onethird
will
he
have
to
pay
because
he
has
still
a
surplus
since
his
expenses
are
five
thousand
and
his
income
one
hundred
thousand
if
he
pays
say
thirtyfive
thousand
dollars
in
addition
to
the
expenditure
of
five
thousand
he
still
has
sixty
thousand
left
but
if
his
expenses
be
ten
thousand
and
his
income
two
hundred
thousand
then
he
must
give
an
even
half
because
ninety
thousand
will
be
in
that
case
the
sum
remaining
such
a
scale
as
this
will
determine
allotment
of
taxes
all
the
income
from
such
revenues
will
go
to
this
general
storehouse
then
there
must
be
considered
such
emergencies
as
follows
a
certain
farmer
whose
expenses
run
up
to
ten
thousand
dollars
and
whose
income
is
only
five
thousand
he
will
receive
necessary
expenses
from
the
storehouse
five
thousand
dollars
will
be
allotted
to
him
so
he
will
not
be
in
need
then
the
orphans
will
be
looked
after
all
of
whose
expenses
will
be
taken
care
of
the
cripples
in
the
villageall
their
expenses
will
be
looked
after
the
poor
in
the
villagetheir
necessary
expenses
will
be
defrayed
and
other
members
who
for
valid
reasons
are
incapacitatedthe
blind
the
old
the
deaftheir
comfort
must
be
looked
after
in
the
village
no
one
will
remain
in
need
or
in
want
all
will
live
in
the
utmost
comfort
and
welfare
yet
no
schism
will
assail
the
general
order
of
the
body
politic
hence
the
expenses
or
expenditures
of
the
general
storehouse
are
now
made
clear
and
its
activities
made
manifest
the
income
of
this
general
storehouse
has
been
shown
certain
trustees
will
be
elected
by
the
people
in
a
given
village
to
look
after
these
transactions
the
farmers
will
be
taken
care
of
and
if
after
all
these
expenses
are
defrayed
any
surplus
is
found
in
the
storehouse
it
must
be
transferred
to
the
national
treasury
this
system
is
all
thus
ordered
so
that
in
the
village
the
very
poor
will
be
comfortable
the
orphans
will
live
happily
and
well
in
a
word
no
one
will
be
left
destitute
all
the
individual
members
of
the
body
politic
will
thus
live
comfortably
and
well
for
larger
cities
naturally
there
will
be
a
system
on
a
larger
scale
were
i
to
go
into
that
solution
the
details
thereof
would
be
very
lengthy
the
result
of
this
system
will
be
that
each
individual
member
of
the
body
politic
will
live
most
comfortably
and
happily
under
obligation
to
no
one
nevertheless
there
will
be
preservation
of
degree
because
in
the
world
of
humanity
there
must
needs
be
degrees
the
body
politic
may
well
be
likened
to
an
army
in
this
army
there
must
be
a
general
there
must
be
a
sergeant
there
must
be
a
marshal
there
must
be
the
infantry
but
all
must
enjoy
the
greatest
comfort
and
welfare
god
is
not
partial
and
is
no
respecter
of
persons
he
has
made
provision
for
all
the
harvest
comes
forth
for
everyone
the
rain
showers
upon
everybody
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
is
destined
to
warm
everyone
the
verdure
of
the
earth
is
for
everyone
therefore
there
should
be
for
all
humanity
the
utmost
happiness
the
utmost
comfort
the
utmost
wellbeing
but
if
conditions
are
such
that
some
are
happy
and
comfortable
and
some
in
misery
some
are
accumulating
exorbitant
wealth
and
others
are
in
dire
wantunder
such
a
system
it
is
impossible
for
man
to
be
happy
and
impossible
for
him
to
win
the
good
pleasure
of
god
god
is
kind
to
all
the
good
pleasure
of
god
consists
in
the
welfare
of
all
the
individual
members
of
mankind
a
persian
king
was
one
night
in
his
palace
living
in
the
greatest
luxury
and
comfort
through
excessive
joy
and
gladness
he
addressed
a
certain
man
saying
of
all
my
life
this
is
the
happiest
moment
praise
be
to
god
from
every
point
prosperity
appears
and
fortune
smiles
my
treasury
is
full
and
the
army
is
well
taken
care
of
my
palaces
are
many
my
land
unlimited
my
family
is
well
off
my
honor
and
sovereignty
are
great
what
more
could
i
want
the
poor
man
at
the
gate
of
his
palace
spoke
out
saying
o
kind
king
assuming
that
you
are
from
every
point
of
view
so
happy
free
from
every
worry
and
sadnessdo
you
not
worry
for
us
you
say
that
on
your
own
account
you
have
no
worriesbut
do
you
never
worry
about
the
poor
in
your
land
is
it
becoming
or
meet
that
you
should
be
so
well
off
and
we
in
such
dire
want
and
need
in
view
of
our
needs
and
troubles
how
can
you
rest
in
your
palace
how
can
you
even
say
that
you
are
free
from
worries
and
sorrows
as
a
ruler
you
must
not
be
so
egoistic
as
to
think
of
yourself
alone
but
you
must
think
of
those
who
are
your
subjects
when
we
are
comfortable
then
you
will
be
comfortable
when
we
are
in
misery
how
can
you
as
a
king
be
in
happiness
the
purport
is
this
that
we
are
all
inhabiting
one
globe
of
earth
in
reality
we
are
one
family
and
each
one
of
us
is
a
member
of
this
family
we
must
all
be
in
the
greatest
happiness
and
comfort
under
a
just
rule
and
regulation
which
is
according
to
the
good
pleasure
of
god
thus
causing
us
to
be
happy
for
this
life
is
fleeting
if
man
were
to
care
for
himself
only
he
would
be
nothing
but
an
animal
for
only
the
animals
are
thus
egoistic
if
you
bring
a
thousand
sheep
to
a
well
to
kill
nine
hundred
and
ninetynine
the
one
remaining
sheep
would
go
on
grazing
not
thinking
of
the
others
and
worrying
not
at
all
about
the
lost
never
bothering
that
its
own
kind
had
passed
away
or
had
perished
or
been
killed
to
look
after
ones
self
only
is
therefore
an
animal
propensity
it
is
the
animal
propensity
to
live
solitary
and
alone
it
is
the
animal
proclivity
to
look
after
ones
own
comfort
but
man
was
created
to
be
a
manto
be
fair
to
be
just
to
be
merciful
to
be
kind
to
all
his
species
never
to
be
willing
that
he
himself
be
well
off
while
others
are
in
misery
and
distressthis
is
an
attribute
of
the
animal
and
not
of
man
nay
rather
man
should
be
willing
to
accept
hardships
for
himself
in
order
that
others
may
enjoy
wealth
he
should
enjoy
trouble
for
himself
that
others
may
enjoy
happiness
and
wellbeing
this
is
the
attribute
of
man
this
is
becoming
of
man
otherwise
man
is
not
manhe
is
less
than
the
animal
the
man
who
thinks
only
of
himself
and
is
thoughtless
of
others
is
undoubtedly
inferior
to
the
animal
because
the
animal
is
not
possessed
of
the
reasoning
faculty
the
animal
is
excused
but
in
man
there
is
reason
the
faculty
of
justice
the
faculty
of
mercifulness
possessing
all
these
faculties
he
must
not
leave
them
unused
he
who
is
so
hardhearted
as
to
think
only
of
his
own
comfort
such
an
one
will
not
be
called
man
man
is
he
who
forgets
his
own
interests
for
the
sake
of
others
his
own
comfort
he
forfeits
for
the
wellbeing
of
all
nay
rather
his
own
life
must
he
be
willing
to
forfeit
for
the
life
of
mankind
such
a
man
is
the
honor
of
the
world
of
humanity
such
a
man
is
the
glory
of
the
world
of
mankind
such
a
man
is
the
one
who
wins
eternal
bliss
such
a
man
is
near
to
the
threshold
of
god
such
a
man
is
the
very
manifestation
of
eternal
happiness
otherwise
men
are
like
animals
exhibiting
the
same
proclivities
and
propensities
as
the
world
of
animals
what
distinction
is
there
what
prerogatives
what
perfections
none
whatever
animals
are
better
eventhinking
only
of
themselves
and
negligent
of
the
needs
of
others
consider
how
the
greatest
men
in
the
worldwhether
among
prophets
or
philosophersall
have
forfeited
their
own
comfort
have
sacrificed
their
own
pleasure
for
the
wellbeing
of
humanity
they
have
sacrificed
their
own
lives
for
the
body
politic
they
have
sacrificed
their
own
wealth
for
that
of
the
general
welfare
they
have
forfeited
their
own
honor
for
the
honor
of
mankind
therefore
it
becomes
evident
that
this
is
the
highest
attainment
for
the
world
of
humanity
we
ask
god
to
endow
human
souls
with
justice
so
that
they
may
be
fair
and
may
strive
to
provide
for
the
comfort
of
all
that
each
member
of
humanity
may
pass
his
life
in
the
utmost
comfort
and
welfare
then
this
material
world
will
become
the
very
paradise
of
the
kingdom
this
elemental
earth
will
be
in
a
heavenly
state
and
all
the
servants
of
god
will
live
in
the
utmost
joy
happiness
and
gladness
we
must
all
strive
and
concentrate
all
our
thoughts
in
order
that
such
happiness
may
accrue
to
the
world
of
humanity
the
question
of
socialization
is
very
important
it
will
not
be
the
question
of
socialization
is
very
important
it
will
not
be
solved
by
strikes
for
wages
all
the
governments
of
the
world
must
be
united
and
organize
an
assembly
the
members
of
which
should
be
elected
from
the
parliaments
and
the
nobles
of
the
nations
these
must
plan
with
utmost
wisdom
and
power
so
that
neither
the
capitalist
suffer
from
enormous
losses
nor
the
laborers
become
needy
in
the
utmost
moderation
they
should
make
the
law
then
announce
to
the
public
that
the
rights
of
the
working
people
are
to
be
strongly
preserved
also
the
rights
of
the
capitalists
are
to
be
protected
when
such
a
general
plan
is
adopted
by
the
will
of
both
sides
should
a
strike
occur
all
the
governments
of
the
world
collectively
should
resist
it
otherwise
the
labor
problem
will
lead
to
much
destruction
especially
in
europe
terrible
things
will
take
place
for
instance
the
owners
of
properties
mines
and
factories
should
share
their
incomes
with
their
employees
and
give
a
fairly
certain
percentage
of
their
products
to
their
workingmen
in
order
that
the
employees
may
receive
beside
their
wages
some
of
the
general
income
of
the
factory
so
that
the
employee
may
strive
with
his
soul
in
the
work
no
more
trusts
will
remain
in
the
future
the
question
of
the
trusts
will
be
wiped
away
entirely
also
every
factory
that
has
ten
thousand
shares
will
give
two
thousand
shares
of
these
ten
thousand
to
its
employees
and
will
write
the
shares
in
their
names
so
that
they
may
have
them
and
the
rest
will
belong
to
the
capitalists
then
at
the
end
of
the
month
or
year
whatever
they
may
earn
after
the
expenses
and
wages
are
paid
according
to
the
number
of
shares
should
be
divided
among
both
in
reality
so
far
great
injustice
has
befallen
the
common
people
laws
must
be
made
because
it
is
impossible
for
the
laborers
to
be
satisfied
with
the
present
system
they
will
strike
every
month
and
every
year
finally
the
capitalists
will
lose
in
ancient
times
a
strike
occurred
among
the
turkish
soldiers
they
said
to
the
government
our
wages
are
very
small
and
they
should
be
increased
the
government
was
forced
to
give
them
their
demands
shortly
afterwards
they
struck
again
finally
all
the
incomes
went
to
the
pockets
of
the
soldiers
to
the
extent
that
they
killed
the
king
saying
why
didst
thou
not
increase
the
income
so
that
we
might
have
received
more
it
is
impossible
for
a
country
to
live
properly
without
laws
to
solve
this
problem
rigorous
laws
must
be
made
so
that
all
the
governments
of
the
world
will
be
the
protectors
thereof
in
the
bolshevistic
principles
equality
is
effected
through
force
the
masses
who
are
opposed
to
the
people
of
rank
and
to
the
wealthy
class
desire
to
partake
of
their
advantages
but
in
the
divine
teachings
equality
is
brought
about
through
a
ready
willingness
to
share
it
is
commanded
as
regards
wealth
that
the
rich
among
the
people
and
the
aristocrats
should
by
their
own
free
will
and
for
the
sake
of
their
own
happiness
concern
themselves
with
and
care
for
the
poor
this
equality
is
the
result
of
the
lofty
characteristics
and
noble
attributes
of
mankind
the
criterions
of
truth
during
my
visit
to
london
and
paris
last
year
i
had
many
talks
with
the
materialistic
philosophers
of
europe
the
basis
of
all
their
conclusions
is
that
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
of
phenomena
is
according
to
a
fixed
invariable
lawa
law
mathematically
exact
in
its
operation
through
the
senses
for
instance
the
eye
sees
a
chair
therefore
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
chairs
existence
the
eye
looks
up
into
the
heavens
and
beholds
the
sun
i
see
flowers
upon
this
table
i
smell
their
fragrance
i
hear
sounds
outside
etc
etc
this
they
say
is
a
fixed
mathematical
law
of
perception
and
deduction
the
operation
of
which
admits
of
no
doubt
whatever
for
inasmuch
as
the
universe
is
subject
to
our
sensing
the
proof
is
selfevident
that
our
knowledge
of
it
must
be
gained
through
the
avenues
of
the
senses
that
is
to
say
the
materialists
announce
that
the
criterion
and
standard
of
human
knowledge
is
sense
perception
among
the
greeks
and
romans
the
criterion
of
knowledge
was
reason
that
whatever
is
provable
and
acceptable
by
reason
must
necessarily
be
admitted
as
true
a
third
standard
or
criterion
is
the
opinion
held
by
theologians
that
traditions
or
prophetic
statement
and
interpretations
constitute
the
basis
of
human
knowing
there
is
still
another
a
fourth
criterion
upheld
by
religionists
and
metaphysicians
who
say
that
the
source
and
channel
of
all
human
penetration
into
the
unknown
is
through
inspiration
briefly
then
these
four
criterions
according
to
the
declarations
of
men
are
firstsense
perception
secondreason
thirdtraditions
fourthinspiration
in
europe
i
told
the
philosophers
and
scientists
of
materialism
that
the
criterion
of
the
senses
is
not
reliable
for
instance
consider
a
mirror
and
the
images
reflected
in
it
these
images
have
no
actual
corporeal
existence
yet
if
you
had
never
seen
a
mirror
you
would
firmly
insist
and
believe
that
they
were
real
the
eye
sees
a
mirage
upon
the
desert
as
a
lake
of
water
but
there
is
no
reality
in
it
as
we
stand
upon
the
deck
of
a
steamer
the
shore
appears
to
be
moving
yet
we
know
the
land
is
stationary
and
we
are
moving
the
earth
was
believed
to
be
fixed
and
the
sun
revolving
about
it
but
although
this
appears
to
be
so
the
reverse
is
now
known
to
be
true
a
whirling
torch
makes
a
circle
of
fire
appear
before
the
eye
yet
we
realize
there
is
but
one
point
of
light
we
behold
a
shadow
moving
upon
the
ground
but
it
has
no
material
existence
no
substance
in
deserts
the
atmospheric
effects
are
particularly
productive
of
illusions
which
deceive
the
eye
once
i
saw
a
mirage
in
which
a
whole
caravan
appeared
traveling
upward
into
the
sky
in
the
far
north
other
deceptive
phenomena
appear
and
baffle
human
vision
sometimes
three
or
four
suns
called
by
scientists
mock
suns
will
be
shining
at
the
same
time
whereas
we
know
the
great
solar
orb
is
one
and
that
it
remains
fixed
and
single
in
brief
the
senses
are
continually
deceived
and
we
are
unable
to
separate
that
which
is
reality
from
that
which
is
not
as
to
the
second
criterionreasonthis
likewise
is
unreliable
and
not
to
be
depended
upon
this
human
world
is
an
ocean
of
varying
opinions
if
reason
is
the
perfect
standard
and
criterion
of
knowledge
why
are
opinions
at
variance
and
why
do
philosophers
disagree
so
completely
with
each
other
this
is
a
clear
proof
that
human
reason
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
as
an
infallible
criterion
for
instance
great
discoveries
and
announcements
of
former
centuries
are
continually
upset
and
discarded
by
the
wise
men
of
today
mathematicians
astronomers
chemical
scientists
continually
disprove
and
reject
the
conclusions
of
the
ancients
nothing
is
fixed
nothing
final
everything
continually
changing
because
human
reason
is
progressing
along
new
roads
of
investigation
and
arriving
at
new
conclusions
every
day
in
the
future
much
that
is
announced
and
accepted
as
true
now
will
be
rejected
and
disproved
and
so
it
will
continue
ad
infinitum
when
we
consider
the
third
criteriontraditionsupheld
by
theologians
as
the
avenue
and
standard
of
knowledge
we
find
this
source
equally
unreliable
and
unworthy
of
dependence
for
religious
traditions
are
the
report
and
record
of
understanding
and
interpretation
of
the
book
by
what
means
has
this
understanding
this
interpretation
been
reached
by
the
analysis
of
human
reason
when
we
read
the
book
of
god
the
faculty
of
comprehension
by
which
we
form
conclusions
is
reason
reason
is
mind
if
we
are
not
endowed
with
perfect
reason
how
can
we
comprehend
the
meanings
of
the
word
of
god
therefore
human
reason
as
already
pointed
out
is
by
its
very
nature
finite
and
faulty
in
conclusions
it
cannot
surround
the
reality
itself
the
infinite
word
inasmuch
as
the
source
of
traditions
and
interpretations
is
human
reason
and
human
reason
is
faulty
how
can
we
depend
upon
its
findings
for
real
knowledge
the
fourth
criterion
i
have
named
is
inspiration
through
which
it
is
claimed
the
reality
of
knowledge
is
attainable
what
is
inspiration
it
is
the
influx
of
the
human
heart
but
what
are
satanic
promptings
which
afflict
mankind
they
are
the
influx
of
the
heart
also
how
shall
we
differentiate
between
them
the
question
arises
how
shall
we
know
whether
we
are
following
inspiration
from
god
or
satanic
promptings
of
the
human
soul
briefly
the
point
is
that
in
the
human
material
world
of
phenomena
these
four
are
the
only
existing
criterions
or
avenues
of
knowledge
and
all
of
them
are
faulty
and
unreliable
what
then
remains
how
shall
we
attain
the
reality
of
knowledge
by
the
breaths
and
promptings
of
the
holy
spirit
which
is
light
and
knowledge
itself
through
it
the
human
mind
is
quickened
and
fortified
into
true
conclusions
and
perfect
knowledge
this
is
conclusive
argument
showing
that
all
available
human
criterions
are
erroneous
and
defective
but
the
divine
standard
of
knowledge
is
infallible
therefore
man
is
not
justified
in
saying
i
know
because
i
perceive
through
my
senses
or
i
know
because
it
is
proved
through
my
faculty
of
reason
or
i
know
because
it
is
according
to
tradition
and
interpretation
of
the
holy
book
or
i
know
because
i
am
inspired
all
human
standard
of
judgment
is
faulty
finite
man
and
nature
if
we
look
with
a
perceiving
eye
upon
the
world
of
creation
we
find
that
all
existing
things
may
be
classified
as
follows
firstmineralthat
is
to
say
matter
or
substance
appearing
in
various
forms
of
composition
secondvegetablepossessing
the
virtues
of
the
mineral
plus
the
power
of
augmentation
or
growth
indicating
a
degree
higher
and
more
specialized
than
the
mineral
thirdanimalpossessing
the
attributes
of
the
mineral
and
vegetable
plus
the
power
of
sense
perception
fourthhumanthe
highest
specialized
organism
of
visible
creation
embodying
the
qualities
of
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
plus
an
ideal
endowment
absolutely
minus
and
absent
in
the
lower
kingdomsthe
power
of
intellectual
investigation
into
the
mysteries
of
outer
phenomena
the
outcome
of
this
intellectual
endowment
is
science
which
is
especially
characteristic
of
man
this
scientific
power
investigates
and
apprehends
created
objects
and
the
laws
surrounding
them
it
is
the
discoverer
of
the
hidden
and
mysterious
secrets
of
the
material
universe
and
is
peculiar
to
man
alone
the
most
noble
and
praiseworthy
accomplishment
of
man
therefore
is
scientific
knowledge
and
attainment
science
may
be
likened
to
a
mirror
wherein
the
images
of
the
mysteries
of
outer
phenomena
are
reflected
it
brings
forth
and
exhibits
to
us
in
the
arena
of
knowledge
all
the
product
of
the
past
it
links
together
past
and
present
the
philosophical
conclusions
of
bygone
centuries
the
teachings
of
the
prophets
and
wisdom
of
former
sages
are
crystallized
and
reproduced
in
the
scientific
advancement
of
today
science
is
the
discoverer
of
the
past
from
its
premises
of
past
and
present
we
deduce
conclusions
as
to
the
future
science
is
the
governor
of
nature
and
its
mysteries
the
one
agency
by
which
man
explores
the
institutions
of
material
creation
all
created
things
are
captives
of
nature
and
subject
to
its
laws
they
cannot
transgress
the
control
of
these
laws
in
one
detail
or
particular
the
infinite
starry
worlds
and
heavenly
bodies
are
natures
obedient
subjects
the
earth
and
its
myriad
organisms
all
minerals
plants
and
animals
are
thralls
of
its
dominion
but
man
through
the
exercise
of
his
scientific
intellectual
power
can
rise
out
of
this
condition
can
modify
change
and
control
nature
according
to
his
own
wishes
and
uses
science
so
to
speak
is
the
breaker
of
the
laws
of
nature
consider
for
example
that
man
according
to
natural
law
should
dwell
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
by
overcoming
this
law
and
restriction
however
he
sails
in
ships
over
the
ocean
mounts
to
the
zenith
in
aeroplanes
and
sinks
to
the
depths
of
the
sea
in
submarines
this
is
against
the
fiat
of
nature
and
a
violation
of
her
sovereignty
and
dominion
natures
laws
and
methods
the
hidden
secrets
and
mysteries
of
the
universe
human
inventions
and
discoveries
all
our
scientific
acquisitions
should
naturally
remain
concealed
and
unknown
but
man
through
his
intellectual
acumen
searches
them
out
of
the
plane
of
the
invisible
draws
them
into
the
plane
of
the
visible
exposes
and
explains
them
for
instance
one
of
the
mysteries
of
nature
is
electricity
according
to
nature
this
force
this
energy
should
remain
latent
and
hidden
but
man
scientifically
breaks
through
the
very
laws
of
nature
arrests
it
and
even
imprisons
it
for
his
use
in
brief
man
through
the
possession
of
this
ideal
endowment
of
scientific
investigation
is
the
most
noble
product
of
creation
the
governor
of
nature
he
takes
the
sword
from
natures
hand
and
uses
it
upon
natures
head
according
to
natural
law
night
is
a
period
of
darkness
and
obscurity
but
man
by
utilizing
the
power
of
electricity
by
wielding
this
electric
sword
overcomes
the
darkness
and
dispels
the
gloom
man
is
superior
to
nature
and
makes
nature
do
his
bidding
man
is
a
sensitive
being
nature
is
minus
sensation
man
has
memory
and
reason
nature
lacks
them
man
is
nobler
than
nature
there
are
powers
within
him
of
which
nature
is
devoid
it
may
be
claimed
that
these
powers
are
from
nature
itself
and
that
man
is
a
part
of
nature
in
answer
to
this
statement
we
will
say
that
if
nature
is
the
whole
and
man
is
a
part
of
that
whole
how
could
it
be
possible
for
a
part
to
possess
qualities
and
virtues
which
are
absent
in
the
whole
undoubtedly
the
part
must
be
endowed
with
the
same
qualities
and
properties
as
the
whole
for
example
the
hair
is
a
part
of
the
human
anatomy
it
cannot
contain
elements
which
are
not
found
in
other
parts
of
the
body
for
in
all
cases
the
component
elements
of
the
body
are
the
same
therefore
it
is
manifest
and
evident
that
man
although
in
body
a
part
of
nature
nevertheless
in
spirit
possesses
a
power
transcending
nature
for
if
he
were
simply
a
part
of
nature
and
limited
to
material
laws
he
could
possess
only
the
things
which
nature
embodies
god
has
conferred
upon
and
added
to
man
a
distinctive
power
the
faculty
of
intellectual
investigation
into
the
secrets
of
creation
the
acquisition
of
higher
knowledge
the
greatest
virtue
of
which
is
scientific
enlightenment
this
endowment
is
the
most
praiseworthy
power
of
man
for
through
its
employment
and
exercise
the
betterment
of
the
human
race
is
accomplished
the
development
of
the
virtues
of
mankind
is
made
possible
and
the
spirit
and
mysteries
of
god
become
manifest
as
material
and
physical
sciences
are
taught
here
and
are
constantly
unfolding
in
wider
vistas
of
attainment
i
am
hopeful
that
spiritual
development
may
also
follow
and
keep
pace
with
these
outer
advantages
as
material
knowledge
is
illuminating
those
within
the
walls
of
this
great
temple
of
learning
so
also
may
the
light
of
the
spirit
the
inner
and
divine
light
of
the
real
philosophy
glorify
this
institution
the
most
important
principle
of
divine
philosophy
is
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
unity
of
mankind
the
bond
conjoining
east
and
west
the
tie
of
love
which
blends
human
hearts
therefore
it
is
our
duty
to
put
forth
our
greatest
efforts
and
summon
all
our
energies
in
order
that
the
bonds
of
unity
and
accord
may
be
established
among
mankind
for
thousands
of
years
we
have
had
bloodshed
and
strife
it
is
enough
it
is
sufficient
now
is
the
time
to
associate
together
in
love
and
harmony
for
thousands
of
years
we
have
tried
the
sword
and
warfare
let
mankind
for
a
time
at
least
live
in
peace
review
history
and
consider
how
much
savagery
how
much
bloodshed
and
battle
the
world
has
witnessed
it
has
been
either
religious
warfare
political
warfare
or
some
other
clash
of
human
interests
the
world
of
humanity
has
never
enjoyed
the
blessing
of
universal
peace
year
by
year
the
implements
of
warfare
have
been
increased
and
perfected
consider
the
wars
of
past
centuries
only
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
at
the
most
were
killed
but
now
it
is
possible
to
kill
one
hundred
thousand
in
a
single
day
in
ancient
times
warfare
was
carried
on
with
the
sword
today
it
is
the
smokeless
gun
formerly
battleships
were
sailing
vessels
today
they
are
dreadnoughts
consider
the
increase
and
improvement
in
the
weapons
of
war
god
has
created
us
all
human
and
all
countries
of
the
world
are
parts
of
the
same
globe
we
are
all
his
servants
he
is
kind
and
just
to
all
why
should
we
be
unkind
and
unjust
to
each
other
he
provides
for
all
why
should
we
deprive
one
another
he
protects
and
preserves
all
why
should
we
kill
our
fellowcreatures
if
this
warfare
and
strife
be
for
the
sake
of
religion
it
is
evident
that
it
violates
the
spirit
and
basis
of
all
religion
all
the
divine
manifestations
have
proclaimed
the
oneness
of
god
and
the
unity
of
mankind
they
have
taught
that
men
should
love
and
mutually
help
each
other
in
order
that
they
might
progress
now
if
this
conception
of
religion
be
true
its
essential
principle
is
the
oneness
of
humanity
the
fundamental
truth
of
the
manifestations
is
peace
this
underlies
all
religion
all
justice
the
divine
purpose
is
that
men
should
live
in
unity
concord
and
agreement
and
should
love
one
another
consider
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
and
realize
that
the
oneness
of
humanity
is
the
primary
foundation
of
them
all
read
the
gospel
and
the
other
holy
books
you
will
find
their
fundamentals
are
one
and
the
same
the
microcosm
and
the
macrocosm
when
we
ponder
over
the
reality
of
the
microcosm
we
discover
that
in
the
microcosm
there
are
deposited
three
realities
man
is
endowed
with
an
outer
or
physical
reality
it
belongs
to
the
material
realm
the
animal
kingdom
because
it
has
sprung
from
the
material
world
this
animalistic
reality
of
man
he
shares
in
common
with
the
animals
the
human
body
is
like
animals
subject
to
natures
laws
but
man
is
endowed
with
a
second
reality
the
rational
or
intellectual
reality
and
the
intellectual
reality
of
man
predominates
over
nature
all
these
sciences
which
we
enjoy
were
the
hidden
and
recondite
secrets
of
nature
unknowable
to
nature
but
man
was
enabled
to
discover
these
mysteries
and
out
of
the
plane
of
the
unseen
he
brought
them
into
the
plane
of
the
seen
yet
there
is
a
third
reality
in
man
the
spiritual
reality
through
its
medium
one
discovers
spiritual
revelations
a
celestial
faculty
which
is
infinite
as
regards
the
intellectual
as
well
as
physical
realms
that
power
is
conferred
upon
man
through
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
it
is
an
eternal
reality
an
indestructible
reality
a
reality
belonging
to
the
divine
supernatural
kingdom
a
reality
whereby
the
world
is
illumined
a
reality
which
grants
unto
man
eternal
life
this
third
spiritual
reality
it
is
which
discovers
past
events
and
looks
along
the
vistas
of
the
future
it
is
the
ray
of
the
sun
of
reality
the
spiritual
world
is
enlightened
through
it
the
whole
of
the
kingdom
is
being
illumined
by
it
it
enjoys
the
world
of
beatitude
a
world
which
had
not
beginning
and
which
shall
have
no
end
that
celestial
reality
the
third
reality
of
the
microcosm
delivers
man
from
the
material
world
its
power
causes
man
to
escape
from
natures
world
escaping
he
will
find
an
illuminating
reality
transcending
the
limited
reality
of
man
and
causing
him
to
attain
to
the
infinitude
of
god
abstracting
him
from
the
world
of
superstitions
and
imaginations
and
submerging
him
in
the
sea
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
this
fact
is
proved
from
scientific
as
well
as
spiritual
evidence
when
we
ponder
over
the
conditions
of
phenomena
we
observe
that
all
phenomena
are
composed
of
single
elements
this
singular
cellelement
travels
and
has
its
coursings
through
all
the
grades
of
existence
i
wish
you
to
ponder
carefully
over
this
this
cellular
element
has
at
some
time
been
in
the
mineral
kingdom
while
staying
in
the
mineral
kingdom
it
has
had
its
coursings
and
transformations
through
myriads
of
images
and
forms
having
perfected
its
journey
in
the
mineral
kingdom
it
has
ascended
to
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
it
has
again
had
journeys
and
transformations
through
myriads
of
conditions
having
accomplished
its
functions
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
the
cellular
element
ascends
to
the
animal
kingdom
in
the
animal
kingdom
again
it
goes
through
the
composition
of
myriads
of
images
and
then
we
have
it
in
the
human
kingdom
in
the
human
kingdom
likewise
it
has
its
transformations
and
coursings
through
multitudes
of
forms
in
short
this
single
primordial
atom
has
had
its
great
journeys
through
every
stage
of
life
and
in
every
stage
it
was
endowed
with
a
special
and
particular
virtue
or
characteristic
consequently
the
great
divine
philosophers
have
had
the
following
epigram
all
things
are
involved
in
all
things
for
every
single
phenomenon
has
enjoyed
the
postulates
of
god
and
in
every
form
of
these
infinite
electrons
it
has
had
its
characteristics
of
perfection
thus
this
flower
once
upon
a
time
was
of
the
soil
the
animal
eats
the
flower
or
its
fruit
and
it
thereby
ascends
to
the
animal
kingdom
man
eats
the
meat
of
the
animal
and
there
you
have
its
ascent
into
the
human
kingdom
because
all
phenomena
are
divided
into
that
which
eats
and
that
which
is
eaten
therefore
every
primordial
atom
of
these
atoms
singly
and
indivisible
has
had
its
coursings
throughout
all
the
sentient
creation
going
constantly
into
the
aggregation
of
the
various
elements
hence
do
you
have
the
conservation
of
energy
and
the
infinity
of
phenomena
the
indestructibility
of
phenomena
changeless
and
immutable
because
life
cannot
suffer
annihilation
but
only
change
the
apparent
annihilation
is
this
that
the
form
the
outward
image
goes
through
all
these
changes
and
transformations
let
us
again
take
the
example
of
this
flower
the
flower
is
indestructible
the
only
thing
that
we
can
see
this
outer
form
is
indeed
destroyed
but
the
elements
the
indivisible
elements
which
have
gone
into
the
composition
of
this
flower
are
eternal
and
changeless
therefore
the
realities
of
all
phenomena
are
immutable
extinction
or
mortality
is
nothing
but
the
transformation
of
pictures
and
images
so
to
speakthe
reality
back
of
these
images
is
eternal
and
every
reality
of
the
realities
is
one
of
the
bounties
of
god
some
people
believe
that
the
divinity
of
god
had
a
beginning
they
say
that
before
this
particular
beginning
man
had
no
knowledge
of
the
divinity
of
god
with
this
principle
they
have
limited
the
operation
of
the
influences
of
god
for
example
they
think
there
was
a
time
when
man
did
not
exist
and
that
there
will
be
a
time
in
the
future
when
man
will
not
exist
such
a
theory
circumscribes
the
power
of
god
because
how
can
we
understand
the
divinity
of
god
except
through
scientifically
understanding
the
manifestations
of
the
attributes
of
god
how
can
we
understand
the
nature
of
fire
except
from
its
heat
its
light
were
not
heat
and
light
in
this
fire
naturally
we
could
not
say
that
the
fire
existed
thus
if
there
was
a
time
when
god
did
not
manifest
his
qualities
then
there
was
no
god
because
the
attributes
of
god
presuppose
the
creation
of
phenomena
for
example
by
present
consideration
we
say
that
god
is
the
creator
then
there
must
always
have
been
a
creationsince
the
quality
of
creator
cannot
be
limited
to
the
moment
when
some
man
or
men
realize
this
attribute
the
attributes
that
we
discover
one
by
onethese
attributes
themselves
necessarily
anticipated
our
discovery
of
them
therefore
god
has
no
beginning
and
no
ending
nor
is
his
creation
limited
ever
as
to
degree
limitations
of
time
and
degree
pertain
to
things
created
never
to
the
creation
as
a
whole
they
pertain
to
the
forms
of
things
not
to
their
realities
the
effulgence
of
god
cannot
be
suspended
the
sovereignty
of
god
cannot
be
interrupted
as
long
as
the
sovereignty
of
god
is
immemorial
therefore
the
creation
of
our
world
throughout
infinity
is
presupposed
when
we
look
at
the
reality
of
this
subject
we
see
that
the
bounties
of
god
are
infinite
without
beginning
and
without
end
the
greatest
bounties
of
god
in
this
phenomenal
world
are
his
manifestations
this
is
the
greatest
postulate
these
manifestations
are
the
suns
of
reality
for
it
is
through
the
manifestation
that
the
reality
becomes
known
and
established
for
man
history
proves
to
us
that
apart
from
the
influence
of
the
manifestations
man
sinks
back
into
his
animal
condition
using
even
his
intellectual
power
to
subserve
an
animal
purpose
therefore
there
is
no
cessation
whatsoever
in
the
future
for
the
appearance
of
the
manifestation
of
god
because
god
is
infinite
and
his
purpose
cannot
be
limited
in
any
way
if
we
ever
dare
to
limit
and
circumscribe
gods
purpose
within
any
bounds
then
of
necessity
we
have
dared
to
set
limitations
to
the
omnipotence
of
god
the
created
has
dared
to
define
his
creator
consequently
the
perfect
man
ever
beholds
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
truth
the
perfect
man
ever
awaits
and
expects
the
coming
of
the
effulgence
of
god
he
ever
ponders
over
the
methods
and
purposes
of
god
knowing
that
of
certainty
the
realities
of
the
divine
are
not
finite
the
divine
names
and
attributes
are
not
finite
gods
graces
and
bounties
are
without
limit
and
the
coming
of
the
manifestations
of
god
are
not
circumscribed
by
time
the
universal
cycles
each
one
of
the
luminous
bodies
in
this
limitless
firmament
has
a
cycle
of
revolution
which
is
of
a
different
duration
and
every
one
revolves
in
its
own
orbit
and
again
begins
a
new
cycle
so
the
earth
every
three
hundred
and
sixtyfive
days
five
hours
fortyeight
minutes
and
a
fraction
completes
a
revolution
and
then
it
begins
a
new
cycle
that
is
to
say
the
first
cycle
is
again
renewed
in
the
same
way
for
the
whole
universe
whether
for
the
heavens
or
for
men
there
are
cycles
of
great
events
of
important
facts
and
occurrences
when
a
cycle
is
ended
a
new
cycle
begins
and
the
old
one
on
account
of
the
great
events
which
take
place
is
completely
forgotten
and
not
a
trace
or
record
of
it
will
remain
as
you
see
we
have
no
records
of
twenty
thousand
years
ago
although
we
have
before
proved
by
argument
that
life
on
this
earth
is
very
ancient
it
is
not
one
hundred
thousand
or
two
hundred
thousand
or
one
million
or
two
million
years
old
it
is
very
ancient
and
the
ancient
records
and
traces
are
entirely
obliterated
each
of
the
divine
manifestations
has
likewise
a
cycle
and
during
the
cycle
his
laws
and
commandments
prevail
and
are
performed
when
his
cycle
is
completed
by
the
appearance
of
a
new
manifestation
a
new
cycle
begins
in
this
way
cycles
begin
end
and
are
renewed
until
a
universal
cycle
is
completed
in
the
world
when
important
events
and
great
occurrences
will
take
place
which
entirely
efface
every
trace
and
every
record
of
the
past
then
a
new
universal
cycle
begins
in
the
world
for
this
universe
has
no
beginning
we
have
before
stated
proofs
and
evidences
concerning
this
subject
there
is
no
need
of
repetition
briefly
we
say
a
universal
cycle
in
the
world
of
existence
signifies
a
long
duration
of
time
and
innumerable
and
incalculable
periods
and
epochs
in
such
a
cycle
the
manifestations
appear
with
splendor
in
the
realm
of
the
visible
until
a
great
and
universal
manifestation
makes
the
world
the
center
of
his
radiance
his
appearance
causes
the
world
to
attain
to
maturity
and
the
extension
of
his
cycle
is
very
great
afterwards
other
manifestations
will
arise
under
his
shadow
who
according
to
the
needs
of
the
time
will
renew
certain
commandments
relating
to
material
questions
and
affairs
while
remaining
under
his
shadow
we
are
in
the
cycle
which
began
with
adam
and
its
universal
manifestation
is
bahaullah
education
according
to
the
statement
of
philosophers
the
difference
in
degree
of
humankind
from
lowest
to
highest
is
due
to
education
the
proofs
they
advance
are
these
the
civilization
of
europe
and
america
is
an
evidence
and
outcome
of
education
whereas
the
semicivilized
and
barbarous
peoples
of
africa
bear
witness
in
their
condition
that
they
have
been
deprived
of
its
advantages
education
makes
the
ignorant
wise
the
tyrant
just
promotes
happiness
strengthens
the
mind
develops
the
will
and
makes
fruitless
trees
of
humanity
fruitful
therefore
in
the
human
world
some
have
attained
lofty
degrees
while
others
grope
in
the
abyss
of
despair
nevertheless
the
highest
attainment
is
possible
for
every
member
of
the
human
race
even
to
the
station
of
the
prophets
this
is
the
statement
and
reasoning
of
the
philosophers
the
prophets
of
god
are
the
first
educators
they
bestow
universal
education
upon
man
and
cause
him
to
rise
from
lowest
levels
of
savagery
to
the
highest
pinnacles
of
spiritual
development
the
philosophers
too
are
educators
along
lines
of
intellectual
training
at
most
they
have
only
been
able
to
educate
themselves
and
a
limited
number
about
them
to
improve
their
own
morals
and
so
to
speak
civilize
themselves
but
they
have
been
incapable
of
universal
education
they
have
failed
to
cause
an
advancement
for
any
given
nation
from
savagery
to
civilization
it
is
evident
that
although
education
improves
the
morals
of
mankind
confers
the
advantages
of
civilization
and
elevates
man
from
lowest
degrees
to
the
station
of
sublimity
there
is
nevertheless
a
difference
in
the
intrinsic
or
natal
capacity
of
individuals
ten
children
of
the
same
age
with
equal
station
of
birth
taught
in
the
same
school
partaking
of
the
same
food
in
all
respects
subject
to
the
same
environment
their
interests
equal
and
in
common
will
evidence
separate
and
distinct
degrees
of
capability
and
advancement
some
exceedingly
intelligent
and
progressive
some
of
mediocre
ability
others
limited
and
incapable
one
may
become
a
learned
professor
while
another
under
the
same
course
of
education
proves
dull
and
stupid
from
all
standpoints
the
opportunities
have
been
equal
but
the
results
and
outcomes
vary
from
the
highest
to
lowest
degree
of
advancement
it
is
evident
therefore
that
mankind
differs
in
natal
capacity
and
intrinsic
intellectual
endowment
nevertheless
although
capacities
are
not
the
same
every
member
of
the
human
race
is
capable
of
education
his
holiness
jesus
christ
was
an
educator
of
humanity
his
teachings
were
altruistic
his
bestowal
universal
he
taught
mankind
by
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
and
not
through
human
agency
for
the
human
power
is
limited
whereas
the
divine
power
is
illimitable
and
infinite
the
influence
and
accomplishment
of
christ
will
attest
this
galen
the
greek
physician
and
philosopher
who
lived
in
the
second
century
ad
wrote
a
treatise
upon
the
civilization
of
nations
he
was
not
a
christian
but
he
has
borne
testimony
that
religious
beliefs
exercise
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
the
problems
of
civilization
in
substance
he
says
there
are
certain
people
among
us
followers
of
jesus
the
nazarene
who
was
killed
in
jerusalem
these
people
are
truly
imbued
with
moral
principles
which
are
the
envy
of
philosophers
they
believe
in
god
and
fear
him
they
have
hopes
in
his
favors
therefore
they
shun
all
unworthy
deeds
and
actions
and
incline
to
praiseworthy
ethics
and
morals
day
and
night
they
strive
that
their
deeds
may
be
commendable
and
that
they
may
contribute
to
the
welfare
of
humanity
therefore
each
one
of
them
is
virtually
a
philosopher
for
these
people
have
attained
unto
that
which
is
the
essence
and
purport
of
philosophy
these
people
have
praiseworthy
morals
even
though
they
may
be
illiterate
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
show
that
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
the
divine
prophets
are
the
first
teachers
of
the
human
race
they
are
universal
educators
and
the
fundamental
principles
they
have
laid
down
are
the
causes
and
factors
of
the
advancement
of
nations
the
holy
spirit
the
elemental
atoms
which
constitute
all
phenomenal
existence
and
being
in
this
illimitable
universe
are
in
perpetual
motion
undergoing
continuous
degrees
of
progression
for
instance
let
us
conceive
of
an
atom
in
the
mineral
kingdom
progressing
upward
to
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
by
entering
into
the
composition
and
fibre
of
a
tree
or
plant
from
thence
it
is
assimilated
and
transferred
into
the
kingdom
of
the
animal
and
finally
by
the
law
and
process
of
composition
becomes
a
part
of
the
body
of
man
that
is
to
say
it
has
traversed
the
intermediate
degrees
and
stations
of
phenomenal
existence
entering
into
the
composition
of
various
organisms
in
its
journey
this
motion
or
transference
is
progressive
and
perpetual
for
after
disintegration
of
the
human
body
into
which
it
has
entered
it
returns
to
the
mineral
kingdom
whence
it
came
and
will
continue
to
traverse
the
kingdoms
of
phenomena
as
before
this
is
an
illustration
designed
to
show
that
the
constituent
elemental
atoms
of
phenomena
undergo
progressive
transference
and
motion
throughout
the
material
kingdoms
in
its
ceaseless
progression
and
journeyings
the
atom
becomes
imbued
with
the
virtues
and
powers
of
each
degree
or
kingdom
it
traverses
in
the
degree
of
the
mineral
it
possessed
mineral
affinities
in
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
it
manifested
the
virtue
augmentative
or
power
of
growth
in
the
animal
organism
it
reflected
the
intelligence
of
that
degree
and
in
the
kingdom
of
man
it
was
qualified
with
human
attributes
or
virtues
furthermore
the
forms
and
organisms
of
phenomenal
being
and
existence
in
each
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
universe
are
myriad
and
numberless
the
vegetable
plane
or
kingdom
for
instance
has
its
infinite
variety
of
types
and
material
structures
of
plant
life
each
distinct
and
different
within
itself
no
two
exactly
alike
in
composition
and
detail
for
there
are
no
repetitions
in
nature
and
the
virtue
augmentative
cannot
be
confined
to
any
given
image
or
shape
each
leaf
has
its
own
particular
identity
so
to
speak
its
own
individuality
as
a
leaf
therefore
each
atom
of
the
innumerable
elemental
atoms
during
its
ceaseless
motion
through
the
kingdoms
of
existence
as
a
constituent
of
organic
composition
not
only
becomes
imbued
with
the
powers
and
virtues
of
the
kingdoms
it
traverses
but
also
reflects
the
attributes
and
qualities
of
the
forms
and
organisms
of
those
kingdoms
as
each
of
these
forms
has
its
individual
and
particular
virtue
therefore
each
elemental
atom
of
the
universe
has
the
opportunity
of
expressing
an
infinite
variety
of
those
individual
virtues
no
atom
is
bereft
or
deprived
of
this
opportunity
or
right
of
expression
nor
can
it
be
said
of
any
given
atom
that
it
is
denied
equal
opportunities
with
other
atoms
nay
all
are
privileged
to
possess
the
virtues
existent
in
these
kingdoms
and
to
reflect
the
attributes
of
their
organisms
in
the
various
transformations
or
passages
from
kingdom
to
kingdom
the
virtues
expressed
by
the
atoms
in
each
degree
are
peculiar
to
that
degree
for
example
in
the
world
of
the
mineral
the
atom
does
not
express
the
vegetable
form
and
organism
and
when
through
the
process
of
transmutation
it
assumes
the
virtues
of
the
vegetable
degree
it
does
not
reflect
the
attributes
of
animal
organisms
and
so
on
it
is
evident
then
that
each
elemental
atom
of
the
universe
is
possessed
of
a
capacity
to
express
all
the
virtues
of
the
universe
this
is
a
subtle
and
abstract
realization
meditate
upon
it
for
within
it
lies
the
true
explanation
of
pantheism
from
this
point
of
view
and
perception
pantheism
is
a
truth
for
every
atom
in
the
universe
possesses
or
reflects
all
the
virtues
of
life
the
manifestation
of
which
is
effected
through
change
and
transformation
therefore
the
origin
and
outcome
of
phenomena
is
verily
the
omnipresent
god
for
the
reality
of
all
phenomenal
existence
is
through
him
there
is
neither
reality
nor
the
manifestation
of
reality
without
the
instrumentality
of
god
existence
is
realized
and
possible
through
the
bounty
of
god
just
as
the
ray
or
flame
emanating
from
this
lamp
is
realized
through
the
bounty
of
the
lamp
from
which
it
originates
even
so
all
phenomena
are
realized
through
the
divine
bounty
and
the
explanation
of
true
pantheistic
statement
and
principle
is
that
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
find
realization
through
the
one
power
animating
and
dominating
all
things
and
all
things
are
but
manifestations
of
its
energy
and
bounty
the
virtue
of
being
and
existence
is
through
no
other
agency
therefore
in
the
words
of
bahaullah
the
first
teaching
is
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
bahaullah
has
announced
that
no
matter
how
far
the
world
of
humanity
may
advance
in
material
civilization
it
is
nevertheless
in
need
of
spiritual
virtues
and
the
bounties
of
god
the
spirit
of
man
is
not
illumined
and
quickened
through
material
sources
it
is
not
resuscitated
by
investigating
phenomena
of
the
world
of
matter
the
spirit
of
man
is
in
need
of
the
protection
of
the
holy
spirit
just
as
he
advances
by
progressive
stages
from
the
mere
physical
world
of
being
into
the
intellectual
realm
so
must
he
develop
upward
in
moral
attributes
and
spiritual
graces
in
the
process
of
this
attainment
he
is
ever
in
need
of
the
bestowals
of
the
holy
spirit
material
development
may
be
likened
to
the
glass
of
a
lamp
whereas
divine
virtues
and
spiritual
susceptibilities
are
the
light
within
the
glass
the
lamp
chimney
is
worthless
without
the
light
likewise
man
in
his
material
condition
requires
the
radiance
and
vivification
of
the
divine
graces
and
merciful
attributes
without
the
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
he
is
lifeless
although
physically
and
mentally
alive
he
is
spiritually
dead
his
holiness
christ
announced
that
which
is
born
of
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
spirit
is
spirit
meaning
that
man
must
be
born
again
as
the
babe
is
born
into
the
light
of
this
physical
world
so
must
the
physical
and
intellectual
man
be
born
into
the
light
of
the
world
of
divinity
in
the
matrix
of
the
mother
the
unborn
child
was
deprived
and
unconscious
of
the
world
of
material
existence
but
after
its
birth
it
beheld
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
a
new
realm
of
life
and
being
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
it
was
utterly
ignorant
and
unable
to
conceive
of
these
new
conditions
but
after
its
transformation
it
discovers
the
radiant
sun
trees
flowers
and
an
infinite
range
of
blessings
and
bounties
awaiting
it
in
the
human
plane
and
kingdom
man
is
a
captive
of
nature
and
ignorant
of
the
divine
world
until
born
of
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
out
of
physical
conditions
of
limitation
and
deprivation
then
he
beholds
the
reality
of
the
spiritual
realm
and
kingdom
realizes
the
narrow
restrictions
of
the
mere
human
world
of
existence
and
becomes
conscious
of
the
unlimited
and
infinite
glories
of
the
world
of
god
therefore
no
matter
how
man
may
advance
upon
the
physical
and
intellectual
plane
he
is
ever
in
need
of
the
boundless
virtues
of
divinity
the
protection
of
the
holy
spirit
and
the
face
of
god
science
the
virtues
of
humanity
are
many
but
science
is
the
most
noble
of
them
all
the
distinction
which
man
enjoys
above
and
beyond
the
station
of
the
animal
is
due
to
this
paramount
virtue
it
is
a
bestowal
of
god
it
is
not
material
it
is
divine
science
is
an
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
the
power
of
investigating
and
discovering
the
verities
of
the
universe
the
means
by
which
man
finds
a
pathway
to
god
all
the
powers
and
attributes
of
man
are
human
and
hereditary
in
origin
outcomes
of
natures
processes
except
the
intellect
which
is
supernatural
through
intellectual
and
intelligent
inquiry
science
is
the
discoverer
of
all
things
it
unites
present
and
past
reveals
the
history
of
bygone
nations
and
events
and
confers
upon
man
today
the
essence
of
all
human
knowledge
and
attainment
throughout
the
ages
by
intellectual
processes
and
logical
deductions
of
reason
this
superpower
in
man
can
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
future
and
anticipate
its
happenings
science
is
the
first
emanation
from
god
toward
man
all
created
beings
embody
the
potentiality
of
material
perfection
but
the
power
of
intellectual
investigation
and
scientific
acquisition
is
a
higher
virtue
specialized
to
man
alone
other
beings
and
organisms
are
deprived
of
this
potentiality
and
attainment
god
has
created
or
deposited
this
love
of
reality
in
man
the
development
and
progress
of
a
nation
is
according
to
the
measure
and
degree
of
that
nations
scientific
attainments
through
this
means
its
greatness
is
continually
increased
and
day
by
day
the
welfare
and
prosperity
of
its
people
are
assured
all
blessings
are
divine
in
origin
but
none
can
be
compared
with
this
power
of
intellectual
investigation
and
research
which
is
an
eternal
gift
producing
fruits
of
unending
delight
man
is
ever
partaking
of
these
fruits
all
other
blessings
are
temporary
this
is
an
everlasting
possession
even
sovereignty
has
its
limitations
and
overthrow
this
is
a
kingship
and
dominion
which
none
may
usurp
or
destroy
briefly
it
is
an
eternal
blessing
and
divine
bestowal
the
supreme
gift
of
god
to
man
therefore
you
should
put
forward
your
most
earnest
efforts
toward
the
acquisition
of
sciences
and
arts
the
greater
your
attainment
the
higher
your
standard
in
the
divine
purpose
the
man
of
science
is
perceiving
and
endowed
with
vision
whereas
he
who
is
ignorant
and
neglectful
of
this
development
is
blind
the
investigating
mind
is
attentive
alive
the
mind
callous
and
indifferent
is
deaf
and
dead
a
scientific
man
is
a
true
index
and
representative
of
humanity
for
through
processes
of
inductive
reasoning
and
research
he
is
informed
of
all
that
appertains
to
humanity
its
status
conditions
and
happenings
he
studies
the
human
body
politic
understands
social
problems
and
weaves
the
web
and
texture
of
civilization
in
fact
science
may
be
likened
to
a
mirror
wherein
the
infinite
forms
and
images
of
existing
things
are
revealed
and
reflected
it
is
the
very
foundation
of
all
individual
and
national
development
without
this
basis
of
investigation
development
is
impossible
therefore
seek
with
diligent
endeavor
the
knowledge
and
attainment
of
all
that
lies
within
the
power
of
this
wonderful
bestowal
we
have
already
stated
that
science
or
the
attribute
of
scientific
penetration
is
supernatural
and
that
all
other
blessings
of
god
are
within
the
boundary
of
nature
what
is
the
proof
of
this
all
created
things
except
man
are
captives
of
nature
the
stars
and
suns
swinging
through
infinite
space
all
earthly
forms
of
life
and
existence
whether
mineral
vegetable
or
animal
come
under
the
dominion
and
control
of
natural
law
man
through
scientific
knowledge
and
power
rules
nature
and
utilizes
her
laws
to
do
his
bidding
according
to
natural
limitations
he
is
a
creature
of
earth
restricted
to
life
upon
its
surface
but
through
scientific
utilization
of
material
laws
he
soars
in
the
sky
sails
upon
the
ocean
and
dives
beneath
it
the
products
of
his
invention
and
discovery
so
familiar
to
us
in
daily
life
were
once
mysteries
of
nature
for
instance
man
has
brought
electricity
out
of
the
plane
of
the
invisible
into
the
plane
of
the
visible
harnessed
and
imprisoned
that
mysterious
natural
agent
and
made
it
the
servant
of
his
needs
and
wishes
similar
instances
are
many
but
we
will
not
prolong
man
as
it
were
takes
the
sword
out
of
natures
hand
and
with
it
for
his
sceptre
of
authority
dominates
nature
itself
nature
is
without
the
crown
of
human
faculties
and
attributes
man
possesses
conscious
intelligence
and
reflection
nature
is
minus
this
is
an
established
fundamental
among
philosophers
man
is
endowed
with
volition
and
memory
nature
has
neither
man
can
seek
out
the
mysteries
latent
in
nature
whereas
nature
is
not
conscious
of
her
own
hidden
phenomena
man
is
progressive
nature
is
stationary
without
the
power
of
progression
or
retrogression
man
is
endowed
with
ideal
virtues
for
example
intellection
volitionamong
them
faith
confession
and
acknowledgment
of
god
while
nature
is
devoid
of
all
these
the
ideal
faculties
of
man
including
the
capacity
of
scientific
acquisition
are
beyond
natures
ken
these
are
powers
whereby
man
is
differentiated
and
distinguished
from
all
other
forms
of
life
this
is
the
bestowal
of
divine
idealism
the
crown
adorning
human
heads
notwithstanding
the
gift
of
this
supernatural
power
it
is
most
amazing
that
materialists
still
consider
themselves
within
the
bounds
and
captivity
of
nature
the
truth
is
that
god
has
endowed
man
with
virtues
powers
and
ideal
faculties
of
which
nature
is
entirely
bereft
and
by
which
man
is
elevated
distinguished
and
superior
we
must
thank
god
for
these
bestowals
for
these
powers
he
has
given
us
for
this
crown
he
has
placed
upon
our
heads
how
shall
we
utilize
these
gifts
and
expend
these
bounties
by
directing
our
efforts
toward
the
unification
of
the
human
race
we
must
use
these
powers
in
establishing
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
appreciate
these
virtues
by
accomplishing
the
unity
of
the
white
and
colored
races
devote
this
divine
intelligence
to
the
perfecting
of
amity
and
accord
among
all
branches
of
the
human
family
so
that
under
the
protection
and
providence
of
god
the
east
and
west
may
hold
each
others
hands
and
become
as
lovers
then
will
mankind
be
as
one
nation
one
race
and
kind
as
waves
of
one
ocean
although
these
waves
may
differ
in
form
and
shape
they
are
waves
of
the
same
sea
flowers
may
be
variegated
in
colors
but
they
are
all
flowers
of
one
garden
trees
differ
though
they
grow
in
the
same
orchard
all
are
nourished
and
quickened
into
life
by
the
bounty
of
the
same
rain
all
grow
and
develop
by
the
heat
and
light
of
the
one
sun
all
are
refreshed
and
exhilarated
by
the
same
breeze
that
they
may
bring
forth
varied
fruits
this
is
according
to
the
creative
wisdom
if
all
trees
bore
the
same
kind
of
fruit
it
would
cease
to
be
delicious
in
their
never
ending
variety
man
finds
enjoyment
instead
of
monotony
and
now
as
i
look
into
your
faces
i
am
reminded
of
trees
varying
in
color
and
form
but
all
bearing
luscious
and
delectable
fruits
fragrant
and
delightful
to
the
inner
and
outer
senses
the
radiance
and
spirituality
of
this
meeting
is
through
the
favor
of
god
our
hearts
are
uplifted
in
thankfulness
to
him
praise
be
to
god
you
are
living
upon
the
great
continent
of
the
west
enjoying
the
perfect
liberty
security
and
peace
of
this
just
government
there
is
no
cause
for
sorrow
or
unhappiness
anywhere
every
means
of
happiness
and
enjoyment
is
about
you
for
in
this
human
world
there
is
no
greater
blessing
than
liberty
you
do
not
know
i
who
for
forty
years
have
been
a
prisoner
do
know
i
do
know
the
value
and
blessing
of
liberty
for
you
have
been
and
are
now
living
in
freedom
and
you
have
no
fear
of
anybody
is
there
a
greater
blessing
than
this
freedom
liberty
security
these
are
the
great
bestowals
of
god
therefore
praise
god
spiritual
springtime
in
the
world
of
existence
man
has
traversed
successive
degrees
until
he
has
attained
the
human
kingdom
in
each
degree
of
his
progression
he
has
developed
capacity
for
advancement
to
the
next
station
and
condition
while
in
the
kingdom
of
the
mineral
he
was
attaining
the
capacity
for
promotion
into
the
degree
of
the
vegetable
in
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
he
underwent
preparation
for
the
world
of
the
animal
and
from
thence
he
has
come
onward
to
the
human
degree
or
kingdom
throughout
this
journey
of
progression
he
has
ever
and
always
been
potentially
man
in
the
beginning
of
his
human
life
man
was
embryonic
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
there
he
received
capacity
and
endowment
for
the
reality
of
human
existence
the
forces
and
powers
necessary
for
this
world
were
bestowed
upon
him
in
that
limited
condition
in
this
world
he
needed
eyes
he
received
them
potentially
in
the
other
he
needed
ears
he
obtained
them
there
in
readiness
and
preparation
for
his
new
existence
the
powers
requisite
in
this
world
were
conferred
upon
him
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
so
that
when
he
entered
this
realm
of
real
existence
he
not
only
possessed
all
necessary
functions
and
powers
but
found
provision
for
his
material
sustenance
awaiting
him
therefore
in
this
world
he
must
prepare
himself
for
the
life
beyond
that
which
he
needs
in
the
world
of
the
kingdom
must
be
obtained
here
just
as
he
prepared
himself
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
by
acquiring
forces
necessary
in
this
sphere
of
existence
so
likewise
the
indispensable
forces
of
the
divine
existence
must
be
potentially
attained
in
this
world
what
is
he
in
need
of
in
the
kingdom
which
transcends
the
life
and
limitation
of
this
mortal
sphere
that
world
beyond
is
a
world
of
sanctity
and
radiance
therefore
it
is
necessary
that
in
this
world
he
should
acquire
these
divine
attributes
in
that
world
there
is
need
of
spirituality
faith
assurance
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
these
he
must
attain
in
this
world
so
that
after
his
ascension
from
the
earthly
to
the
heavenly
kingdom
he
shall
find
all
that
is
needful
in
that
life
eternal
ready
for
him
that
divine
world
is
manifestly
a
world
of
lights
therefore
man
has
need
of
illumination
here
that
is
a
world
of
love
the
love
of
god
is
essential
it
is
a
world
of
perfections
virtues
or
perfections
must
be
acquired
that
world
is
vivified
by
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
in
this
world
we
must
seek
them
that
is
the
kingdom
of
life
everlasting
it
must
be
attained
during
this
vanishing
existence
by
what
means
can
man
acquire
these
things
how
shall
he
obtain
these
merciful
gifts
and
powers
first
through
the
knowledge
of
god
second
through
the
love
of
god
third
through
faith
fourth
through
philanthropic
deeds
fifth
through
selfsacrifice
sixth
through
severance
from
this
world
seventh
through
sanctity
and
holiness
unless
he
acquires
these
forces
and
attains
to
these
requirements
he
will
surely
be
deprived
of
the
life
that
is
eternal
but
if
he
possesses
the
knowledge
of
god
becomes
ignited
through
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
witnesses
the
great
and
mighty
signs
of
the
kingdom
becomes
the
cause
of
love
among
mankind
and
lives
in
the
utmost
state
of
sanctity
and
holiness
he
shall
surely
attain
to
second
birth
be
baptized
by
the
holy
spirit
and
enjoy
everlasting
existence
is
it
not
astonishing
that
although
man
has
been
created
for
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
for
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
for
spirituality
heavenly
illumination
and
life
eternal
nevertheless
he
continues
ignorant
and
negligent
of
all
this
consider
how
he
seeks
knowledge
of
everything
except
knowledge
of
god
for
instance
his
utmost
desire
is
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
lowest
strata
of
the
earth
day
by
day
he
strives
to
know
what
can
be
found
ten
metres
below
the
surface
what
he
can
discover
within
the
stone
what
he
can
learn
by
archaeological
research
in
the
dust
he
puts
forth
arduous
labors
to
fathom
terrestrial
mysteries
but
is
not
at
all
concerned
about
knowing
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
traversing
the
illimitable
fields
of
the
eternal
world
becoming
informed
of
the
divine
realities
discovering
the
secrets
of
god
attaining
the
knowledge
of
god
witnessing
the
splendors
of
the
sun
of
truth
and
realizing
the
glories
of
everlasting
life
he
is
unmindful
and
thoughtless
of
these
how
much
he
is
attracted
to
the
mysteries
of
matter
and
how
completely
unaware
he
is
of
the
mysteries
of
divinity
nay
he
is
utterly
negligent
and
oblivious
of
the
secrets
of
divinity
how
great
his
ignorance
how
conducive
to
his
degradation
it
is
as
if
a
kind
and
loving
father
had
provided
a
library
of
wonderful
books
for
his
son
in
order
that
he
might
be
informed
of
the
mysteries
of
creation
at
the
same
time
surrounding
him
with
every
means
of
comfort
and
enjoyment
but
the
son
amuses
himself
with
pebbles
and
playthings
neglectful
of
all
his
fathers
gifts
and
provision
how
ignorant
and
heedless
is
man
the
father
has
willed
for
him
glory
eternal
and
he
is
content
with
blindness
and
deprivation
the
father
has
built
for
him
a
royal
palace
but
he
is
playing
with
the
dust
prepared
for
him
garments
of
silk
but
he
prefers
to
remain
unclothed
provided
for
him
delicious
foods
and
fruits
while
he
seeks
sustenance
in
the
grasses
of
the
field
praise
be
to
god
you
have
heard
the
call
of
the
kingdom
your
eyes
are
opened
you
have
turned
to
god
your
purpose
is
the
goodpleasure
of
god
the
understanding
of
the
mysteries
of
the
heart
and
investigation
of
the
realities
day
and
night
you
must
strive
that
you
may
attain
to
the
significances
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
perceive
the
signs
of
divinity
acquire
certainty
of
knowledge
and
realize
that
this
world
has
a
creator
a
vivifier
a
provider
an
architectknowing
this
through
proofs
and
evidences
and
not
through
susceptibilitiesnay
rather
through
decisive
arguments
and
real
vision
that
is
to
say
visualizing
it
as
clearly
as
the
outer
eye
beholds
the
sun
in
this
way
may
you
behold
the
presence
of
god
and
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
the
holy
divine
manifestations
eternal
unity
what
is
real
unity
when
we
observe
the
human
world
we
find
various
collective
expressions
of
unity
therein
for
instance
man
is
distinguished
from
the
animal
by
his
degree
or
kingdom
this
comprehensive
distinction
includes
all
the
posterity
of
adam
and
constitutes
one
great
household
or
human
family
which
may
be
considered
the
fundamental
or
physical
unity
of
mankind
furthermore
a
distinction
exists
between
various
groups
of
humankind
according
to
lineage
each
group
forming
a
racial
unity
separate
from
the
others
there
is
also
the
unity
of
tongue
among
those
who
use
the
same
language
as
a
means
of
communication
national
unity
where
various
peoples
live
under
one
form
of
government
such
as
french
german
british
etc
and
political
unity
which
conserves
the
civil
rights
of
parties
or
factions
of
the
same
government
all
these
unities
are
imaginary
and
without
real
foundation
for
no
real
result
proceeds
from
them
the
purpose
of
true
unity
is
real
and
divine
outcomes
from
these
limited
unities
mentioned
only
limited
outcomes
proceed
whereas
unlimited
unity
produces
unlimited
result
for
instance
from
the
limited
unity
of
race
or
nationality
the
results
at
most
are
limited
it
is
like
a
family
living
alone
and
solitary
there
are
no
unlimited
or
universal
outcomes
from
it
the
unity
which
is
productive
of
unlimited
results
is
first
a
unity
of
mankind
which
recognizes
that
all
are
sheltered
beneath
the
overshadowing
glory
of
the
allglorious
that
all
are
servants
of
one
god
for
all
breathe
the
same
atmosphere
live
upon
the
same
earth
move
beneath
the
same
heavens
receive
effulgence
from
the
same
sun
and
are
under
the
protection
of
one
god
this
is
the
most
great
unity
and
its
results
are
lasting
if
humanity
adheres
to
it
but
mankind
has
hitherto
violated
it
adhering
to
sectarian
or
other
limited
unities
such
as
racial
patriotic
or
unity
of
selfinterests
therefore
no
great
results
have
been
forthcoming
nevertheless
it
is
certain
that
the
radiance
and
favors
of
god
are
encompassing
minds
have
developed
perceptions
have
become
acute
sciences
and
arts
are
widespread
and
capacity
exists
for
the
proclamation
and
promulgation
of
the
real
and
ultimate
unity
of
mankind
which
will
bring
forth
marvelous
results
it
will
reconcile
all
religions
make
warring
nations
loving
cause
hostile
kings
to
become
friendly
and
bring
peace
and
happiness
to
the
human
world
it
will
cement
together
the
orient
and
occident
remove
forever
the
foundations
of
war
and
upraise
the
ensign
of
the
most
great
peace
these
limited
unities
are
therefore
signs
of
that
great
unity
which
will
make
all
the
human
family
one
by
being
productive
of
the
attractions
of
conscience
in
mankind
another
unity
is
the
spiritual
unity
which
emanates
from
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
this
is
greater
than
the
unity
of
mankind
human
unity
or
solidarity
may
be
likened
to
the
body
whereas
unity
from
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
is
the
spirit
animating
the
body
this
is
a
perfect
unity
it
creates
such
a
condition
in
mankind
that
each
one
will
make
sacrifices
for
the
other
and
the
utmost
desire
will
be
to
forfeit
life
and
all
that
pertains
to
it
in
behalf
of
anothers
good
this
is
the
unity
which
existed
among
the
disciples
of
his
holiness
jesus
christ
and
bound
together
the
prophets
and
holy
souls
of
the
past
it
is
the
unity
which
through
the
influence
of
the
divine
spirit
is
permeating
the
bahais
so
that
each
offers
his
life
for
the
other
and
strives
with
all
sincerity
to
attain
his
goodpleasure
this
is
the
unity
which
caused
twenty
thousand
people
in
persia
to
give
their
lives
in
love
and
devotion
to
it
it
made
the
bab
the
target
of
a
thousand
arrows
and
caused
bahaullah
to
suffer
exile
and
imprisonment
forty
years
this
unity
is
the
very
spirit
of
the
body
of
the
world
it
is
impossible
for
the
body
of
the
world
to
become
quickened
with
life
without
its
vivification
his
holiness
jesus
christmay
my
life
be
a
sacrifice
to
himpromulgated
this
unity
among
mankind
every
soul
who
believed
in
jesus
christ
became
revivified
and
resuscitated
through
this
spirit
attained
to
the
zenith
of
eternal
glory
realized
the
life
everlasting
experienced
the
second
birth
and
rose
to
the
acme
of
good
fortune
in
the
word
of
god
there
is
still
another
unity
the
oneness
of
the
manifestations
of
god
his
holiness
abraham
moses
jesus
christ
mohammed
the
bab
and
bahaullah
this
is
a
unity
divine
heavenly
radiant
merciful
the
one
reality
appearing
in
its
successive
manifestations
for
instance
the
sun
is
one
and
the
same
but
its
points
of
dawning
are
various
during
the
summer
season
it
rises
from
the
northern
point
of
the
ecliptic
in
winter
it
appears
from
the
southern
point
of
rising
each
month
between
it
appears
from
a
certain
zodiacal
position
although
these
dawningpoints
are
different
the
sun
is
the
same
sun
which
has
appeared
from
them
all
the
significance
is
the
reality
of
prophethood
which
is
symbolized
by
the
sun
and
the
holy
manifestations
are
the
dawningplaces
or
zodiacal
points
there
is
also
the
divine
unity
or
entity
which
is
sanctified
above
all
concept
of
humanity
it
cannot
be
comprehended
nor
conceived
because
it
is
infinite
reality
and
cannot
become
finite
human
minds
are
incapable
of
surrounding
that
reality
because
all
thoughts
and
conceptions
of
it
are
finite
intellectual
creations
and
not
the
reality
of
divine
being
which
alone
knows
itself
for
example
if
we
form
a
conception
of
divinity
as
a
living
almighty
selfsubsisting
eternal
being
this
is
only
a
concept
apprehended
by
a
human
intellectual
reality
it
would
not
be
the
outward
visible
reality
which
is
beyond
the
power
of
human
mind
to
conceive
or
encompass
we
ourselves
have
an
external
visible
entity
but
even
our
concept
of
it
is
the
product
of
our
own
brain
and
limited
comprehension
the
reality
of
divinity
is
sanctified
above
this
degree
of
knowing
and
realization
it
has
ever
been
hidden
and
secluded
in
its
own
holiness
and
sanctity
above
our
comprehending
although
it
transcends
our
realization
its
lights
bestowals
traces
and
virtues
have
become
manifest
in
the
realities
of
the
prophets
even
as
the
sun
becomes
resplendent
in
various
mirrors
these
holy
realities
are
as
reflectors
and
the
reality
of
divinity
is
as
the
sun
which
although
it
is
reflected
from
the
mirrors
and
its
virtues
and
perfections
become
resplendent
therein
does
not
stoop
from
its
own
station
of
majesty
and
glory
and
seek
abode
in
the
mirrors
it
remains
in
its
heaven
of
sanctity
at
most
it
is
this
that
its
lights
become
manifest
and
evident
in
its
mirrors
or
manifestations
therefore
its
bounty
proceeding
from
them
is
one
bounty
but
the
recipients
of
that
bounty
are
many
this
is
the
unity

this

this
is

whereby
we
praise
and
adore
god
the
darkened
lights
from
the
time
of
the
creation
of
adam
to
this
day
there
have
been
two
pathways
in
the
world
of
humanity
one
the
natural
or
materialistic
the
other
the
religious
or
spiritual
the
pathway
of
nature
is
the
pathway
of
the
animal
realm
the
animal
acts
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
nature
follows
its
own
instincts
and
desires
whatever
its
impulses
and
proclivities
may
be
it
has
the
liberty
to
gratify
them
yet
it
is
a
captive
of
nature
it
cannot
deviate
in
the
least
degree
from
the
road
nature
has
established
it
is
utterly
minus
spiritual
susceptibilities
ignorant
of
divine
religion
and
without
knowledge
of
the
kingdom
of
god
the
animal
possesses
no
power
of
ideation
or
conscious
intelligence
it
is
a
captive
of
the
senses
and
deprived
of
that
which
lies
beyond
them
it
is
subject
to
what
the
eye
sees
the
ear
hears
the
nostrils
sense
the
taste
detects
and
touch
reveals
these
sensations
are
acceptable
and
sufficient
for
the
animal
but
that
which
is
beyond
the
range
of
the
senses
that
realm
of
phenomena
through
which
the
conscious
pathway
to
the
kingdom
of
god
leads
the
world
of
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
divine
religionof
these
the
animal
is
completely
unaware
for
in
its
highest
station
it
is
a
captive
of
nature
one
of
the
strangest
things
witnessed
is
that
the
materialists
of
today
are
proud
of
their
natural
instincts
and
bondage
they
state
that
nothing
is
entitled
to
belief
and
acceptance
except
that
which
is
sensible
or
tangible
by
their
own
statements
they
are
captives
of
nature
unconscious
of
the
spiritual
world
uninformed
of
the
divine
kingdom
and
unaware
of
heavenly
bestowals
if
this
be
a
virtue
the
animal
has
attained
it
to
a
superlative
degree
for
the
animal
is
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
realm
of
spirit
and
out
of
touch
with
the
inner
world
of
conscious
realization
the
animal
would
agree
with
the
materialist
in
denying
the
existence
of
that
which
transcends
the
senses
if
we
admit
that
being
limited
to
the
plane
of
the
senses
is
a
virtue
the
animal
is
indeed
more
virtuous
than
man
for
it
is
entirely
bereft
of
that
which
lies
beyond
absolutely
oblivious
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
its
traces
whereas
god
has
deposited
within
the
human
creature
an
illimitable
power
by
which
he
can
rule
the
world
of
nature
consider
how
all
other
phenomenal
existence
and
beings
are
captives
of
nature
the
sun
that
colossal
center
of
our
solar
system
the
giant
stars
and
planets
the
towering
mountains
the
earth
itself
and
its
kingdoms
of
life
lower
than
the
humanall
are
captives
of
nature
except
man
no
other
created
thing
can
deviate
in
the
slightest
degree
from
obedience
to
natural
law
the
sun
in
its
glory
and
greatness
millions
of
miles
away
is
held
prisoner
in
its
orbit
of
universal
revolution
captive
of
universal
natural
control
man
is
the
ruler
of
nature
according
to
natural
law
and
limitation
he
should
remain
upon
the
earth
but
behold
how
he
violates
this
command
and
soars
above
the
mountains
in
aeroplanes
he
sails
in
ships
upon
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
dives
into
its
depths
in
submarines
man
makes
nature
his
servant
harnesses
the
mighty
energy
of
electricity
for
instance
and
imprisons
it
in
a
small
lamp
for
his
uses
and
conveniences
he
speaks
from
the
east
to
the
west
through
a
wire
he
is
able
to
store
and
preserve
his
voice
in
a
phonograph
though
he
is
a
dweller
upon
earth
he
penetrates
the
mysteries
of
starry
worlds
inconceivably
distant
he
discovers
latent
realities
within
the
bosom
of
the
earth
uncovers
treasures
penetrates
secrets
and
mysteries
of
the
phenomenal
world
and
brings
to
light
that
which
according
to
natures
jealous
laws
should
remain
hidden
unknown
and
unfathomable
through
an
ideal
inner
power
man
brings
these
realities
forth
from
the
invisible
plane
to
the
visible
this
is
contrary
to
natures
law
it
is
evident
therefore
that
man
is
ruler
over
natures
sphere
and
province
nature
is
inert
man
is
progressive
nature
has
no
consciousness
man
is
endowed
with
it
nature
is
without
volition
and
acts
perforce
whereas
man
possesses
a
mighty
will
nature
is
incapable
of
discovering
mysteries
or
realities
whereas
man
is
especially
fitted
to
do
so
nature
is
not
in
touch
with
the
realm
of
god
man
is
attuned
to
its
evidences
nature
is
uninformed
of
god
man
is
conscious
of
him
man
acquires
divine
virtues
nature
is
denied
them
man
can
voluntarily
discontinue
vices
nature
has
no
power
to
modify
the
influence
of
its
instincts
altogether
it
is
evident
that
man
is
more
noble
and
superior
that
in
him
there
is
an
ideal
power
surpassing
nature
he
has
consciousness
volition
memory
intelligent
power
divine
attributes
and
virtues
of
which
nature
is
completely
deprived
bereft
and
minus
therefore
man
is
higher
and
nobler
by
reason
of
the
ideal
and
heavenly
force
latent
and
manifest
in
him
how
strange
then
it
seems
that
man
notwithstanding
his
endowment
with
this
ideal
power
will
descend
to
a
level
beneath
him
and
declare
himself
no
greater
than
that
which
is
manifestly
inferior
to
his
real
station
god
has
created
such
a
conscious
spirit
within
him
that
he
is
the
most
wonderful
of
all
contingent
beings
in
ignoring
these
virtues
he
descends
to
the
material
plane
considers
matter
the
ruler
of
existence
and
denies
that
which
lies
beyond
is
this
virtue
in
its
fullest
sense
this
is
animalistic
for
the
animal
realizes
nothing
more
in
fact
from
this
standpoint
the
animal
is
the
greater
philosopher
because
it
is
completely
ignorant
of
the
kingdom
of
god
possesses
no
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
is
uninformed
of
the
heavenly
world
in
brief
this
is
a
view
of
the
pathway
of
nature
the
second
pathway
is
that
of
religion
the
road
of
the
divine
kingdom
it
involves
the
acquisition
of
praiseworthy
attributes
heavenly
illumination
and
righteous
actions
in
the
world
of
humanity
this
pathway
is
conducive
to
the
progress
and
uplift
of
the
world
it
is
the
source
of
human
enlightenment
training
and
ethical
improvement
the
magnet
which
attracts
the
love
of
god
because
of
the
knowledge
of
god
it
bestows
this
is
the
road
of
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
for
they
are
in
reality
the
foundation
of
the
divine
religion
of
oneness
there
is
no
change
or
transformation
in
this
pathway
it
is
the
cause
of
human
betterment
the
acquisition
of
heavenly
virtues
and
the
illumination
of
mankind
alas
that
humanity
is
completely
submerged
in
imitations
and
unrealities
notwithstanding
the
truth
of
divine
religion
has
ever
remained
the
same
superstitions
have
obscured
the
fundamental
reality
the
world
is
darkened
and
the
light
of
religion
is
not
apparent
this
darkness
is
conducive
to
differences
and
dissensions
rites
and
dogmas
are
many
and
various
therefore
discord
has
arisen
among
the
religious
systems
whereas
religion
is
for
the
unification
of
mankind
true
religion
is
the
source
of
love
and
agreement
amongst
men
the
cause
of
the
development
of
praiseworthy
qualities
but
the
people
are
holding
to
the
counterfeit
and
imitation
negligent
of
the
reality
which
unifies
so
they
are
bereft
and
deprived
of
the
radiance
of
religion
they
follow
superstitions
inherited
from
their
fathers
and
ancestors
to
such
an
extent
has
this
prevailed
that
they
have
taken
away
the
heavenly
light
of
divine
truth
and
sit
in
the
darkness
of
imitations
and
imaginations
that
which
was
meant
to
be
conducive
to
life
has
become
the
cause
of
death
that
which
should
have
been
an
evidence
of
knowledge
is
now
a
proof
of
ignorance
that
which
was
a
factor
in
the
sublimity
of
human
nature
has
proved
to
be
its
degradation
therefore
the
realm
of
the
religionist
has
gradually
narrowed
and
darkened
and
the
sphere
of
the
materialist
has
widened
and
advanced
for
the
religionist
has
held
to
imitation
and
counterfeit
neglecting
and
discarding
holiness
and
the
sacred
reality
of
religion
when
the
sun
sets
it
is
the
time
for
bats
to
fly
they
come
forth
because
they
are
creatures
of
the
night
when
the
lights
of
religion
become
darkened
the
materialists
appear
they
are
the
bats
of
night
the
decline
of
religion
is
their
time
of
activity
they
seek
the
shadows
when
the
world
is
darkened
and
clouds
have
spread
over
it
the
need
of
divine
education
in
the
books
of
the
prophets
certain
gladtidings
are
recorded
which
are
absolutely
true
and
free
from
doubt
the
east
has
ever
been
the
dawningpoint
of
the
sun
of
reality
all
the
prophets
of
god
have
appeared
there
the
religions
of
god
have
been
promulgated
the
teachings
of
god
have
been
spread
and
the
law
of
god
founded
in
the
east
the
orient
has
always
been
the
center
of
lights
the
west
has
acquired
illumination
from
the
east
but
in
some
respects
the
reflection
of
the
light
has
been
greater
in
the
occident
this
is
especially
true
of
christianity
his
holiness
christ
appeared
in
palestine
and
his
teachings
were
founded
there
although
the
doors
of
the
kingdom
were
opened
in
that
country
and
the
bestowals
of
divinity
were
spread
broadcast
from
its
center
the
people
of
the
west
have
embraced
and
promulgated
christianity
more
fully
than
those
in
the
east
the
sun
of
reality
shone
forth
from
the
horizon
of
the
east
but
its
heat
and
ray
are
most
resplendent
in
the
west
where
the
radiant
standard
of
his
holiness
christ
has
been
upraised
i
have
great
hopes
that
the
lights
of
bahaullahs
appearance
may
also
find
the
fullest
manifestation
and
reflection
in
these
western
regions
for
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
are
especially
applicable
to
the
conditions
of
the
people
here
the
western
nations
are
endowed
with
the
capability
of
understanding
the
rational
and
peerless
words
of
bahaullah
and
realizing
that
the
essence
of
the
teachings
of
all
the
former
prophets
can
be
found
in
his
utterance
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
christ
have
been
promulgated
by
his
holiness
bahaullah
who
has
also
revealed
new
teachings
applicable
to
present
conditions
in
the
world
of
humanity
he
has
trained
the
people
of
the
east
through
the
power
and
protection
of
the
holy
spirit
cemented
the
souls
of
humanity
together
and
established
the
foundations
of
international
unity
through
the
power
of
his
words
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
all
religions
have
been
attuned
in
harmony
for
instance
among
the
bahais
in
persia
there
are
christians
mohammedans
zoroastrians
jews
and
many
others
of
varying
denominations
and
beliefs
who
have
been
brought
together
in
unity
and
love
in
the
cause
of
bahaullah
although
these
people
were
formerly
hostile
and
antagonistic
filled
with
hatred
and
bitterness
toward
each
other
bloodthirsty
and
pillaging
considering
that
animosity
and
attack
were
the
means
of
attaining
the
goodpleasure
of
god
they
have
now
become
loving
and
filled
with
the
radiant
zeal
of
fellowship
and
brotherhood
the
purpose
of
them
all
being
service
to
the
world
of
humanity
promotion
of
international
peace
the
unification
of
the
divine
religions
and
deeds
of
universal
philanthropy
by
their
words
and
actions
they
are
proving
the
verity
of
his
holiness
bahaullah
consider
the
animosity
and
hatred
existing
today
between
the
various
nations
of
the
world
what
disagreements
and
hostilities
arise
what
warfare
and
contention
how
much
bloodshed
what
injustice
and
tyranny
just
now
there
is
war
in
eastern
turkey
also
war
between
turkey
and
italy
nations
are
devoted
to
conquest
and
bloodshed
filled
with
the
animus
of
religious
hatred
seeking
the
goodpleasure
of
god
by
killing
and
destroying
those
whom
they
consider
enemies
in
their
blindness
how
ignorant
they
are
that
which
is
forbidden
by
god
they
consider
acceptable
to
him
god
is
love
god
seeketh
fellowship
purity
sanctity
and
longsuffering
these
are
the
attributes
of
divinity
therefore
these
warring
raging
nations
have
arisen
against
divinity
imagining
they
are
serving
god
what
gross
ignorance
this
is
what
injustice
blindness
and
lack
of
realization
briefly
we
must
strive
with
heart
and
soul
in
order
that
this
darkness
of
the
contingent
world
may
be
dispelled
that
the
lights
of
the
kingdom
shall
shine
upon
all
the
horizons
the
world
of
humanity
become
illumined
the
image
of
god
become
apparent
in
human
mirrors
the
law
of
god
be
well
established
and
that
all
regions
of
the
world
shall
enjoy
peace
comfort
and
composure
beneath
the
equitable
protection
of
god
my
admonition
and
exhortation
to
you
is
this
be
kind
to
all
people
love
humanity
consider
all
mankind
as
your
relations
and
servants
of
the
most
high
god
strive
day
and
night
that
animosity
and
contention
may
pass
away
from
the
hearts
of
men
that
all
religions
shall
become
reconciled
and
the
nations
love
each
other
so
that
no
racial
religious
or
political
prejudice
may
remain
and
the
world
of
humanity
behold
god
as
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
existence
god
has
created
all
and
all
return
to
god
therefore
love
humanity
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
if
you
meet
a
poor
man
assist
him
if
you
see
the
sick
heal
him
reassure
the
affrighted
one
render
the
cowardly
noble
and
courageous
educate
the
ignorant
associate
with
the
stranger
emulate
god
consider
how
kindly
how
lovingly
he
deals
with
all
and
follow
his
example
you
must
treat
people
in
accordance
with
the
divine
precepts
in
other
words
treat
them
as
kindly
as
god
treats
them
for
this
is
the
greatest
attainment
possible
for
the
world
of
humanity
furthermore
know
ye
that
god
has
created
in
man
the
power
of
reason
whereby
man
is
enabled
to
investigate
reality
god
has
not
intended
man
to
blindly
imitate
his
fathers
and
ancestors
he
has
endowed
him
with
mind
or
the
faculty
of
reasoning
by
the
exercise
of
which
he
is
to
investigate
and
discover
the
truth
and
that
which
he
finds
real
and
true
he
must
accept
he
must
not
be
an
imitator
or
blind
follower
of
any
soul
he
must
not
rely
implicitly
upon
the
opinion
of
any
man
without
investigation
nay
each
soul
must
seek
intelligently
and
independently
arriving
at
a
real
conclusion
and
bound
only
by
that
reality
the
greatest
cause
of
bereavement
and
disheartening
in
the
world
of
humanity
is
ignorance
based
upon
blind
imitation
it
is
due
to
this
that
wars
and
battles
prevail
from
this
cause
hatred
and
animosity
arise
continually
among
mankind
through
failure
to
investigate
reality
the
jews
rejected
his
holiness
jesus
christ
they
were
expecting
his
coming
by
day
and
night
they
mourned
and
lamented
saying
o
god
hasten
thou
the
day
of
the
advent
of
christ
expressing
most
intense
longing
for
the
messiah
but
when
his
holiness
christ
appeared
they
denied
and
rejected
him
treated
him
with
arrogant
contempt
sentenced
him
to
death
and
finally
crucified
him
why
did
this
happen
because
they
were
blindly
following
imitations
believing
that
which
had
descended
to
them
as
a
heritage
from
their
fathers
and
ancestors
tenaciously
holding
to
it
and
refusing
to
investigate
the
reality
of
christ
therefore
they
were
deprived
of
the
bounties
of
his
holiness
whereas
if
they
had
forsaken
imitations
and
investigated
the
reality
of
the
messiah
they
would
have
surely
been
guided
to
believing
in
him
instead
of
this
they
said
we
have
heard
from
our
fathers
and
have
read
in
the
old
testament
that
his
holiness
christ
must
come
from
an
unknown
place
now
we
find
that
this
one
has
come
from
nazareth
steeped
in
the
literal
interpretation
and
imitating
the
beliefs
of
fathers
and
ancestors
they
failed
to
understand
the
fact
that
although
the
body
of
jesus
came
from
nazareth
the
reality
of
the
christ
came
from
the
unknown
place
of
the
divine
kingdom
they
also
said
that
the
sceptre
of
his
holiness
christ
would
be
of
iron
that
is
to
say
he
should
wield
a
sword
when
his
holiness
christ
appeared
he
did
possess
a
sword
but
it
was
the
sword
of
his
tongue
with
which
he
separated
the
false
from
the
true
but
the
jews
were
blind
to
the
spiritual
significance
and
symbolism
of
the
prophetic
words
they
also
expected
that
the
messiah
would
sit
upon
the
throne
of
david
whereas
his
holiness
the
christ
had
neither
throne
nor
semblance
of
sovereignty
nay
rather
he
was
a
poor
man
apparently
abject
and
vanquished
therefore
how
could
he
be
the
veritable
christ
this
was
one
of
their
most
insistent
objections
based
upon
ancestral
interpretation
and
teaching
in
reality
his
holiness
christ
was
glorified
with
an
eternal
sovereignty
and
everlasting
dominion
spiritual
and
not
temporal
his
throne
and
kingdom
were
established
in
human
hearts
where
he
reigns
with
power
and
authority
without
end
notwithstanding
the
fulfillment
of
all
the
prophetic
signs
in
his
holiness
the
jews
denied
him
and
entered
the
period
of
their
deprivation
because
of
their
allegiance
to
imitations
and
ancestral
forms
among
other
objections
they
said
we
are
promised
through
the
tongue
of
the
prophets
that
his
holiness
christ
at
the
time
of
his
coming
would
proclaim
the
law
of
the
torah
whereas
now
we
see
this
person
abrogating
the
commands
of
the
pentateuch
disturbing
our
blessed
sabbath
and
abolishing
the
law
of
divorce
he
has
left
nothing
of
the
ancient
law
of
moses
therefore
he
is
the
enemy
of
moses
in
reality
his
holiness
christ
proclaimed
and
completed
the
law
of
moses
he
was
the
very
helper
and
assister
of
moses
he
spread
the
book
of
moses
throughout
the
world
and
established
anew
the
fundamentals
of
the
law
revealed
by
him
he
abolished
certain
unimportant
laws
and
forms
which
were
no
longer
compatible
with
the
exigencies
of
the
time
such
as
divorce
and
plurality
of
wives
the
jews
did
not
comprehend
this
and
the
cause
of
their
ignorance
was
blind
and
tenacious
adherence
to
imitations
of
ancient
forms
and
teachings
therefore
they
finally
sentenced
his
holiness
to
death
they
likewise
said
through
the
tongues
of
the
prophets
it
was
announced
that
during
the
time
of
christs
appearance
the
justice
of
god
would
prevail
throughout
the
world
tyranny
and
oppression
would
be
unknown
justice
would
even
extend
to
the
animal
kingdom
ferocious
beasts
would
associate
in
gentleness
and
peace
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
would
drink
from
the
same
spring
the
lion
and
the
deer
meet
in
the
same
meadow
the
eagle
and
quail
dwell
together
in
the
same
nest
but
instead
of
this
we
see
that
during
the
time
of
this
supposed
christ
the
romans
have
conquered
palestine
and
are
ruling
it
with
extreme
tyranny
justice
is
nowhere
apparent
and
signs
of
peace
in
the
kingdom
are
conspicuously
absent
these
statements
and
attitudes
of
the
jews
were
inherited
from
their
fathers
blind
allegiance
to
literal
expectations
which
did
not
come
to
pass
during
the
time
of
jesus
christ
the
real
purport
of
these
prophetic
statements
was
that
various
peoples
symbolized
by
the
wolf
and
lamb
between
whom
love
and
fellowship
were
impossible
would
come
together
during
messiahs
reign
drink
from
the
same
fountain
of
life
in
his
teachings
and
become
his
devoted
followers
this
was
realized
when
peoples
of
all
religions
nationalities
and
dispositions
became
united
in
their
beliefs
and
followed
christ
in
humility
associating
in
love
and
brotherhood
under
the
shadow
of
his
divine
protection
the
jews
being
blind
to
this
and
holding
to
their
bigoted
imitations
were
insolent
and
arrogant
toward
his
holiness
and
crucified
him
had
they
investigated
the
reality
of
christ
they
would
have
beheld
his
beauty
and
truth
god
has
given
man
the
eye
of
investigation
by
which
he
may
see
and
recognize
truth
he
has
endowed
man
with
ears
that
he
may
hear
the
message
of
reality
and
conferred
upon
him
the
gift
of
reason
by
which
he
may
discover
things
for
himself
this
is
his
endowment
and
equipment
for
the
investigation
of
reality
man
is
not
intended
to
see
through
the
eyes
of
another
hear
through
anothers
ears
nor
comprehend
with
anothers
brain
each
human
creature
has
individual
endowment
power
and
responsibility
in
the
creative
plan
of
god
therefore
depend
upon
your
own
reason
and
judgment
and
adhere
to
the
outcome
of
your
own
investigation
otherwise
you
will
be
utterly
submerged
in
the
sea
of
ignorance
and
deprived
of
all
the
bounties
of
god
turn
to
god
supplicate
humbly
at
his
threshold
seeking
assistance
and
confirmation
that
god
may
rend
asunder
the
veils
that
obscure
your
vision
then
will
your
eyes
be
filled
with
illumination
face
to
face
you
will
behold
the
reality
of
god
and
your
heart
become
completely
purified
from
the
dross
of
ignorance
reflecting
the
glories
and
bounties
of
the
kingdom
holy
souls
are
like
soil
which
has
been
plowed
and
tilled
with
much
earnest
labor
the
thorns
and
thistles
cast
aside
and
all
weeds
uprooted
such
soil
is
most
fruitful
and
the
harvest
from
it
will
prove
full
and
plenteous
in
this
same
way
man
must
free
himself
from
the
weeds
of
ignorance
thorns
of
superstitions
and
thistles
of
imitations
that
he
may
discover
reality
in
the
harvests
of
true
knowledge
otherwise
the
discovery
of
reality
is
impossible
contention
and
divergence
of
religious
belief
will
always
remain
and
mankind
like
ferocious
wolves
will
rage
and
attack
each
other
in
hatred
and
antagonism
we
supplicate
god
that
he
may
destroy
the
veils
which
limit
our
vision
and
that
these
becloudings
which
darken
the
way
of
the
manifestation
of
the
shining
lights
may
be
dispelled
in
order
that
the
effulgent
sun
of
reality
may
shine
forth
we
implore
and
invoke
god
seeking
his
assistance
and
confirmation
man
is
a
child
of
god
most
noble
lofty
and
beloved
by
god
his
creator
therefore
he
must
ever
strive
that
the
divine
bounties
and
virtues
bestowed
upon
him
may
prevail
and
control
him
just
now
the
soil
of
human
hearts
seems
like
black
earth
but
in
the
innermost
substance
of
this
dark
soil
there
are
thousands
of
fragrant
flowers
latent
we
must
endeavor
to
cultivate
and
awaken
these
potentialities
discover
the
secret
treasure
in
this
very
mine
and
depository
of
god
bring
forth
these
resplendent
powers
long
hidden
in
human
hearts
then
will
the
glories
of
both
worlds
be
blended
and
increased
and
the
quintessence
of
human
existence
be
made
manifest
we
must
not
be
content
with
simply
following
a
certain
course
because
we
find
our
fathers
pursued
that
course
it
is
the
duty
of
everyone
to
investigate
reality
and
investigation
of
reality
by
another
will
not
do
for
us
if
all
in
the
world
were
rich
and
one
man
poor
of
what
use
are
these
riches
to
that
man
if
all
the
world
be
virtuous
and
a
man
steeped
in
vice
what
good
results
are
forthcoming
from
him
if
all
the
world
be
resplendent
and
a
man
blind
where
are
his
benefits
if
all
the
world
be
in
plenty
and
a
man
hungry
what
sustenance
does
he
derive
therefore
every
man
must
be
an
investigator
for
himself
ideas
and
beliefs
left
by
his
fathers
and
ancestors
as
a
heritage
will
not
suffice
for
adherence
to
these
are
but
imitations
and
imitations
have
ever
been
a
cause
of
disappointment
and
misguidance
be
investigators
of
reality
that
you
may
attain
the
verity
of
truth
and
life
you
have
asked
why
it
was
necessary
for
the
soul
that
was
from
god
to
make
this
journey
back
to
god
would
you
like
to
understand
the
reality
of
this
question
just
as
i
teach
it
or
do
you
wish
to
hear
it
as
the
world
teaches
itfor
if
i
should
answer
you
according
to
the
latter
way
this
would
be
but
imitation
and
would
not
make
the
subject
clear
the
reality
underlying
this
question
is
that
the
evil
spirit
satan
or
whatever
is
interpreted
as
evil
refers
to
the
lower
nature
in
man
this
baser
nature
is
symbolized
in
various
ways
in
man
there
are
two
expressions
one
is
the
expression
of
nature
the
other
the
expression
of
the
spiritual
realm
the
world
of
nature
is
defective
look
at
it
clearly
casting
aside
all
superstition
and
imagination
if
you
should
leave
a
man
uneducated
and
barbarous
in
the
wilds
of
africa
would
there
be
any
doubt
about
his
remaining
ignorant
god
has
never
created
an
evil
spirit
all
such
ideas
and
nomenclature
are
symbols
expressing
the
mere
human
or
earthly
nature
of
man
it
is
an
essential
condition
of
the
soil
of
earth
that
thorns
weeds
and
fruitless
trees
may
grow
from
it
relatively
speaking
this
is
evil
it
is
simply
the
lower
state
and
baser
product
of
nature
it
is
evident
therefore
that
man
is
in
need
of
divine
education
and
inspiration
that
the
spirit
and
bounties
of
god
are
essential
to
his
development
that
is
to
say
the
teachings
of
christ
and
the
prophets
are
necessary
for
his
education
and
guidance
why
because
they
are
the
divine
gardeners
who
till
the
earth
of
human
hearts
and
minds
they
educate
man
uproot
the
weeds
burn
the
thorns
and
remodel
the
waste
places
into
gardens
and
orchards
where
fruitful
trees
grow
the
wisdom
and
purpose
of
their
training
is
that
man
must
pass
from
degree
to
degree
of
progressive
unfoldment
until
perfection
is
attained
for
instance
if
a
man
should
live
his
entire
life
in
one
city
he
cannot
gain
a
knowledge
of
the
whole
world
to
become
perfectly
informed
he
must
visit
other
cities
see
the
mountains
and
valleys
cross
the
rivers
and
traverse
the
plains
in
other
words
without
progressive
and
universal
education
perfection
will
not
be
attained
man
must
walk
in
many
paths
and
be
subjected
to
various
processes
in
his
evolution
upward
physically
he
is
not
born
in
full
stature
but
passes
through
consecutive
stages
of
foetus
infant
childhood
youth
maturity
and
old
age
suppose
he
had
the
power
to
remain
young
throughout
his
life
he
then
would
not
understand
the
meaning
of
old
age
and
could
not
believe
it
existed
if
he
could
not
realize
the
condition
of
old
age
he
would
not
know
that
he
was
young
he
would
not
know
the
difference
between
young
and
old
without
experiencing
the
old
unless
you
have
passed
through
the
state
of
infancy
how
would
you
know
this
was
an
infant
beside
you
if
there
was
no
wrong
how
would
you
recognize
the
right
if
it
were
not
for
sin
how
would
you
appreciate
virtue
if
evil
deeds
were
unknown
how
could
you
commend
good
actions
if
sickness
did
not
exist
how
would
you
understand
health
evil
is
nonexistent
it
is
the
absence
of
good
sickness
is
the
loss
of
health
poverty
the
lack
of
riches
when
wealth
disappears
you
are
poor
you
look
within
the
treasure
box
but
find
nothing
there
without
knowledge
there
is
ignorance
therefore
ignorance
is
simply
the
lack
of
knowledge
death
is
the
absence
of
life
therefore
on
the
one
hand
we
have
existence
on
the
other
nonexistence
negation
or
absence
of
existence
briefly
the
journey
of
the
soul
is
necessary
the
pathway
of
life
is
the
road
which
leads
to
divine
knowledge
and
attainment
without
training
and
guidance
the
soul
could
never
progress
beyond
the
conditions
of
its
lower
nature
which
is
ignorant
and
defective
religion
essential
and
nonessential
the
world
of
existence
is
an
emanation
of
the
merciful
attribute
of
god
god
has
shone
forth
upon
the
phenomena
of
being
through
his
effulgence
of
mercy
and
he
is
clement
and
kind
to
all
his
creation
therefore
the
world
of
humanity
must
ever
be
the
recipient
of
bounties
from
the
eternal
lord
even
as
his
holiness
christ
has
declared
be
ye
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
for
his
bounties
like
the
light
and
heat
of
the
sun
in
the
material
heavens
descend
alike
upon
all
mankind
consequently
man
must
learn
the
lesson
of
kindness
and
beneficence
from
god
himself
just
as
god
is
kind
to
all
humanity
man
also
must
be
kind
to
his
fellow
creatures
if
his
attitude
is
just
and
loving
toward
his
fellow
men
toward
all
creation
then
indeed
is
he
worthy
of
being
pronounced
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
brotherhood
or
fraternity
is
of
different
kinds
it
may
be
family
association
the
intimate
relationship
of
the
household
this
is
limited
and
subject
to
change
and
disruption
how
often
it
happens
that
in
a
family
love
and
agreement
are
changed
into
enmity
and
antagonism
another
form
of
fraternity
is
manifest
in
patriotism
man
loves
his
fellowmen
because
they
belong
to
the
same
nativity
this
is
also
limited
and
subject
to
change
and
disintegration
as
for
instance
when
sons
of
the
same
fatherland
are
opposed
to
each
other
in
war
bloodshed
and
battle
still
another
brotherhood
or
fraternity
is
that
which
arises
from
racial
unity
the
oneness
of
racial
origin
producing
ties
of
affinity
and
association
this
likewise
has
its
limitation
and
liability
to
change
for
often
war
and
deadly
strife
have
been
witnessed
between
people
and
nations
of
the
same
racial
lineage
there
is
a
fourth
kind
of
brotherhood
the
attitude
of
man
toward
humanity
itself
the
altruistic
love
of
humankind
and
recognition
of
the
fundamental
human
bond
although
this
is
unlimited
it
is
nevertheless
susceptible
to
change
and
destruction
even
from
this
universal
fraternal
bond
the
lookedfor
result
does
not
appear
what
is
the
lookedfor
result
lovingkindness
among
all
human
creatures
and
a
firm
indestructible
brotherhood
which
includes
all
the
divine
possibilities
and
significances
in
humanity
therefore
it
is
evident
that
fraternity
love
and
kindness
based
upon
family
nativity
race
or
an
attitude
of
altruism
are
neither
sufficient
nor
permanent
since
all
of
them
are
limited
restricted
and
liable
to
change
and
disruption
for
in
the
family
there
is
discord
and
alienation
among
sons
of
the
same
fatherland
strife
and
internecine
warfare
are
witnessed
between
those
of
a
given
race
hostility
and
hatred
are
frequent
and
even
among
the
altruists
varying
aspects
of
opinion
and
lack
of
unselfish
devotion
give
little
promise
of
permanent
and
indestructible
unity
among
mankind
therefore
the
lord
of
mankind
has
caused
his
holy
divine
manifestations
to
come
into
the
world
he
has
revealed
his
heavenly
books
in
order
to
establish
spiritual
brotherhood
and
through
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
has
made
it
practicable
for
perfect
fraternity
to
be
realized
among
mankind
and
when
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
this
perfect
fraternity
and
agreement
are
established
amongst
men
this
brotherhood
and
love
being
spiritual
in
character
this
lovingkindness
being
heavenly
these
constraining
bonds
being
divine
a
unity
appears
which
is
indissoluble
unchanging
and
never
subject
to
transformation
it
is
ever
the
same
and
will
forever
remain
the
same
for
example
consider
the
foundation
of
the
brotherhood
laid
by
his
holiness
christ
observe
how
that
fraternity
was
conducive
to
unity
and
accord
and
how
it
brought
various
souls
to
a
plane
of
uniform
attainment
where
they
were
willing
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
each
other
they
were
content
to
renounce
possessions
and
ready
to
joyously
forfeit
life
itself
they
lived
together
in
such
love
and
fellowship
that
even
galen
the
famous
greek
philosopher
who
was
not
a
christian
in
his
work
entitled
the
progress
of
the
nations
says
that
religious
beliefs
are
greatly
conducive
to
the
foundation
of
real
civilization
as
a
proof
thereof
he
says
a
certain
number
of
people
contemporaneous
with
us
are
known
as
christians
these
enjoy
the
superlative
degree
of
moral
civilization
each
one
of
them
is
a
great
philosopher
because
they
live
together
in
the
utmost
love
and
goodfellowship
they
sacrifice
life
for
each
other
they
offer
worldly
possessions
for
each
other
you
can
say
of
the
christian
people
that
they
are
as
one
person
there
is
a
bond
amongst
them
that
is
indissoluble
in
character
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
foundation
of
real
brotherhood
the
cause
of
loving
cooperation
and
reciprocity
and
the
source
of
real
kindness
and
unselfish
devotion
is
none
other
than
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
without
this
influence
and
animus
it
is
impossible
we
may
be
able
to
realize
some
degrees
of
fraternity
through
other
motives
but
these
are
limited
associations
and
subject
to
change
when
human
brotherhood
is
founded
upon
the
holy
spirit
it
is
eternal
changeless
unlimited
in
various
parts
of
the
orient
there
was
a
time
when
brotherhood
lovingkindness
and
all
the
praiseworthy
qualities
of
mankind
seemed
to
have
disappeared
there
was
no
evidence
of
patriotic
religious
or
racial
fraternity
but
conditions
of
bigotry
hatred
and
prejudice
prevailed
instead
the
adherents
of
each
religion
were
violent
enemies
of
the
others
filled
with
the
spirit
of
hostility
and
eager
for
shedding
of
blood
the
present
war
in
the
balkans
furnishes
a
parallel
of
these
conditions
consider
the
bloodshed
ferocity
and
oppression
manifested
there
even
in
this
enlightened
century
all
of
it
based
fundamentally
upon
religious
prejudice
and
disagreement
for
the
nations
involved
belong
to
the
same
races
and
nativities
nevertheless
they
are
savage
and
merciless
toward
each
other
similar
deplorable
conditions
prevailed
in
persia
in
the
nineteenth
century
darkness
and
ignorant
fanaticism
were
widespread
no
trace
of
fellowship
or
brotherhood
existed
amongst
the
races
on
the
contrary
human
hearts
were
filled
with
rage
and
hatred
darkness
and
gloom
were
manifest
in
human
lives
and
conditions
everywhere
at
such
a
time
as
this
his
holiness
bahaullah
appeared
upon
the
divine
horizon
even
as
the
glory
of
the
sun
and
in
that
gross
darkness
and
hopelessness
of
the
human
world
there
shone
a
great
light
he
founded
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
declaring
that
all
mankind
are
as
sheep
and
that
god
is
the
real
and
true
shepherd
the
shepherd
is
one
and
all
people
are
of
his
flock
the
world
of
humanity
is
one
and
god
is
equally
kind
to
all
what
then
is
the
source
of
unkindness
and
hatred
in
the
human
world
this
real
shepherd
loves
all
his
sheep
he
leads
them
in
green
pastures
he
rears
and
protects
them
what
then
is
the
source
of
enmity
and
alienation
among
humankind
whence
this
conflict
and
strife
the
real
underlying
cause
is
lack
of
religious
unity
and
association
for
in
each
of
the
great
religions
we
find
superstition
blind
imitation
of
creeds
and
theological
formulae
adhered
to
instead
of
the
divine
fundamentals
causing
difference
and
divergence
among
mankind
instead
of
agreement
and
fellowship
consequently
strife
hatred
and
warfare
have
arisen
based
upon
this
divergence
and
separation
if
we
investigate
the
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
we
find
them
to
be
one
absolutely
changeless
and
never
subject
to
transformation
for
example
each
of
the
divine
religions
contains
two
kinds
of
laws
or
ordinances
one
division
concerns
the
world
of
morality
and
ethical
institutions
these
are
the
essential
ordinances
they
instill
and
awaken
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
love
for
humanity
the
virtues
of
the
world
of
mankind
the
attributes
of
the
divine
kingdom
rebirth
and
resurrection
from
the
kingdom
of
nature
these
constitute
one
kind
of
divine
law
which
is
common
to
all
and
never
subject
to
change
from
the
dawn
of
the
adamic
cycle
to
the
present
day
this
fundamental
law
of
god
has
continued
changeless
this
is
the
foundation
of
divine
religion
the
second
division
comprises
laws
and
institutions
which
provide
for
human
needs
and
conditions
according
to
exigencies
of
time
and
place
these
are
accidental
of
no
essential
importance
and
should
never
have
been
made
the
cause
and
source
of
human
contention
for
example
during
the
time
of
his
holiness
mosesupon
him
be
peace
according
to
the
exigencies
of
that
period
divorce
was
permissible
during
the
cycle
of
his
holiness
christ
inasmuch
as
divorce
was
not
in
conformity
with
the
time
and
conditions
his
holiness
jesus
christ
abrogated
it
in
the
cycle
of
moses
plurality
of
wives
was
permissible
but
during
the
time
of
his
holiness
christ
the
exigency
which
had
sanctioned
it
did
not
exist
therefore
it
was
forbidden
his
holiness
moses
lived
in
the
wilderness
and
desert
of
sinai
therefore
his
ordinances
and
commandments
were
in
conformity
with
those
conditions
the
penalty
for
theft
was
to
cut
off
a
mans
hand
an
ordinance
of
this
kind
was
in
keeping
with
desert
life
but
not
compatible
with
conditions
of
the
present
day
such
ordinances
therefore
constitute
the
second
or
nonessential
division
of
the
divine
religions
and
are
not
of
importance
for
they
deal
with
human
transactions
which
are
ever
changing
according
to
the
requirements
of
time
and
place
therefore
the
intrinsic
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
are
one
as
this
is
true
why
should
hostility
and
strife
exist
among
them
why
should
this
hatred
and
warfare
ferocity
and
bloodshed
continue
is
this
allowable
and
justified
god
forbid
religion
renewed
creation
is
the
expression
of
motion
motion
is
life
a
moving
object
is
a
living
object
whereas
that
which
is
motionless
and
inert
is
as
dead
all
created
forms
are
progressive
in
their
planes
or
kingdoms
of
existence
under
the
stimulus
of
the
power
or
spirit
of
life
the
universal
energy
is
dynamic
nothing
is
stationary
in
the
material
world
of
outer
phenomena
or
in
the
inner
world
of
intellect
and
consciousness
religion
is
the
outer
expression
of
the
divine
reality
therefore
it
must
be
living
vitalized
moving
and
progressive
if
it
be
without
motion
and
nonprogressive
it
is
without
the
divine
life
it
is
dead
the
divine
institutes
are
continuously
active
and
evolutionary
therefore
the
revelation
of
them
must
be
progressive
and
continuous
all
things
are
subject
to
reformation
this
is
a
century
of
life
and
renewal
sciences
and
arts
industry
and
invention
have
been
reformed
law
and
ethics
have
been
reconstituted
reorganized
the
world
of
thought
has
been
regenerated
sciences
of
former
ages
and
philosophies
of
the
past
are
useless
today
present
exigencies
demand
new
methods
of
solution
world
problems
are
without
precedent
old
ideas
and
modes
of
thought
are
fast
becoming
obsolete
ancient
laws
and
archaic
ethical
systems
will
not
meet
the
requirements
of
modern
conditions
for
this
is
clearly
the
century
of
a
new
life
the
century
of
the
revelation
of
the
reality
and
therefore
the
greatest
of
all
centuries
consider
how
the
scientific
developments
of
fifty
years
have
surpassed
and
eclipsed
the
knowledge
and
achievements
of
all
the
former
ages
combined
would
the
announcements
and
theories
of
ancient
astronomers
explain
our
present
knowledge
of
the
sunworlds
and
planetary
systems
would
the
mask
of
obscurity
which
beclouded
mediaeval
centuries
meet
the
demand
for
cleareyed
vision
and
understanding
which
characterizes
the
world
today
in
view
of
this
shall
blind
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
and
theological
interpretations
continue
to
guide
and
control
the
religious
life
and
spiritual
development
of
humanity
today
shall
man
gifted
with
the
power
of
reason
unthinkingly
follow
and
adhere
to
dogma
creeds
and
hereditary
beliefs
which
will
not
bear
the
analysis
of
reason
in
this
century
of
effulgent
reality
unquestionably
this
will
not
satisfy
men
of
science
for
when
they
find
premise
or
conclusion
contrary
to
present
standards
of
proof
and
without
real
foundation
they
reject
that
which
has
been
formerly
accepted
as
standard
and
correct
and
move
forward
from
new
foundations
the
divine
prophets
have
revealed
and
founded
religion
they
have
laid
down
certain
laws
and
heavenly
principles
for
the
guidance
of
mankind
they
have
taught
and
promulgated
the
knowledge
of
god
established
praiseworthy
ethical
ideals
and
inculcated
the
highest
standards
of
virtue
in
the
human
world
gradually
these
heavenly
teachings
and
foundations
of
reality
have
been
beclouded
by
human
interpretations
and
dogmatic
imitations
of
ancestral
beliefs
the
essential
realities
which
the
prophets
labored
so
hard
to
establish
in
human
hearts
and
minds
while
undergoing
ordeals
and
suffering
tortures
of
persecution
have
now
well
nigh
vanished
some
of
these
heavenly
messengers
have
been
killed
some
imprisoned
all
of
them
despised
and
rejected
while
proclaiming
the
reality
of
divinity
soon
after
their
departure
from
this
world
the
essential
truth
of
their
teachings
was
lost
sight
of
and
dogmatic
imitations
adhered
to
inasmuch
as
human
interpretations
and
blind
imitations
differ
widely
religious
strife
and
disagreement
have
arisen
among
mankind
the
light
of
true
religion
has
been
extinguished
and
the
unity
of
the
world
of
humanity
destroyed
the
prophets
of
god
voiced
the
spirit
of
unity
and
agreement
they
have
been
the
founders
of
divine
reality
therefore
if
the
nations
of
the
world
forsake
imitations
and
investigate
the
reality
underlying
the
revealed
word
of
god
they
will
agree
and
become
reconciled
for
reality
is
one
and
not
multiple
the
nations
and
religions
are
steeped
in
blind
and
bigoted
imitations
a
man
is
a
jew
because
his
father
was
a
jew
the
mohammedan
follows
implicitly
the
footsteps
of
his
ancestors
in
belief
and
observance
the
buddhist
is
true
to
his
heredity
as
a
buddhist
that
is
to
say
they
profess
religious
belief
blindly
and
without
investigation
making
unity
and
agreement
impossible
it
is
evident
therefore
that
this
condition
will
not
be
remedied
without
a
reformation
in
the
world
of
religion
in
other
words
the
fundamental
reality
of
the
divine
religions
must
be
renewed
reformed
revoiced
to
mankind
from
the
seed
of
reality
religion
has
grown
into
a
tree
which
has
put
forth
leaves
and
branches
blossoms
and
fruit
after
a
time
this
tree
has
fallen
into
a
condition
of
decay
the
leaves
and
blossoms
have
withered
and
perished
the
tree
has
become
stricken
and
fruitless
it
is
not
reasonable
that
man
should
hold
to
the
old
tree
claiming
that
its
life
forces
are
undiminished
its
fruit
unequalled
its
existence
eternal
the
seed
of
reality
must
be
sown
again
in
human
hearts
in
order
that
a
new
tree
may
grow
therefrom
and
new
divine
fruits
refresh
the
world
by
this
means
the
nations
and
peoples
now
divergent
in
religion
will
be
brought
into
unity
imitations
will
be
forsaken
and
a
universal
brotherhood
in
the
reality
itself
will
be
established
warfare
and
strife
will
cease
among
mankind
all
will
be
reconciled
as
servants
of
god
for
all
are
sheltered
beneath
the
tree
of
his
providence
and
mercy
god
is
kind
to
all
he
is
the
giver
of
bounty
to
all
alike
even
as
his
holiness
jesus
christ
has
declared
that
god
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
that
is
to
say
the
mercy
of
god
is
universal
all
humanity
is
under
the
protection
of
his
love
and
favor
and
unto
all
he
has
pointed
the
way
of
guidance
and
progress
progress
is
of
two
kinds
material
and
spiritual
the
former
is
attained
through
observation
of
the
surrounding
existence
and
constitutes
the
foundation
of
civilization
spiritual
progress
is
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
is
the
awakening
of
the
conscious
soul
of
man
to
perceive
the
reality
of
divinity
material
progress
insures
the
happiness
of
the
human
world
spiritual
progress
insures
the
happiness
and
eternal
continuance
of
the
soul
the
prophets
of
god
have
founded
the
laws
of
divine
civilization
they
have
been
the
root
and
fundamental
source
of
all
knowledge
they
have
established
the
principles
of
human
brotherhood
or
fraternity
which
is
of
various
kinds
such
as
the
fraternity
of
family
of
race
of
nation
and
of
ethical
motives
these
forms
of
fraternity
these
bonds
of
brotherhood
are
merely
temporal
and
transient
in
association
they
do
not
insure
harmony
and
are
usually
productive
of
disagreement
they
do
not
prevent
warfare
and
strife
on
the
contrary
they
are
selfish
restricted
and
fruitful
causes
of
enmity
and
hatred
among
mankind
the
spiritual
brotherhood
which
is
enkindled
and
established
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
unites
nations
and
removes
the
cause
of
warfare
and
strife
it
transforms
mankind
into
one
great
family
and
establishes
the
foundations
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
it
promulgates
the
spirit
of
international
agreement
and
insures
universal
peace
therefore
we
must
investigate
the
foundation
reality
of
this
heavenly
fraternity
we
must
forsake
all
imitations
and
promote
the
reality
of
the
divine
teachings
in
accordance
with
these
principles
and
actions
and
by
the
assistance
of
the
holy
spirit
both
material
and
spiritual
happiness
shall
become
realized
until
all
nations
and
peoples
become
united
by
the
bonds
of
the
holy
spirit
in
this
real
fraternity
until
national
and
international
prejudices
are
effaced
in
the
reality
of
this
spiritual
brotherhood
true
progress
prosperity
and
lasting
happiness
will
not
be
attained
by
man
this
is
the
century
of
new
and
universal
nationhood
sciences
have
advanced
industries
have
progressed
politics
have
been
reformed
liberty
has
been
proclaimed
justice
is
awakening
this
is
the
century
of
motion
divine
stimulus
and
accomplishment
the
century
of
human
solidarity
and
altruistic
service
the
century
of
universal
peace
and
the
reality
of
the
divine
kingdom
divine
love
every
subject
presented
to
a
thoughtful
audience
must
be
supported
by
rational
proofs
and
logical
arguments
proofs
are
of
four
kinds
first
through
senseperception
second
through
the
reasoning
faculty
third
from
traditional
or
scriptural
authority
fourth
through
the
medium
of
inspiration
that
is
to
say
there
are
four
criterions
or
standards
of
judgment
by
which
the
human
mind
reaches
its
conclusions
we
will
first
consider
the
criterion
of
the
senses
this
is
a
standard
still
held
to
by
the
materialistic
philosophers
of
the
world
they
believe
that
whatever
is
perceptible
to
the
senses
is
a
verity
a
certainty
and
without
doubt
existent
for
example
they
say
here
is
a
lamp
which
you
see
and
because
it
is
perceptible
to
the
sense
of
sight
you
cannot
doubt
its
existence
there
is
a
tree
your
sense
of
vision
assures
you
of
its
reality
which
is
beyond
question
this
is
a
man
you
see
that
he
is
a
man
therefore
he
exists
in
a
word
everything
confirmed
by
the
senses
is
assumed
to
be
as
undoubted
and
unquestioned
as
the
product
of
five
multiplied
by
five
it
cannot
be
twentysix
nor
less
than
twentyfive
consequently
the
materialistic
philosophers
consider
the
criterion
of
the
senses
to
be
first
and
foremost
but
in
the
estimation
of
the
divine
philosophers
this
proof
and
assurance
is
not
reliable
nay
rather
they
deem
the
standard
of
the
senses
to
be
false
because
it
is
imperfect
sight
for
instance
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
senses
yet
it
is
subject
to
many
aberrations
and
inaccuracies
the
eye
sees
the
mirage
as
a
body
of
water
regards
images
in
the
mirror
as
realities
when
they
are
but
reflections
a
man
sailing
upon
the
river
imagines
that
objects
upon
the
shore
are
moving
whereas
he
is
in
motion
and
they
are
stationary
to
the
eye
the
earth
appears
fixed
while
the
sun
and
stars
revolve
about
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
heavenly
orbs
are
stationary
and
the
earth
turning
upon
its
axis
the
colossal
suns
planets
and
constellations
which
shine
in
the
heavens
appear
small
nay
infinitesimal
to
human
vision
whereas
in
reality
they
are
vastly
greater
than
the
earth
in
dimension
and
volume
a
whirling
spark
appears
to
the
sight
as
a
circle
of
fire
there
are
numberless
instances
of
this
kind
which
show
the
error
and
inaccuracy
of
the
senses
therefore
the
divine
philosophers
have
considered
this
standard
of
judgment
to
be
defective
and
unreliable
the
second
criterion
is
that
of
the
intellect
the
ancient
philosophers
in
particular
considered
the
intellect
to
be
the
most
important
agency
of
judgment
among
the
wise
men
of
greece
rome
persia
and
egypt
the
criterion
of
true
proof
was
reason
they
held
that
every
matter
submitted
to
the
reasoning
faculty
could
be
proved
true
or
false
and
must
be
accepted
or
rejected
accordingly
but
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
of
insight
this
criterion
is
likewise
defective
and
unreliable
for
these
same
philosophers
who
held
to
reason
or
intellect
as
the
standard
of
human
judgment
have
differed
widely
among
themselves
upon
every
subject
of
investigation
the
statements
of
the
greek
philosophers
are
contradictory
to
the
conclusions
of
the
persian
sages
even
among
the
greek
philosophers
themselves
there
is
continual
variance
and
lack
of
agreement
upon
any
given
subject
great
difference
of
thought
also
prevailed
between
the
wise
men
of
greece
and
rome
therefore
if
the
criterion
of
reason
or
intellect
constituted
a
correct
and
infallible
standard
of
judgment
those
who
tested
and
applied
it
should
have
arrived
at
the
same
conclusions
as
they
differ
and
are
contradictory
in
conclusions
it
is
an
evidence
that
the
method
and
standard
of
test
must
have
been
faulty
and
insufficient
the
third
criterion
or
standard
of
proof
is
traditional
or
scriptural
namely
that
every
statement
of
conclusion
should
be
supported
by
traditions
recorded
in
certain
religious
books
when
we
come
to
consider
even
the
holy
booksthe
books
of
godwe
are
led
to
ask
who
understands
these
books
by
what
authority
of
explanation
may
these
books
be
understood
it
must
be
the
authority
of
human
reason
and
if
reason
or
intellect
finds
itself
incapable
of
explaining
certain
questions
or
if
the
possessors
of
intellect
contradict
each
other
in
the
interpretation
of
traditions
how
can
such
a
criterion
be
relied
upon
for
accurate
conclusions
the
fourth
standard
is
that
of
inspiration
in
past
centuries
many
philosophers
have
claimed
illumination
or
revelation
prefacing
their
statements
by
the
announcement
that
this
subject
has
been
revealed
through
me
or
thus
do
i
speak
by
inspiration
of
this
class
were
the
philosophers
of
the
illuminati
inspirations
are
the
promptings
or
susceptibilities
of
the
human
heart
the
promptings
of
the
heart
are
sometimes
satanic
how
are
we
to
differentiate
them
how
are
we
to
tell
whether
a
given
statement
is
an
inspiration
and
prompting
of
the
heart
through
the
merciful
assistance
or
through
the
satanic
agency
consequently
it
has
become
evident
that
the
four
criterions
or
standards
of
judgment
by
which
the
human
mind
reaches
its
conclusions
are
faulty
and
inaccurate
all
of
them
are
liable
to
mistake
and
error
in
conclusions
but
a
statement
presented
to
the
mind
accompanied
by
proofs
which
the
senses
can
perceive
to
be
correct
which
the
faculty
of
reason
can
accept
which
is
in
accord
with
traditional
authority
and
sanctioned
by
the
promptings
of
the
heart
can
be
adjudged
and
relied
upon
as
perfectly
correct
for
it
has
been
proved
and
tested
by
all
the
standards
of
judgment
and
found
to
be
complete
when
we
apply
but
one
test
there
are
possibilities
of
mistake
this
is
selfevident
and
manifest
we
will
now
consider
the
subject
of
love
which
has
been
suggested
submitting
it
to
the
four
standards
of
judgment
and
thereby
reaching
our
conclusions
we
declare
that
love
is
the
cause
of
the
existence
of
all
phenomena
and
that
the
absence
of
love
is
the
cause
of
disintegration
or
nonexistence
love
is
the
conscious
bestowal
of
god
the
bond
of
affiliation
in
all
phenomena
we
will
first
consider
the
proof
of
this
through
senseperception
as
we
look
upon
the
universe
we
observe
that
all
composite
beings
or
existing
phenomena
are
made
up
primarily
of
single
elements
bound
together
by
a
power
of
attraction
through
this
power
of
attraction
cohesion
has
become
manifest
between
atoms
of
these
composing
elements
the
resultant
being
is
a
phenomenon
of
the
lower
contingent
type
the
power
of
cohesion
expressed
in
the
mineral
kingdom
is
in
reality
love
or
affinity
manifested
in
a
low
degree
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
mineral
world
we
take
a
step
higher
into
the
vegetable
kingdom
where
we
find
an
increased
power
of
attraction
has
become
manifest
among
the
composing
elements
which
form
phenomena
through
this
degree
of
attraction
a
cellular
admixture
is
produced
among
these
elements
which
make
up
the
body
of
a
plant
therefore
in
the
degree
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
there
is
love
we
enter
the
animal
kingdom
and
find
the
attractive
power
binding
together
single
elements
as
in
the
mineral
plus
the
cellular
admixture
as
in
the
vegetable
plus
the
phenomena
of
feelings
or
susceptibilities
we
observe
that
the
animals
are
susceptible
to
certain
affiliation
and
fellowship
and
that
they
exercise
natural
selection
this
elemental
attraction
this
admixture
and
selective
affinity
is
love
manifest
in
the
degree
of
the
animal
kingdom
finally
we
come
to
the
kingdom
of
man
as
this
is
the
superior
kingdom
the
light
of
love
is
more
resplendent
in
man
we
find
the
power
of
attraction
among
the
elements
which
compose
his
material
body
plus
the
attraction
which
produces
cellular
admixture
or
power
augmentative
plus
the
attraction
which
characterizes
the
sensibilities
of
the
animal
kingdom
but
still
beyond
and
above
all
these
lower
powers
we
discover
in
the
being
of
man
the
attraction
of
heart
the
susceptibilities
and
affinities
which
bind
men
together
enabling
them
to
live
and
associate
in
friendship
and
solidarity
it
is
therefore
evident
that
in
the
world
of
humanity
the
greatest
king
and
sovereign
is
love
if
love
were
extinguished
the
power
of
attraction
dispelled
the
affinity
of
human
hearts
destroyed
the
phenomena
of
human
life
would
disappear
this
is
a
proof
perceptible
to
the
senses
acceptable
to
reason
in
accord
with
traditions
and
teachings
of
the
holy
books
and
verified
by
the
promptings
of
human
hearts
themselves
it
is
a
proof
upon
which
we
can
absolutely
rely
and
declare
to
be
complete
but
these
are
only
degrees
of
love
which
exist
in
the
natural
or
physical
world
their
manifestation
is
ever
according
to
the
requirement
of
natural
conditions
and
standards
real
love
is
the
love
which
exists
between
god
and
his
servants
the
love
which
binds
together
holy
souls
this
is
the
love
of
the
spiritual
world
not
the
love
of
physical
bodies
and
organisms
for
example
consider
and
observe
how
the
bestowals
of
god
successively
descend
upon
mankind
how
the
divine
effulgences
ever
shine
upon
the
human
world
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
these
bestowals
these
bounties
these
effulgences
emanate
from
love
unless
love
be
the
divine
motive
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
heart
of
man
to
attain
or
receive
them
unless
love
exists
the
divine
blessing
could
not
descend
upon
any
object
or
thing
unless
there
be
love
the
recipient
of
divine
effulgence
could
not
radiate
and
reflect
that
effulgence
upon
other
objects
if
we
are
of
those
who
perceive
we
realize
that
the
bounties
of
god
manifest
themselves
continuously
even
as
the
rays
of
the
sun
unceasingly
emanate
from
the
solar
center
the
phenomenal
world
through
the
resplendent
effulgence
of
the
sun
is
radiant
and
bright
in
the
same
way
the
realm
of
hearts
and
spirits
is
illumined
and
resuscitated
through
the
shining
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
and
the
bounties
of
the
love
of
god
thereby
the
world
of
existence
the
kingdom
of
hearts
and
spirits
is
ever
quickened
into
life
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
hearts
would
be
inanimate
spirits
would
wither
and
the
reality
of
man
would
be
bereft
of
the
everlasting
bestowals
consider
to
what
extent
the
love
of
god
makes
itself
manifest
among
the
signs
of
his
love
which
appear
in
the
world
are
the
dawningpoint
of
his
manifestations
what
an
infinite
degree
of
love
is
reflected
by
the
divine
manifestations
toward
mankind
for
the
sake
of
guiding
the
people
they
have
willingly
forfeited
their
lives
to
resuscitate
human
hearts
they
have
accepted
the
cross
to
enable
human
souls
to
attain
the
supreme
degree
of
advancement
they
have
suffered
during
their
limited
years
extreme
ordeals
and
difficulties
if
his
holiness
jesus
christ
had
not
possessed
love
for
the
world
of
humanity
surely
he
would
not
have
welcomed
the
cross
he
was
crucified
for
the
love
of
mankind
consider
the
infinite
degree
of
that
love
without
love
for
humanity
john
the
baptist
would
not
have
offered
his
life
it
has
been
likewise
with
all
the
prophets
and
holy
souls
if
his
holiness
the
bab
had
not
manifested
love
for
mankind
surely
he
would
not
have
offered
his
breast
for
a
thousand
bullets
if
his
holiness
bahaullah
had
not
been
aflame
with
love
for
humanity
he
would
not
have
willingly
accepted
forty
years
imprisonment
observe
how
rarely
human
souls
sacrifice
their
pleasure
or
comfort
for
others
how
improbable
that
a
man
would
offer
his
eye
or
suffer
himself
to
be
dismembered
for
the
benefit
of
another
yet
all
the
divine
manifestations
suffered
offered
their
lives
and
blood
sacrificed
their
existence
comfort
and
all
they
possessed
for
the
sake
of
mankind
therefore
consider
how
much
they
love
were
it
not
for
their
love
for
humanity
spiritual
love
would
be
mere
nomenclature
were
it
not
for
their
illumination
human
souls
would
not
be
radiant
how
effective
is
their
love
this
is
a
sign
of
the
love
of
god
a
ray
of
the
sun
of
reality
therefore
we
must
give
praise
unto
god
for
it
is
the
light
of
his
bounty
which
has
shone
upon
us
through
his
love
which
is
everlasting
his
divine
manifestations
have
offered
their
lives
through
love
for
us
consider
then
what
the
love
of
god
means
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
all
the
spirits
would
be
inanimate
the
meaning
of
this
is
not
physical
death
nay
rather
it
is
that
condition
concerning
which
his
holiness
christ
declared
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
for
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
the
hearts
would
not
be
illumined
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
the
pathway
of
the
kingdom
would
not
be
opened
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
the
holy
books
would
not
have
been
revealed
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
the
divine
prophets
would
not
have
been
sent
to
the
world
the
foundation
of
all
these
bestowals
is
the
love
of
god
therefore
in
the
human
world
there
is
no
greater
power
than
the
love
of
god
it
is
the
love
of
god
which
has
brought
us
together
here
tonight
it
is
the
love
of
god
which
is
affiliating
the
east
and
the
west
it
is
the
love
of
god
which
has
resuscitated
the
world
now
we
must
offer
thanks
to
god
that
such
a
great
bestowal
and
effulgence
has
been
revealed
to
us
we
come
to
another
aspect
of
our
subjectare
the
workings
and
effects
of
love
confined
to
this
world
or
do
they
extend
on
and
on
to
another
existence
will
its
influence
affect
our
existence
here
only
or
will
it
extend
to
the
life
everlasting
when
we
look
upon
the
human
kingdom
we
readily
observe
that
it
is
superior
to
all
others
in
the
differentiation
of
life
in
the
world
of
existence
there
are
four
degrees
or
kingdomsthe
mineral
vegetable
animal
and
human
the
mineral
kingdom
is
possessed
of
a
certain
virtue
which
we
term
cohesion
the
vegetable
kingdom
possesses
cohesive
properties
plus
the
power
of
growth
or
power
augmentative
the
animal
kingdom
is
possessed
of
the
virtues
of
the
mineral
and
vegetable
plus
the
powers
of
the
senses
but
the
animal
although
gifted
with
sensibilities
is
utterly
bereft
of
consciousness
absolutely
out
of
touch
with
the
world
of
consciousness
and
spirit
the
animal
possesses
no
powers
by
which
it
can
make
discoveries
which
lie
beyond
the
realm
of
the
senses
it
has
no
power
of
intellectual
origination
for
example
an
animal
located
in
europe
is
not
capable
of
discovering
the
continent
of
america
it
understands
only
phenomena
which
come
within
the
range
of
its
senses
and
instinct
it
cannot
abstractly
reason
out
anything
the
animal
cannot
conceive
of
the
earth
being
spherical
or
revolving
upon
its
axis
it
cannot
apprehend
that
the
little
stars
in
the
heavens
are
tremendous
worlds
vastly
greater
than
the
earth
the
animal
cannot
abstractly
conceive
of
intellect
of
these
powers
it
is
bereft
therefore
these
powers
are
peculiar
to
man
and
it
is
made
evident
that
in
the
human
kingdom
there
is
a
reality
of
which
the
animal
is
minus
what
is
that
reality
it
is
the
spirit
of
man
by
it
man
is
distinguished
above
all
the
other
phenomenal
kingdoms
although
he
possesses
all
the
virtues
of
the
lower
kingdoms
he
is
further
endowed
with
the
spiritual
faculty
the
heavenly
gift
of
consciousness
all
material
phenomena
are
subject
to
nature
all
material
organisms
are
captives
of
nature
none
of
them
can
deviate
in
the
slightest
from
the
law
of
nature
this
earth
these
great
mountains
the
animals
with
their
wonderful
powers
and
instincts
cannot
go
beyond
natural
limitations
all
things
are
captives
of
nature
except
man
man
is
the
sovereign
of
nature
he
breaks
natures
laws
though
an
animal
fitted
by
nature
to
live
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
he
flies
in
the
air
like
a
bird
sails
upon
the
ocean
and
dives
deep
beneath
its
waves
in
submarines
man
is
gifted
with
a
power
whereby
he
penetrates
and
discovers
the
laws
of
nature
brings
them
forth
from
the
world
of
invisibility
into
the
plane
of
visibility
electricity
was
once
a
latent
force
of
nature
according
to
natures
laws
it
should
remain
a
hidden
secret
but
the
spirit
of
man
discovered
it
brought
it
forth
from
its
secret
depository
and
made
its
phenomena
visible
it
is
evident
and
manifest
that
man
is
capable
of
breaking
natures
laws
how
does
he
accomplish
it
through
a
spirit
with
which
god
has
endowed
him
at
creation
this
is
a
proof
that
the
spirit
of
man
differentiates
and
distinguishes
him
above
all
the
lower
kingdoms
it
is
this
spirit
to
which
the
verse
in
the
old
testament
refers
when
it
states
that
man
has
been
created
after
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
the
spirit
of
man
alone
penetrates
the
realities
of
god
and
partakes
of
the
divine
bounties
the
foundation
of
religion
god
is
one
the
effulgence
of
god
is
one
and
humanity
constitutes
the
servants
of
that
one
god
god
is
kind
to
all
he
creates
and
provides
for
all
and
all
are
under
his
care
and
protection
the
sun
of
truth
the
word
of
god
shines
upon
all
mankind
the
divine
cloud
pours
down
its
precious
rain
the
gentle
zephyrs
of
his
mercy
blow
and
all
humanity
is
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
his
eternal
justice
and
lovingkindness
but
we
have
acted
contrary
to
the
will
and
goodpleasure
of
god
we
have
been
the
cause
of
enmity
and
disunion
we
have
separated
from
each
other
and
risen
against
each
other
in
opposition
and
strife
how
many
have
been
the
wars
between
peoples
and
nations
what
bloodshed
numberless
are
the
cities
and
homes
which
have
been
laid
waste
all
of
this
has
been
contrary
to
the
goodpleasure
of
god
for
he
hath
willed
love
for
humanity
he
is
clement
and
merciful
to
all
his
creatures
he
hath
ordained
amity
and
fellowship
amongst
men
most
regrettable
of
all
is
the
state
of
difference
and
divergence
we
have
created
between
each
other
in
the
name
of
religion
imagining
that
a
paramount
duty
in
our
religious
belief
is
that
of
alienation
and
estrangement
that
we
should
shun
each
other
and
consider
each
other
contaminated
with
error
and
infidelity
in
reality
the
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
are
one
and
the
same
the
differences
which
have
arisen
between
us
are
due
to
blind
imitations
of
dogmatic
beliefs
and
adherence
to
ancestral
forms
of
worship
his
holiness
abraham
was
the
founder
of
reality
his
holiness
moses
his
holiness
christ
his
holiness
mohammed
were
the
manifestations
of
reality
his
holiness
bahaullah
was
the
glory
of
reality
this
is
not
simply
an
assertion
it
will
be
proved
let
me
ask
your
closest
attention
in
considering
this
subject
the
divine
religions
embody
two
kinds
of
ordinances
first
those
which
constitute
essential
or
spiritual
teachings
of
the
word
of
god
these
are
faith
in
god
the
acquirement
of
the
virtues
which
characterize
perfect
manhood
praiseworthy
moralities
the
acquisition
of
the
bestowals
and
bounties
emanating
from
the
divine
effulgences
in
brief
the
ordinances
which
concern
the
realm
of
morals
and
ethics
this
is
the
fundamental
aspect
of
the
religion
of
god
and
this
is
of
the
highest
importance
because
knowledge
of
god
is
the
fundamental
requirement
of
man
man
must
comprehend
the
oneness
of
divinity
he
must
come
to
know
and
acknowledge
the
precepts
of
god
and
realize
for
a
certainty
that
the
ethical
development
of
humanity
is
dependent
upon
religion
he
must
get
rid
of
all
defects
and
seek
the
attainment
of
heavenly
virtues
in
order
that
he
may
prove
to
be
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
it
is
recorded
in
the
holy
bible
that
god
said
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
it
is
selfevident
that
the
image
and
likeness
mentioned
do
not
apply
to
the
form
and
semblance
of
a
human
being
because
the
reality
of
divinity
is
not
limited
to
any
form
or
figure
nay
rather
the
attributes
and
characteristics
of
god
are
intended
even
as
god
is
pronounced
to
be
just
man
must
likewise
be
just
as
god
is
loving
and
kind
to
all
men
man
must
likewise
manifest
lovingkindness
to
all
humanity
as
god
is
loyal
and
truthful
man
must
show
forth
the
same
attributes
in
the
human
world
even
as
god
exercises
mercy
toward
all
man
must
prove
himself
to
be
the
manifestation
of
mercy
in
a
word
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
constitute
the
virtues
of
god
and
man
is
intended
to
become
the
recipient
of
the
effulgences
of
divine
attributes
this
is
the
essential
foundation
of
all
the
divine
religions
the
reality
itself
common
to
all
his
holiness
abraham
promulgated
this
his
holiness
moses
proclaimed
it
his
holiness
christ
and
all
the
prophets
upheld
this
standard
and
aspect
of
divine
religion
secondly
laws
and
ordinances
which
are
temporary
and
nonessential
these
concern
human
transactions
and
relations
they
are
accidental
and
subject
to
change
according
to
the
exigencies
of
time
and
place
these
ordinances
are
neither
permanent
nor
fundamental
for
instance
during
the
time
of
noah
it
was
expedient
that
sea
foods
be
considered
as
lawful
therefore
god
commanded
noah
to
partake
of
all
marine
animal
life
during
the
time
of
moses
this
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
exigencies
of
israels
existence
therefore
a
second
command
was
revealed
partly
abrogating
the
law
concerning
marine
foods
during
the
time
of
abrahamupon
him
be
peacecamels
milk
was
considered
a
lawful
and
acceptable
food
likewise
the
flesh
of
the
camel
but
during
jacobs
time
because
of
a
certain
vow
he
made
this
became
unlawful
these
are
nonessential
temporary
laws
in
the
holy
bible
there
are
certain
commandments
which
according
to
those
bygone
times
constituted
the
very
spirit
of
the
age
the
very
light
of
that
period
for
example
according
to
the
law
of
the
torah
if
a
man
committed
theft
of
a
certain
amount
they
cut
off
his
hand
is
it
practicable
and
reasonable
in
this
present
day
to
cut
off
a
mans
hand
for
the
theft
of
a
dollar
in
the
torah
there
are
ten
ordinances
concerning
murder
could
these
be
made
effective
today
unquestionably
no
times
have
changed
according
to
the
explicit
text
of
the
bible
if
a
man
should
change
or
break
the
law
of
the
sabbath
or
if
he
should
touch
fire
on
the
sabbath
he
must
be
killed
today
such
a
law
is
abrogated
the
torah
declares
that
if
a
man
should
speak
a
disrespectful
word
to
his
father
he
should
suffer
the
penalty
of
death
is
this
possible
of
enforcement
now
no
human
conditions
have
undergone
changes
likewise
during
the
time
of
christ
certain
minor
ordinances
conformable
to
that
period
were
enforced
it
has
been
shown
conclusively
therefore
that
the
foundation
of
the
religion
of
god
remains
permanent
and
unchanging
it
is
that
fixed
foundation
which
insures
the
progress
and
stability
of
the
body
politic
and
the
illumination
of
humanity
it
has
ever
been
the
cause
of
love
and
justice
amongst
men
it
works
for
the
true
fellowship
and
unification
of
all
mankind
for
it
never
changes
and
is
not
subject
to
supersedure
the
accidental
or
nonessential
laws
which
regulate
the
transactions
of
the
social
body
and
everyday
affairs
of
life
are
changeable
and
subject
to
abrogation
let
me
ask
what
is
the
purpose
of
prophethood
why
has
god
sent
the
prophets
it
is
selfevident
that
the
prophets
are
the
educators
of
men
and
the
teachers
of
the
human
race
they
come
to
bestow
universal
education
upon
humanity
to
give
humanity
training
to
uplift
the
human
race
from
the
abyss
of
despair
and
desolation
and
enable
man
to
attain
the
apogee
of
advancement
and
glory
the
people
are
in
darkness
the
prophets
bring
them
into
the
realm
of
light
they
are
in
a
state
of
utter
imperfection
the
prophets
imbue
them
with
perfections
the
purpose
of
the
prophetic
mission
is
no
other
than
the
education
and
guidance
of
the
people
therefore
we
must
regard
and
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
man
who
is
thus
qualified
that
is
to
say
any
soul
who
proves
to
be
the
educator
of
mankind
and
the
teacher
of
the
human
race
is
undoubtedly
the
prophet
of
his
age
for
example
let
us
review
the
events
connected
with
the
history
of
his
holiness
mosesupon
him
be
peace
his
holiness
dwelt
in
midian
at
a
time
when
the
children
of
israel
were
in
captivity
and
bondage
in
the
land
of
egypt
subjected
to
every
tyranny
and
severe
oppression
they
were
illiterate
and
ignorant
undergoing
cruel
ordeals
and
experiences
they
were
in
such
a
state
of
helplessness
and
impotence
that
it
was
proverbial
to
state
that
one
egyptian
could
overcome
ten
israelites
at
such
a
time
as
this
and
under
such
forbidding
conditions
his
holiness
moses
appeared
and
shone
forth
with
a
heavenly
radiance
he
saved
israel
from
the
bondage
of
pharaoh
and
released
them
from
captivity
he
led
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
into
the
holy
land
they
had
been
scattered
and
broken
he
unified
and
disciplined
them
conferred
upon
them
the
blessing
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
they
had
been
slaves
he
made
them
princes
they
were
ignorant
he
made
them
learned
they
were
imperfect
he
enabled
them
to
attain
perfection
in
a
wordhe
led
them
out
of
their
condition
of
hopelessness
and
brought
them
to
efficiency
in
the
plane
of
confidence
and
valor
they
became
renowned
throughout
the
ancient
world
until
finally
in
the
zenith
and
splendor
of
their
new
civilization
the
glory
of
the
sovereignty
of
solomon
was
attained
through
the
guidance
and
training
of
his
holiness
moses
these
slaves
and
captives
became
the
dominating
people
amongst
the
nations
not
only
in
physical
and
military
superiority
were
they
renowned
but
in
all
the
degrees
of
arts
letters
and
refinement
their
fame
was
widespread
even
the
celebrated
philosophers
of
greece
journeyed
to
jerusalem
in
order
to
study
with
the
israelitish
sages
and
many
were
the
lessons
of
philosophy
and
wisdom
they
received
among
these
philosophers
was
the
famous
socrates
he
visited
the
holy
land
and
studied
with
the
prophets
of
israel
acquiring
principles
of
their
philosophical
teaching
and
a
knowledge
of
their
advanced
arts
and
sciences
after
his
return
to
greece
he
founded
the
system
known
as
the
unity
of
god
the
greek
people
rose
against
him
and
at
last
he
was
poisoned
in
the
presence
of
the
king
hippocrates
and
many
other
greek
philosophers
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
learned
israelitish
doctors
and
absorbed
their
expositions
of
wisdom
and
the
inner
truth
inasmuch
as
his
holiness
moses
through
the
influence
of
his
great
mission
was
instrumental
in
releasing
the
israelites
from
a
low
state
of
debasement
and
humiliation
establishing
them
in
a
station
of
prestige
and
glorification
disciplining
and
educating
them
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
reach
a
fair
and
just
judgment
in
regard
to
such
a
marvelous
teacher
for
in
this
great
accomplishment
he
stood
single
and
alone
could
he
have
made
such
a
change
and
brought
about
such
a
condition
among
these
people
without
the
sanction
and
assistance
of
a
heavenly
power
could
he
have
transformed
a
people
from
humiliation
to
glory
without
a
holy
and
divine
support
no
other
than
a
divine
power
could
have
done
this
therein
lies
the
proof
of
prophethood
because
the
mission
of
a
prophet
is
education
of
the
human
race
such
as
this
personage
accomplished
proving
him
to
be
a
mighty
prophet
among
the
prophets
and
his
book
the
very
book
of
god
this
is
a
rational
direct
and
perfect
proof
in
brief
his
holiness
mosesupon
whom
be
peacefounded
the
law
of
god
purified
the
morals
of
the
people
of
israel
and
gave
them
an
impetus
toward
nobler
and
higher
attainments
but
after
the
departure
of
his
holiness
moses
following
the
decline
of
the
glory
of
solomons
era
and
during
the
reign
of
jeroboam
there
came
a
great
change
in
this
nation
the
high
ethical
standards
and
spiritual
perfections
ceased
to
exist
conditions
and
morals
became
corrupt
religion
was
debased
and
the
perfect
principles
of
the
mosaic
law
were
obscured
in
superstition
and
polytheism
war
and
strife
arose
among
the
tribes
and
their
unity
was
destroyed
the
followers
of
jeroboam
declared
themselves
rightful
and
valid
in
kingly
succession
and
the
supporters
of
rehoboam
made
the
same
claim
finally
the
tribes
were
torn
asunder
by
hostility
and
hatred
the
glory
of
israel
was
eclipsed
and
so
complete
was
the
degradation
that
a
golden
calf
was
set
up
as
an
object
of
worship
in
the
city
of
tyre
thereupon
god
sent
elijah
the
prophet
who
redeemed
the
people
renewed
the
law
of
god
and
established
an
era
of
new
life
for
israel
history
shows
a
still
later
change
and
transformation
when
this
oneness
and
solidarity
were
followed
by
another
dispersion
of
the
tribes
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
invaded
the
holy
land
and
carried
away
captive
seventy
thousand
israelites
to
chaldea
where
the
greatest
reverses
trials
and
suffering
afflicted
these
unfortunate
people
then
the
prophets
of
god
again
reformed
and
reestablished
the
law
of
god
and
the
people
in
their
humiliation
again
followed
it
this
resulted
in
their
liberation
and
under
the
edict
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
there
was
a
return
to
the
holy
city
jerusalem
and
the
temple
of
solomon
were
rebuilt
and
the
glory
of
israel
was
restored
this
lasted
but
a
short
time
the
morality
of
the
people
declined
and
conditions
reached
an
extreme
degree
until
the
roman
general
titus
took
jerusalem
and
razed
it
to
its
foundations
pillage
and
conquest
completed
the
desolation
palestine
became
a
waste
and
wilderness
and
the
jews
fled
from
the
holy
land
of
their
ancestors
the
cause
of
this
disintegration
and
dispersion
was
the
departure
of
israel
from
the
foundation
of
the
law
of
god
revealed
by
moses
namely
the
acquisition
of
divine
virtues
morality
love
the
development
of
arts
and
sciences
and
the
spirit
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
i
now
wish
you
to
examine
certain
facts
and
statements
which
are
worthy
of
consideration
my
purpose
and
intention
is
to
remove
from
the
hearts
of
men
the
religious
enmity
and
hatred
which
have
fettered
them
and
to
bring
all
religions
into
agreement
and
unity
inasmuch
as
this
hatred
and
enmity
this
bigotry
and
intolerance
are
outcomes
of
misunderstandings
the
reality
of
religious
unity
will
appear
when
these
misunderstandings
are
dispelled
for
the
foundation
of
the
divine
religions
is
one
foundation
this
is
the
oneness
of
revelation
or
teaching
but
alas
we
have
turned
away
from
that
foundation
holding
tenaciously
to
various
dogmatic
forms
and
blind
imitation
of
ancestral
beliefs
this
is
the
real
cause
of
enmity
hatred
and
bloodshed
in
the
world
the
reason
of
alienation
and
estrangement
among
mankind
therefore
i
wish
you
to
be
very
just
and
fair
in
your
judgment
of
the
following
statements
during
the
time
that
the
people
of
israel
were
being
tossed
and
afflicted
by
the
conditions
i
have
named
his
holiness
jesus
christ
appeared
among
them
jesus
of
nazareth
was
a
jew
he
was
single
and
unaided
alone
and
unique
he
had
no
assistant
the
jews
at
once
pronounced
him
to
be
an
enemy
of
moses
they
declared
that
he
was
the
destroyer
of
the
mosaic
laws
and
ordinances
let
us
examine
the
facts
as
they
are
investigate
the
truth
and
reality
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
true
opinion
and
conclusion
for
a
completely
fair
opinion
upon
this
question
we
must
lay
aside
all
we
have
and
investigate
independently
this
personage
jesus
christ
declared
his
holiness
moses
to
have
been
the
prophet
of
god
and
pronounced
all
the
prophets
of
israel
as
sent
from
god
he
proclaimed
the
torah
the
very
book
of
god
summoned
all
to
conform
to
its
precepts
and
follow
its
teachings
it
is
a
historical
fact
that
during
a
period
of
fifteen
hundred
years
the
kings
of
israel
were
unable
to
promulgate
broadcast
the
religion
of
judaism
in
fact
during
that
period
the
name
and
history
of
moses
were
confined
to
the
boundaries
of
palestine
and
the
torah
was
a
book
well
known
only
in
that
country
but
through
his
holiness
christ
through
the
blessing
of
the
new
testament
of
jesus
christ
the
old
testament
the
torah
was
translated
into
six
hundred
different
tongues
and
spread
throughout
the
world
it
was
through
christianity
that
the
torah
reached
persia
before
that
time
there
was
no
knowledge
in
that
country
of
such
a
book
but
his
holiness
christ
caused
its
spread
and
acceptance
through
him
the
name
of
moses
was
elevated
and
revered
he
was
instrumental
in
publishing
the
name
and
greatness
of
the
israelitish
prophets
and
he
proved
to
the
world
that
the
israelites
constituted
the
people
of
god
which
of
the
kings
of
israel
could
have
accomplished
this
were
it
not
for
jesus
christ
would
the
bible
the
torah
have
reached
this
land
of
america
would
the
name
of
moses
be
spread
throughout
the
world
refer
to
history
everyone
knows
that
when
christianity
was
spread
there
was
a
simultaneous
spread
of
the
knowledge
of
judaism
and
the
torah
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
persia
there
was
not
a
single
volume
of
the
old
testament
until
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
caused
it
to
appear
everywhere
so
that
today
the
holy
bible
is
a
household
book
in
that
country
it
is
evident
then
that
christ
was
a
friend
of
moses
that
he
loved
and
believed
in
his
holiness
moses
otherwise
he
would
not
have
commemorated
his
name
and
prophethood
this
is
selfevident
therefore
christians
and
jews
should
have
the
greatest
love
for
each
other
because
the
founders
of
these
two
great
religions
have
been
in
perfect
agreement
in
book
and
teaching
their
followers
should
be
likewise
we
have
already
stated
the
valid
proofs
of
prophethood
we
find
the
very
evidences
of
the
validity
of
his
holiness
moses
were
witnessed
and
duplicated
in
his
holiness
christ
his
holiness
christ
was
also
a
unique
and
single
personage
born
of
the
lineage
of
israel
by
the
power
of
his
word
he
was
able
to
unite
people
of
the
roman
greek
chaldean
egyptian
and
assyrian
nations
whereas
they
had
been
cruel
bloodthirsty
and
hostile
killing
pillaging
and
taking
each
other
captive
he
cemented
them
together
in
a
perfect
bond
of
unity
and
love
he
caused
them
to
agree
and
become
reconciled
such
mighty
effects
were
the
results
of
the
manifestation
of
one
single
soul
this
proves
conclusively
that
his
holiness
christ
was
assisted
by
god
today
all
christians
admit
and
believe
that
his
holiness
moses
was
a
prophet
of
god
they
declare
that
his
book
was
the
book
of
god
that
the
prophets
of
israel
were
true
and
valid
and
that
the
people
of
israel
constituted
the
people
of
god
what
harm
has
come
from
this
what
harm
could
come
from
a
statement
by
the
jews
that
jesus
was
also
a
manifestation
of
the
word
of
god
have
the
christians
suffered
for
their
belief
in
moses
have
they
experienced
any
loss
of
religious
enthusiasm
or
witnessed
any
defeat
in
their
religious
belief
by
declaring
that
his
holiness
moses
was
a
prophet
of
god
that
the
torah
was
a
book
of
god
and
that
all
the
prophets
of
israel
were
prophets
of
god
it
is
evident
that
no
loss
comes
from
this
and
now
it
is
time
for
the
jews
to
declare
that
christ
was
the
word
of
god
and
then
this
enmity
between
two
great
religions
will
pass
away
for
two
thousand
years
this
enmity
and
religious
prejudice
have
continued
blood
has
been
shed
ordeals
have
been
suffered
these
few
words
will
remedy
the
difficulty
and
unite
two
great
religions
what
harm
could
follow
thisthat
just
as
the
christians
glorify
and
praise
the
name
of
moses
likewise
the
jews
should
commemorate
the
name
of
christ
declare
him
to
be
the
word
of
god
and
consider
him
as
one
of
the
chosen
messengers
of
god
a
few
words
concerning
the
koran
and
the
mohammedans
when
his
holiness
mohammed
appeared
he
spoke
of
moses
as
the
great
man
of
god
in
the
koran
he
refers
to
the
sayings
of
moses
in
seven
different
places
proclaims
him
a
prophet
and
the
possessor
of
a
book
the
founder
of
the
law
and
the
spirit
of
god
he
said
whosoever
believes
in
him
is
acceptable
in
the
estimation
of
god
and
whosoever
shuns
him
or
any
of
the
prophets
is
rejected
of
god
even
in
conclusion
he
calls
upon
his
own
relatives
saying
why
have
ye
shunned
and
not
believed
in
moses
why
have
ye
not
acknowledged
the
torah
why
have
ye
not
believed
in
the
jewish
prophets
in
a
certain
surat
of
the
koran
he
mentions
the
names
of
twentyeight
of
the
prophets
of
israel
praising
each
and
all
of
them
to
this
great
extent
he
has
ratified
and
commended
the
prophets
and
religion
of
israel
the
purport
is
thisthat
mohammed
praised
and
glorified
his
holiness
moses
and
confirmed
judaism
he
declared
that
whosoever
denies
moses
is
contaminated
and
even
if
he
repents
his
repentance
will
not
be
accepted
he
pronounced
his
own
relatives
infidels
and
impure
because
they
had
denied
the
prophets
he
said
because
you
have
not
believed
in
christ
because
you
have
not
believed
in
moses
because
you
have
not
believed
in
the
gospels
you
are
infidels
and
contaminated
in
this
way
mohammed
has
praised
the
torah
moses
christ
and
the
prophets
of
the
past
he
appeared
amongst
the
arabs
who
were
a
people
nomadic
and
illiterate
barbarous
in
nature
and
bloodthirsty
he
guided
and
trained
them
until
they
attained
a
high
degree
of
development
through
his
education
and
discipline
they
rose
from
the
lowest
levels
of
ignorance
to
the
heights
of
knowledge
becoming
masters
of
erudition
and
philosophy
we
see
therefore
that
the
proofs
applicable
to
one
prophet
are
equally
applicable
to
another
in
conclusion
since
the
prophets
themselves
the
founders
have
loved
praised
and
testified
of
each
other
why
should
we
disagree
and
be
alienated
god
is
one
he
is
the
shepherd
of
all
we
are
his
sheep
and
therefore
should
live
together
in
love
and
unity
we
should
manifest
the
spirit
of
justness
and
goodwill
toward
each
other
shall
we
do
this
or
shall
we
censure
and
pronounce
anathema
praising
ourselves
and
condemning
all
others
what
possible
good
can
come
from
such
attitude
and
action
on
the
contrary
nothing
but
enmity
and
hatred
injustice
and
inhumanity
can
possibly
result
has
not
this
been
the
greatest
cause
of
bloodshed
woe
and
tribulation
in
the
past
praise
be
to
god
you
are
living
in
a
land
of
freedom
you
are
blessed
with
men
of
learning
men
who
are
well
versed
in
the
comparative
study
of
religions
you
realize
the
need
of
unity
and
know
the
great
harm
which
comes
from
prejudice
and
superstition
i
ask
you
is
not
fellowship
and
brotherhood
preferable
to
enmity
and
hatred
in
society
and
community
the
answer
is
selfevident
love
and
fellowship
are
absolutely
needful
to
win
the
goodpleasure
of
god
which
is
the
goal
of
all
human
attainment
we
must
be
united
we
must
love
each
other
we
must
ever
praise
each
other
we
must
bestow
commendation
upon
all
people
thus
removing
the
discord
and
hatred
which
have
caused
alienation
amongst
men
otherwise
the
conditions
of
the
past
will
continue
praising
ourselves
and
condemning
others
religious
wars
will
have
no
end
and
religious
prejudice
the
prime
cause
of
this
havoc
and
tribulation
will
increase
this
must
be
abandoned
and
the
way
to
do
it
is
to
investigate
the
reality
which
underlies
all
the
religions
this
underlying
reality
is
the
love
of
humanity
for
god
is
one
and
humanity
is
one
and
the
only
creed
of
the
prophets
is
love
and
unity
the
quickening
spirit
today
the
human
world
is
in
need
of
a
great
power
by
which
these
glorious
principles
and
purposes
may
be
executed
the
cause
of
peace
is
a
very
great
cause
it
is
the
cause
of
god
and
all
the
forces
of
the
world
are
opposed
to
it
governments
for
instance
consider
militarism
as
the
step
to
human
progress
that
division
among
men
and
nations
is
the
cause
of
patriotism
and
honor
that
if
one
nation
attack
and
conquer
another
gaining
wealth
territory
and
glory
thereby
this
warfare
and
conquest
this
bloodshed
and
cruelty
are
the
cause
of
that
victorious
nations
advancement
and
prosperity
this
is
an
utter
mistake
compare
the
nations
of
the
world
to
the
members
of
a
family
a
family
is
a
nation
in
miniature
simply
enlarge
the
circle
of
the
household
and
you
have
the
nation
enlarge
the
circle
of
nations
and
you
have
all
humanity
the
conditions
surrounding
the
family
surround
the
nation
the
happenings
in
the
family
are
the
happenings
in
the
life
of
the
nation
would
it
add
to
the
progress
and
advancement
of
a
family
if
dissensions
should
arise
among
its
members
fighting
pillaging
each
other
jealous
and
revengeful
of
injury
seeking
selfish
advantage
nay
this
would
be
the
cause
of
the
effacement
of
progress
and
advancement
so
it
is
in
the
great
family
of
nations
for
nations
are
but
an
aggregate
of
families
therefore
as
strife
and
dissension
destroy
a
family
and
prevent
its
progress
so
nations
are
destroyed
and
advancement
hindered
all
the
heavenly
books
divine
prophets
sages
and
philosophers
agree
that
warfare
is
destructive
to
human
development
and
peace
constructive
they
agree
that
war
and
strife
strike
at
the
foundations
of
humanity
therefore
a
power
is
needed
to
prevent
war
and
to
proclaim
and
establish
the
oneness
of
humanity
but
knowledge
of
the
need
of
this
power
is
not
sufficient
realizing
that
wealth
is
desirable
is
not
becoming
wealthy
the
admission
that
scientific
attainment
is
praiseworthy
does
not
confer
scientific
knowledge
acknowledgment
of
the
excellence
of
honor
does
not
make
a
man
honorable
knowledge
of
human
conditions
and
the
needed
remedy
for
them
is
not
the
cause
of
their
betterment
to
admit
that
health
is
good
does
not
constitute
health
a
skilled
physician
is
needed
to
remedy
existing
human
conditions
as
a
physician
is
required
to
have
complete
knowledge
of
pathology
diagnosis
therapeutics
and
treatment
so
this
world
physician
must
be
wise
skillful
and
capable
before
health
will
result
his
mere
knowledge
is
not
health
it
must
be
applied
and
the
remedy
carried
out
the
attainment
of
any
object
is
conditioned
upon
knowledge
volition
and
action
unless
these
three
conditions
are
forthcoming
there
is
no
execution
or
accomplishment
in
the
erection
of
a
house
it
is
first
necessary
to
know
the
ground
and
design
the
house
suitable
for
it
second
to
obtain
the
means
or
funds
necessary
for
the
construction
third
to
actually
build
it
therefore
a
power
is
needed
to
carry
out
and
execute
what
is
known
and
admitted
to
be
the
remedy
for
human
conditions
namely
the
unification
of
mankind
furthermore
it
is
evident
that
this
cannot
be
realized
through
material
process
and
means
the
accomplishment
of
this
unification
cannot
be
through
racial
power
for
races
are
different
and
diverse
in
tendencies
it
cannot
be
through
patriotic
power
for
nationalities
are
unlike
nor
can
it
be
effected
through
political
power
since
the
policies
of
governments
and
nations
are
various
that
is
to
say
any
effort
toward
unification
through
these
material
means
would
benefit
one
and
injure
another
because
of
unequal
and
individual
interests
some
may
believe
this
great
remedy
can
be
found
in
dogmatic
insistence
upon
imitations
and
interpretations
this
would
likewise
be
without
foundation
and
result
therefore
it
is
evident
that
no
means
but
an
ideal
means
a
spiritual
power
divine
bestowals
and
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
will
heal
this
world
sickness
of
war
dissension
and
discord
nothing
else
is
possible
nothing
can
be
conceived
of
but
through
spiritual
means
and
the
divine
power
it
is
possible
and
practicable
consider
history
what
has
brought
unity
to
nations
morality
to
peoples
and
benefits
to
mankind
if
we
reflect
upon
it
we
will
find
that
establishing
the
divine
religions
has
been
the
greatest
means
toward
accomplishing
the
oneness
of
humanity
the
foundation
of
divine
reality
in
religion
has
done
this
not
imitations
of
ancestral
religious
forms
imitations
are
opposed
to
each
other
and
have
ever
been
the
cause
of
strife
enmity
jealousy
and
war
the
divine
religions
are
collective
centers
in
which
diverse
standpoints
may
meet
agree
and
unify
they
accomplish
oneness
of
nativities
races
and
policies
for
instance
his
holiness
christ
united
various
nations
brought
peace
to
warring
peoples
and
established
the
oneness
of
human
kind
the
conquering
greeks
and
romans
the
prejudiced
egyptians
and
assyrians
were
all
in
a
condition
of
strife
enmity
and
war
but
his
holiness
gathered
these
varied
peoples
together
and
removed
the
foundations
of
discord
not
through
racial
patriotic
or
political
power
but
through
divine
power
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
this
was
not
otherwise
possible
all
other
efforts
of
men
and
nations
remain
as
mere
mention
in
history
without
accomplishment
as
this
great
result
is
contingent
upon
divine
power
and
bestowals
where
shall
the
world
obtain
that
power
god
is
eternal
and
ancient
not
a
new
god
his
sovereignty
is
of
old
not
recent
not
merely
existent
these
five
or
six
thousand
years
this
infinite
universe
is
from
everlasting
the
sovereignty
power
names
and
attributes
of
god
are
eternal
ancient
his
names
presuppose
creation
and
predicate
his
existence
and
will
we
say
god
is
creator
this
name
creator
appears
when
we
connote
creation
we
say
god
is
the
provider
this
name
presupposes
and
proves
the
existence
of
the
provided
god
is
love
this
name
proves
the
existence
of
the
beloved
in
the
same
way
god
is
mercy
god
is
justice
god
is
life
etc
etc
therefore
as
god
is
creator
eternal
and
ancient
there
were
always
creatures
and
subjects
existing
and
provided
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
divine
sovereignty
is
eternal
sovereignty
necessitates
subjects
ministers
trustees
and
others
subordinate
to
sovereignty
could
there
be
a
king
without
country
subjects
and
armies
if
we
conceive
of
a
time
when
there
were
no
creatures
no
servants
no
subjects
of
divine
lordship
we
dethrone
god
and
predicate
a
time
when
god
was
not
it
would
be
as
if
he
had
been
recently
appointed
and
man
had
given
these
names
to
him
the
divine
sovereignty
is
ancient
eternal
god
from
everlasting
was
love
justice
power
creator
provider
the
omniscient
the
bountiful
as
the
divine
entity
is
eternal
the
divine
attributes
are
coexistent
coeternal
the
divine
bestowals
are
therefore
without
beginning
without
end
god
is
infinite
the
works
of
god
are
infinite
the
bestowals
of
god
are
infinite
as
his
divinity
is
eternal
his
lordship
and
perfections
are
without
end
as
the
bounty
of
the
holy
spirit
is
eternal
we
can
never
say
that
his
bestowals
terminate
else
he
terminates
if
we
think
of
the
sun
and
then
try
to
conceive
of
the
cessation
of
the
solar
flame
and
heat
we
have
predicated
the
nonexistence
of
the
sun
for
separation
of
the
sun
from
its
rays
and
heat
is
inconceivable
therefore
if
we
limit
the
bestowals
of
god
we
limit
the
attributes
of
god
and
limit
god
let
us
then
trust
in
the
bounty
and
bestowal
of
god
let
us
be
exhilarated
with
the
divine
breath
illumined
and
exalted
by
the
heavenly
gladtidings
god
has
ever
dealt
with
man
in
mercy
and
kindness
he
who
conferred
the
divine
spirit
in
former
times
is
abundantly
able
and
capable
at
all
times
and
periods
to
grant
the
same
bestowals
therefore
let
us
be
hopeful
the
god
who
gave
to
the
world
formerly
will
do
so
now
and
in
the
future
god
who
breathed
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
upon
his
servants
will
breathe
it
upon
them
now
and
hereafter
there
is
no
cessation
to
his
bounty
the
divine
spirit
is
penetrating
from
eternity
to
eternity
for
it
is
the
bounty
of
god
and
the
bounty
of
god
is
eternal
can
you
conceive
of
limitation
of
the
divine
power
in
atomic
verities
or
cessation
of
the
divine
bounty
in
existing
organisms
could
you
conceive
the
power
now
manifest
in
this
glass
in
cohesion
of
its
atoms
becoming
nonexistent
the
energy
by
which
the
water
of
the
sea
is
constituted
failing
to
exert
itself
and
the
sea
disappearing
a
shower
of
rain
today
and
no
more
showers
afterward
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
terminated
and
no
more
light
or
heat
when
we
observe
that
in
the
kingdom
of
minerals
the
divine
bounties
are
continuous
how
much
more
shall
we
expect
and
realize
in
the
divine
spiritual
kingdom
how
much
greater
the
radiation
of
the
lights
of
god
and
the
bounty
of
life
everlasting
upon
the
soul
of
man
as
the
body
of
the
universe
is
continuous
indestructible
the
bounties
and
bestowals
of
the
divine
spirit
are
everlasting
i
praise
god
that
i
am
privileged
to
be
present
in
this
revered
assembly
which
is
quickened
with
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
heavenly
attraction
its
members
investigating
the
reality
their
utmost
hope
the
establishment
of
international
peace
and
their
greatest
purpose
service
to
the
world
of
humanity
when
we
observe
the
world
of
created
phenomena
we
discover
that
each
atom
of
the
atoms
of
substance
is
moving
through
the
various
degrees
and
kingdoms
of
organic
life
for
instance
consider
the
ethereal
element
which
is
penetrating
and
traveling
through
all
the
contingent
realities
when
there
is
vibration
or
movement
in
the
ethereal
element
the
eye
is
affected
by
that
vibration
and
beholds
what
is
known
as
light
in
the
same
manner
the
bestowals
of
god
are
moving
and
circulating
throughout
all
created
things
this
illimitable
divine
bounty
has
no
beginning
and
will
have
no
ending
it
is
moving
circulating
and
becomes
effective
wherever
capacity
is
developed
to
receive
it
in
every
station
there
is
a
specialized
capacity
therefore
we
must
be
hopeful
that
through
the
bounty
and
favor
of
god
this
spirit
of
life
infusing
all
created
things
shall
quicken
humanity
and
from
its
bestowals
the
human
world
become
a
divine
world
this
earthly
kingdom
the
mirror
of
the
realm
of
divinity
the
virtues
and
perfections
of
the
world
of
humanity
become
unveiled
and
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
be
reflected
from
this
temple
the
law
of
god
surely
for
everything
there
is
an
allcomprehending
wisdom
especially
for
the
great
and
important
affairs
of
life
the
supreme
and
most
important
happening
in
the
human
world
is
the
manifestation
of
god
and
the
descent
of
the
law
of
god
the
holy
divine
manifestations
did
not
reveal
themselves
for
the
purpose
of
founding
a
nation
sect
or
faction
they
did
not
appear
in
order
that
a
certain
number
might
acknowledge
their
prophethood
they
did
not
declare
their
heavenly
mission
and
message
in
order
to
lay
the
foundation
for
a
religious
belief
even
his
holiness
christ
did
not
become
manifest
that
we
should
merely
believe
in
him
as
the
christ
follow
him
and
adore
his
mention
all
these
are
limited
in
scope
and
requirement
whereas
the
reality
of
christ
is
an
unlimited
essence
the
infinite
and
unlimited
reality
cannot
be
bounded
by
any
limitation
nay
rather
his
holiness
christ
appeared
in
order
to
illumine
the
world
of
humanity
to
render
the
earthly
world
celestial
to
make
the
human
kingdom
a
realm
of
angels
to
unite
the
hearts
to
enkindle
the
light
of
love
in
human
souls
so
that
such
souls
might
become
independent
attaining
complete
unity
and
fellowship
turning
to
god
entering
into
the
divine
kingdom
receiving
the
bounties
and
bestowals
of
god
and
partaking
of
the
manna
from
heaven
through
christ
they
were
intended
to
be
baptized
by
the
holy
spirit
attain
a
new
spirit
and
realize
the
life
everlasting
all
the
holy
precepts
and
the
announcements
of
prophetic
laws
were
for
these
various
and
heavenly
purposes
therefore
we
offer
thanks
to
god
that
although
no
earthly
relation
obtains
among
us
yetpraise
be
to
godideal
and
divine
bonds
blend
us
together
we
have
gathered
here
in
this
meeting
eagerly
anticipating
the
showing
forth
of
the
divine
bestowals
in
past
centuries
the
nations
of
the
world
have
imagined
that
the
law
of
god
demanded
blind
imitation
of
ancestral
forms
of
belief
and
worship
for
example
the
jews
were
captives
of
hereditary
racial
religious
observances
the
mohammedans
likewise
have
been
held
in
the
bondage
of
traditionary
forms
and
ceremonials
the
christians
also
have
been
implicit
followers
of
ancient
tradition
and
hereditary
teaching
at
the
same
time
the
basic
foundation
of
the
religion
of
god
which
was
ever
the
principle
of
love
unity
and
the
fellowship
of
humanity
has
been
forsaken
and
cast
aside
each
religious
system
holding
tenaciously
to
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
as
the
supreme
essential
therefore
hatred
and
hostility
have
appeared
in
the
world
instead
of
the
divine
fruitage
of
unity
and
love
by
reason
of
this
it
has
been
impossible
for
the
followers
of
religion
to
meet
together
in
fellowship
and
agreement
even
contact
and
communication
have
been
considered
contaminating
and
the
outcome
has
been
a
condition
of
complete
alienation
and
mutual
bigotry
there
has
been
no
investigation
of
the
essential
underlying
basis
of
reality
one
whose
father
was
a
jew
invariably
proved
to
be
a
jew
a
mohammedan
was
born
of
a
mohammedan
a
buddhist
was
a
buddhist
because
of
the
faith
of
his
father
before
him
and
so
on
in
brief
religion
was
a
heritage
descending
from
father
to
son
ancestry
to
posterity
without
investigation
of
the
fundamental
reality
consequently
all
religionists
were
veiled
obscured
and
at
variance
praise
be
to
god
we
are
living
in
this
most
radiant
century
wherein
human
perceptions
have
developed
and
investigations
of
real
foundations
characterize
mankind
individually
and
collectively
man
is
proving
and
penetrating
into
the
reality
of
outer
and
inner
conditions
therefore
it
has
come
to
pass
that
we
are
renouncing
all
that
savors
of
blind
imitation
and
impartially
and
independently
investigating
truth
let
us
understand
what
constitutes
the
reality
of
the
divine
religions
if
a
christian
sets
aside
traditionary
forms
and
blind
imitation
of
ceremonials
and
investigates
the
reality
of
the
gospels
he
will
discover
that
the
foundation
principles
of
the
teachings
of
his
holiness
christ
were
mercy
love
fellowship
benevolence
altruism
the
resplendence
or
radiance
of
divine
bestowals
acquisition
of
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
oneness
with
god
furthermore
he
will
learn
that
his
holiness
declared
that
the
father
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good
and
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
the
meaning
of
this
declaration
is
that
the
mercy
of
god
encircles
all
mankind
that
not
a
single
individual
is
deprived
of
the
mercy
of
god
and
no
soul
is
denied
the
resplendent
bestowals
of
god
the
whole
human
race
is
submerged
in
the
sea
of
the
mercy
of
the
lord
and
we
are
all
the
sheep
of
the
one
divine
shepherd
whatever
shortcomings
exist
among
us
must
be
remedied
for
example
those
who
are
ignorant
must
be
educated
so
that
they
may
become
wise
the
sick
must
be
treated
until
they
recover
those
who
are
immature
must
be
trained
in
order
to
reach
maturity
those
asleep
must
be
awakened
all
this
must
be
accomplished
through
love
and
not
through
hatred
and
hostility
furthermore
his
holiness
jesus
christ
referring
to
the
prophecy
of
isaiah
spoke
of
those
who
having
eyes
see
not
having
ears
hear
not
having
hearts
understand
not
yet
they
were
to
be
healed
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
bounties
of
christ
transformed
the
eye
which
was
blind
into
a
seeing
one
rendered
the
ear
which
was
formerly
deaf
attentive
and
made
the
hard
callous
heart
tender
and
sensitive
in
other
words
the
meaning
is
that
although
the
people
possess
external
eyes
yet
the
insight
or
perception
of
the
soul
is
blind
although
the
outer
ear
hears
the
spiritual
hearing
is
deaf
although
they
possess
conscious
hearts
they
are
without
illumination
and
the
bounties
of
his
holiness
christ
save
souls
from
these
conditions
it
is
evident
then
that
the
manifestation
of
the
messiah
was
synonymous
with
universal
mercy
his
providence
was
universal
and
his
teachings
were
for
all
his
lights
were
not
restricted
to
a
few
every
christ
came
to
the
world
of
mankind
therefore
we
must
investigate
the
foundation
of
divine
religion
discover
its
reality
reestablish
it
and
spread
its
message
throughout
the
world
so
that
it
may
become
the
source
of
illumination
and
enlightenment
to
mankind
the
spiritually
dead
become
alive
the
spiritually
blind
receive
sight
and
those
who
are
inattentive
to
god
become
awakened
continuity
of
revelation
those
who
are
uninformed
of
the
world
of
reality
who
do
not
comprehend
existing
things
who
are
without
perception
of
the
inner
truth
of
creation
who
do
not
penetrate
the
real
mysteries
of
material
and
spiritual
phenomena
and
who
possess
only
a
superficial
idea
of
universal
life
and
being
are
but
embodiments
of
pure
ignorance
they
believe
only
that
which
they
have
heard
from
their
fathers
and
ancestors
of
themselves
they
have
no
hearing
no
sight
no
reason
no
intellect
they
rely
solely
upon
tradition
such
persons
imagine
that
the
dominion
of
god
is
an
accidental
dominion
or
kingdom
for
instance
they
believe
that
this
world
of
existence
was
created
six
or
seven
thousand
years
ago
as
if
god
did
not
reign
before
that
time
and
had
no
creation
before
that
period
they
think
that
divinity
is
accidental
for
to
them
divinity
is
dependent
upon
existing
things
whereas
in
reality
as
long
as
there
has
been
a
god
there
has
been
a
creation
as
long
as
there
has
been
light
there
have
been
recipients
of
that
light
for
light
cannot
become
manifest
unless
those
things
which
perceive
and
appreciate
it
exist
the
world
of
divinity
presupposes
creation
presupposes
recipients
of
bounty
presupposes
the
existence
of
worlds
no
divinity
can
be
conceived
as
separate
from
creation
for
otherwise
it
would
be
like
imagining
an
empire
without
a
people
a
king
must
needs
have
a
kingdom
must
needs
have
an
army
and
subjects
is
it
possible
to
be
a
king
and
have
no
country
no
army
no
subjects
this
is
an
absurdity
if
we
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
no
country
no
army
and
no
subjects
how
then
could
there
have
been
a
king
and
ruler
for
these
things
are
essential
to
a
king
consequently
just
as
the
reality
of
divinity
never
had
a
beginningthat
is
god
has
ever
been
a
creator
god
has
ever
been
a
provider
god
has
ever
been
a
quickener
god
has
ever
been
a
bestowerso
there
never
has
been
a
time
when
the
attributes
of
god
have
not
had
expression
the
sun
is
the
sun
because
of
its
rays
because
of
its
heat
were
we
to
conceive
of
a
time
when
there
was
a
sun
without
heat
and
light
it
would
imply
that
there
had
been
no
sun
at
all
and
that
it
became
the
sun
afterward
so
likewise
if
we
say
there
was
a
time
when
god
had
no
creation
or
created
beings
a
time
when
there
were
no
recipients
of
his
bounties
and
that
his
names
and
attributes
had
not
been
manifested
this
would
be
equivalent
to
a
complete
denial
of
divinity
for
it
would
mean
that
divinity
is
accidental
to
explain
it
still
more
clearly
if
we
think
that
fifty
thousand
years
ago
or
one
hundred
thousand
years
ago
there
was
no
creation
that
there
were
then
no
worlds
no
human
beings
no
animals
this
thought
of
ours
would
mean
that
previous
to
that
period
there
was
no
divinity
if
we
should
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
a
king
but
there
were
no
subjects
no
army
no
country
for
him
to
rule
over
it
would
really
be
asserting
that
there
was
a
time
when
no
king
existed
and
that
the
king
is
accidental
it
is
therefore
evident
that
inasmuch
as
the
reality
of
divinity
is
without
a
beginning
creation
is
also
without
a
beginning
this
is
as
clear
as
the
sun
when
we
contemplate
this
vast
machinery
of
omnipresent
power
perceive
this
illimitable
space
and
its
innumerable
worlds
it
will
become
evident
to
us
that
the
lifetime
of
this
infinite
creation
is
more
than
six
thousand
years
nay
it
is
very
very
ancient
notwithstanding
this
we
read
in
genesis
in
the
old
testament
that
the
lifetime
of
creation
is
but
six
thousand
years
this
has
an
inner
meaning
and
significance
it
is
not
to
be
taken
literally
for
instance
it
is
said
in
the
old
testament
that
certain
things
were
created
in
the
first
day
the
narrative
shows
that
at
that
time
the
sun
was
not
yet
created
how
could
we
conceive
of
a
day
if
no
sun
existed
in
the
heavens
for
the
day
depends
upon
the
light
of
the
sun
inasmuch
as
the
sun
had
not
been
made
how
could
the
first
day
be
realized
therefore
these
statements
have
significances
other
than
literal
to
be
brief
our
purpose
is
to
show
that
the
divine
sovereignty
the
kingdom
of
god
is
an
ancient
sovereignty
that
it
is
not
an
accidental
sovereignty
just
as
a
kingdom
presupposes
the
existence
of
subjects
of
an
army
of
a
country
for
otherwise
the
state
of
dominion
authority
and
kingdom
cannot
be
conceived
of
therefore
if
we
should
imagine
that
the
creation
is
accidental
we
would
be
forced
to
admit
that
the
creator
is
accidental
whereas
the
divine
bounty
is
ever
flowing
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
truth
are
continuously
shining
no
cessation
is
possible
to
the
divine
bounty
just
as
no
cessation
is
possible
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
this
is
clear
and
obvious
thus
there
have
been
many
holy
manifestations
of
god
one
thousand
years
ago
two
hundred
thousand
years
ago
one
million
years
ago
the
bounty
of
god
was
flowing
the
radiance
of
god
was
shining
the
dominion
of
god
was
existing
why
do
these
holy
manifestations
of
god
appear
what
is
the
wisdom
and
purpose
of
their
coming
what
is
the
outcome
of
their
mission
it
is
evident
that
human
personality
appears
in
two
aspectsthe
image
or
likeness
of
god
and
the
aspect
of
satan
the
human
reality
stands
between
these
twothe
divine
and
the
satanic
it
is
manifest
that
beyond
this
material
body
man
is
endowed
with
another
reality
which
is
the
world
of
exemplars
constituting
the
heavenly
body
of
man
in
speaking
man
says
i
saw
i
spoke
i
went
who
is
this
i
it
is
obvious
that
this
i
is
different
from
this
body
it
is
clear
that
when
man
is
thinking
it
is
as
though
he
were
consulting
with
some
other
person
with
whom
is
he
consulting
it
is
evident
that
it
is
another
reality
or
one
aside
from
this
body
with
whom
he
enters
into
consultation
when
he
thinks
shall
i
do
this
work
or
not
what
will
be
the
result
of
my
doing
this
or
when
he
questions
the
other
reality
what
is
the
objection
to
this
work
if
i
do
it
and
then
that
reality
in
man
communicates
its
opinion
to
him
concerning
the
point
at
issue
therefore
that
reality
in
man
is
clearly
and
obviously
other
than
his
body
an
ego
with
which
man
enters
into
consultation
and
whose
opinion
man
seeks
often
a
man
makes
up
his
mind
positively
about
a
matter
for
instance
he
determines
to
undertake
a
journey
then
he
thinks
it
over
that
is
he
consults
his
inner
reality
and
finally
concludes
that
he
will
give
up
his
journey
what
has
happened
why
did
he
abandon
his
original
purpose
it
is
evident
that
he
has
consulted
his
inner
reality
which
expresses
to
him
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
journey
therefore
he
defers
to
that
reality
and
changes
his
original
intention
furthermore
man
sees
in
the
world
of
dreams
he
travels
in
the
east
he
travels
in
the
west
although
his
body
is
stationary
his
body
is
here
it
is
that
reality
in
him
which
makes
the
journey
while
the
body
sleeps
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
reality
exists
other
than
the
outward
physical
reality
again
for
instance
a
person
is
dead
is
buried
in
the
ground
afterward
you
see
him
in
the
world
of
dreams
and
speak
with
him
although
his
body
is
interred
in
the
earth
who
is
the
person
you
see
in
your
dreams
talk
to
and
who
also
speaks
with
you
this
again
proves
that
there
is
another
reality
different
from
the
physical
one
which
dies
and
is
buried
thus
it
is
certain
that
in
man
there
is
a
reality
which
is
not
the
physical
body
sometimes
the
body
becomes
weak
but
that
other
reality
is
in
its
own
normal
state
the
body
goes
to
sleep
becomes
as
one
dead
but
that
reality
is
moving
about
comprehending
things
expressing
them
and
is
even
conscious
of
itself
this
other
and
inner
reality
is
called
the
heavenly
body
the
ethereal
form
which
corresponds
to
this
body
this
is
the
conscious
reality
which
discovers
the
inner
meaning
of
things
for
the
outer
body
of
man
does
not
discover
anything
the
inner
ethereal
reality
grasps
the
mysteries
of
existence
discovers
scientific
truths
and
indicates
their
technical
application
it
discovers
electricity
produces
the
telegraph
the
telephone
and
opens
the
door
to
the
world
of
arts
if
the
outer
material
body
did
this
the
animal
would
likewise
be
able
to
make
scientific
and
wonderful
discoveries
for
the
animal
shares
with
man
all
physical
powers
and
limitations
what
then
is
that
power
which
penetrates
the
realities
of
existence
and
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
animal
it
is
the
inner
reality
which
comprehends
things
throws
light
upon
the
mysteries
of
life
and
being
discovers
the
heavenly
kingdom
unseals
the
mysteries
of
god
and
differentiates
man
from
the
brute
of
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
we
have
before
indicated
this
human
reality
stands
between
the
higher
and
the
lower
in
man
between
the
world
of
the
animal
and
the
world
of
divinity
when
the
animal
proclivity
in
man
becomes
predominant
he
sinks
even
lower
than
the
brute
when
the
heavenly
powers
are
triumphant
in
his
nature
he
becomes
the
noblest
and
most
superior
being
in
the
world
of
creation
all
the
imperfections
found
in
the
animal
are
found
in
man
in
him
there
is
antagonism
hatred
and
selfish
struggle
for
existence
in
his
nature
lurk
jealousy
revenge
ferocity
cunning
hypocrisy
greed
injustice
and
tyranny
so
to
speak
the
reality
of
man
is
clad
in
the
outer
garment
of
the
animal
the
habiliments
of
the
world
of
nature
the
world
of
darkness
imperfections
and
unlimited
baseness
on
the
other
hand
we
find
in
him
justice
sincerity
faithfulness
knowledge
wisdom
illumination
mercy
and
pity
coupled
with
intellect
comprehension
the
power
to
grasp
the
realities
of
things
and
the
ability
to
penetrate
the
truths
of
existence
all
these
great
perfections
are
to
be
found
in
man
therefore
we
say
that
man
is
a
reality
which
stands
between
light
and
darkness
from
this
standpoint
of
view
his
nature
is
threefold
animal
human
and
divine
the
animal
nature
is
darkness
the
heavenly
is
light
in
light
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
come
into
the
world
to
dispel
the
darkness
of
the
animal
or
physical
nature
of
man
to
purify
him
from
his
imperfections
in
order
that
his
heavenly
and
spiritual
nature
may
become
quickened
his
divine
qualities
awakened
his
perfections
visible
his
potential
powers
revealed
and
all
the
virtues
of
the
world
of
humanity
latent
within
him
may
come
to
life
these
holy
manifestations
of
god
are
the
educators
and
trainers
of
the
world
of
existence
the
teachers
of
the
world
of
humanity
they
liberate
man
from
the
darkness
of
the
world
of
nature
deliver
him
from
despair
error
ignorance
imperfections
and
all
evil
qualities
they
clothe
him
in
the
garment
of
perfections
and
exalted
virtues
men
are
ignorant
the
manifestations
of
god
make
them
wise
they
are
animalistic
the
manifestations
make
them
human
they
are
savage
and
cruel
the
manifestations
lead
them
into
kingdoms
of
light
and
love
they
are
unjust
the
manifestations
cause
them
to
become
just
man
is
selfish
they
sever
him
from
self
and
desire
man
is
haughty
they
make
him
meek
humble
and
friendly
he
is
earthly
they
make
him
heavenly
men
are
material
the
manifestations
transform
them
into
semblance
divine
they
are
immature
children
the
manifestations
develop
them
into
maturity
man
is
poor
they
endow
him
with
wealth
man
is
base
treacherous
and
mean
the
manifestations
of
god
uplift
him
into
dignity
nobility
and
loftiness
these
holy
manifestations
liberate
the
world
of
humanity
from
the
imperfections
which
beset
it
and
cause
men
to
appear
in
the
beauty
of
heavenly
perfections
were
it
not
for
the
coming
of
these
holy
manifestations
of
god
all
mankind
would
be
found
on
the
plane
of
the
animal
they
would
remain
darkened
and
ignorant
like
those
who
have
been
denied
schooling
and
who
never
had
a
teacher
or
trainer
undoubtedly
such
unfortunates
will
continue
in
their
condition
of
need
and
deprivation
if
the
mountains
hills
and
plains
of
the
material
world
are
left
wild
and
uncultivated
under
the
rule
of
nature
they
will
remain
an
unbroken
wilderness
no
fruitful
tree
to
be
found
anywhere
upon
them
a
true
cultivator
changes
this
forest
and
jungle
into
a
garden
training
its
trees
to
bring
forth
fruit
and
causing
flowers
to
grow
in
place
of
thorns
and
thistles
the
holy
manifestations
are
the
ideal
gardeners
of
human
souls
the
divine
cultivators
of
human
hearts
the
world
of
existence
is
but
a
jungle
of
disorder
and
confusion
a
state
of
nature
producing
nothing
but
fruitless
useless
trees
the
ideal
gardeners
train
these
wild
uncultivated
human
trees
cause
them
to
become
fruitful
water
and
cultivate
them
day
by
day
so
that
they
adorn
the
world
of
existence
and
continue
to
flourish
in
the
utmost
beauty
consequently
we
cannot
say
that
the
divine
bounty
has
ceased
that
the
glory
of
divinity
is
exhausted
or
the
sun
of
truth
sunk
into
eternal
sunset
into
that
darkness
which
is
not
followed
by
light
into
that
night
which
is
not
followed
by
a
sunrise
and
dawn
into
that
death
which
is
not
followed
by
life
into
that
error
which
is
not
followed
by
truth
is
it
conceivable
that
the
sun
of
reality
should
sink
into
an
eternal
darkness
no
the
sun
was
created
in
order
that
it
may
shed
light
upon
the
world
and
train
all
the
kingdoms
of
existence
how
then
can
the
ideal
sun
of
truth
the
word
of
god
set
forever
for
this
would
mean
the
cessation
of
the
divine
bounty
and
the
divine
bounty
by
its
very
nature
is
continuous
and
ceaseless
its
sun
is
ever
shining
its
cloud
is
ever
producing
rain
its
breezes
are
ever
blowing
its
bestowals
are
allcomprehending
its
gifts
are
ever
perfect
consequently
we
must
always
anticipate
always
be
hopeful
and
pray
to
god
that
he
will
send
unto
us
his
holy
manifestations
in
their
most
perfect
might
with
the
divine
penetrative
power
of
his
word
so
that
these
heavenly
ones
may
be
distinguished
above
all
other
beings
in
every
respect
in
every
attribute
just
as
the
glorious
sun
is
distinguished
above
all
stars
although
the
stars
are
scintillating
and
brilliant
the
sun
is
superior
to
them
in
luminous
effulgence
similarly
these
holy
divine
manifestations
are
and
must
always
be
distinguished
above
all
other
beings
in
every
attribute
of
glory
and
perfection
in
order
that
it
may
be
proven
that
the
manifestation
is
the
true
teacher
and
real
trainer
that
he
is
the
sun
of
truth
endowed
with
a
supreme
splendor
and
reflecting
the
beauty
of
god
otherwise
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
train
one
human
individual
and
then
after
training
him
believe
in
him
and
accept
him
as
the
holy
manifestation
of
divinity
the
real
manifestation
of
god
must
be
endowed
with
divine
knowledge
and
not
dependent
upon
learning
acquired
in
schools
he
must
be
the
educator
not
the
educated
his
standard
intuition
instead
of
tuition
he
must
be
perfect
and
not
imperfect
great
and
glorious
instead
of
being
weak
and
impotent
he
must
be
wealthy
in
the
riches
of
the
spiritual
world
and
not
indigent
in
a
word
the
holy
divine
manifestation
of
god
must
be
distinguished
above
all
others
of
mankind
in
every
aspect
and
qualification
in
order
that
he
may
be
able
to
effectively
train
the
human
body
politic
eliminate
the
darkness
enshrouding
the
human
world
uplift
humanity
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
kingdom
be
able
through
the
penetrative
power
of
his
word
to
promote
and
spread
broadcast
the
beneficent
message
of
universal
peace
among
men
bring
about
the
unification
of
mankind
in
religious
belief
through
a
manifest
divine
power
harmonize
all
sects
and
denominations
and
convert
all
nativities
and
nationalities
into
one
nativity
and
fatherland
it
is
our
hope
that
the
bounties
of
god
will
encompass
us
all
the
gifts
of
the
divine
become
manifest
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
truth
illumine
our
eyes
inspire
our
hearts
convey
to
our
souls
cheerful
gladtidings
of
god
cause
our
thoughts
to
become
lofty
and
our
efforts
to
be
productive
of
glorious
results
in
a
word
it
is
our
hope
that
we
may
attain
to
that
which
is
the
summit
of
human
aspirations
and
wishes

difference
between

from

it
is
permissible
to

such
sciences
as

from

the
individual
should
prior
to
engaging
in

of
any
subject
ask
from

written

the
choice
you
have
made
for
your
course

is
surely
most

certainly
not

in

in

you

on
the

whose

we
have

is
the
hope
of
the
house

that
a
study
of
this
compilation
will
serve
as
a
stimulus
and
a
guide
in
the
further
development
of
bahai
scholarship
and
that
the
unique
features
of
this
vital
aspect
of

will
be
clarified

perusal
of

contents
the

lines
set
out
in
this
compilation
animated
by
the
spirit
of
inquiry
into
the
limitless
meaning
of
the
divine
teachings
this
scholarly
endeavour
should
be
characterized
by
the
welcome
it
offers
to
all

wish
to
be
involved
in
it
each
in

encouragement
and
cooperation
among
its
participants
and
by
the
respect
accorded
to
distinguished
accomplishment
and
outstanding
achievement
the
spirit
and
approach
should
be
far
removed
from
the
arrogance
contention
and
exclusiveness
which
have
too
often
sullied
the
name
of

recently
it
is
stated
that
the

advises
you
not
to
attempt
to
define
too
narrowly
the
form
that
bahai
scholarship
should
take
or
the
approach
that
scholars
should
adopt
rather
should
you
strive
to
develop
within
your
association
respect
for
a
wide
range
of
approaches
and
endeavours
no
doubt
there
will
be
some
bahais
who
will
wish
to
work
in
isolation
while
others
will
desire
consultation
and
collaboration
with
those
having
similar
interests
your
aim
should
be
to
promote
an
atmosphere
of
mutual
respect
and
tolerance
within
which
will
be
included
scholars
whose
principal
interest
is
in
theological
issues
as
well
as
those
scholars
whose
interests
lie
in
relating
the
insights
provided
by
the
bahai
teachings
to
contemporary
thought
in
the
arts
and
sciences
a
similar
diversity
should
characterize
the
endeavours
pursued
by
bahai
scholars
accommodating
their
interests
and
skills
as
well
as
the
needs
of
the
faith
the
course
of
world
events
the
development
of
new
trends
of
thought
and
the
extension
of
the
teaching
work
all
tend
to
highlight
attractive
and
beneficial
areas
to
which
bahai
scholars
might
well
direct
their
attention
likewise
the
expansion
of
the
activities
of
the
bahai
international
community
in
its
relationship
with
united
nations
agencies
and
other
international
bodies
creates
attractive
opportunities
for
scholars
to
make
a
direct
and
highly
valued
contribution
to
the
enhancement
of
the
prestige
of
the
faith
and
to
its
proclamation
within
an
influential
and
receptive
stratum
of
society
as
the
bahai
community
continues
to
emerge
inexorably
from
obscurity
it
will
be
confronted
by
enemies
from
both
within
and
without
whose
aim
will
be
to
malign
and
misrepresent
its
principles
so
that
its
admirers
might
be
disillusioned
and
the
faith
of
its
adherents
might
be
shaken
bahai
scholars
have
a
vital
role
to
play
in
the
defence
of
the
faith
through
their
contribution
to
anticipatory
measures
and
their
response
to
defamatory
accusations
levelled
against
the
faith
thus
there
should
be
room
within
the
scope
of
bahai
scholarship
to
accommodate
not
only
those
who
are
interested
in
theological
issues
and
in
the
historical
origins
of
the
faith
but
also
those
who
are
interested
in
relating
the
bahai
teachings
to
their
field
of
academic
or
professional
interest
as
well
as
those
believers
who
may
lack
formal
academic
qualifications
but
who
have
through
their
perceptive
study
of
the
teachings
acquired
insights
which
are
of
interest
to
others
the
house
of
justice
wishes
to
avoid
use
of
the
terms
bahai
scholarship
and
bahai
scholars
in
an
exclusive
sense
which
would
effectively
establish
a
demarcation
between
those
admitted
into
this
category
and
those
denied
entrance
to
it
it
is
clear
that
such
terms
are
relative
and
that
what
is
a
worthy
scholarly
endeavour
by
a
bahai
when
compared
to
the
activities
of
those
with
whom
he
is
in
contact
may
well
be
regarded
as
of
vastly
lesser

naturally

many
new
concepts
they
must
be
assisted
to
acquire
as
quickly
as
possible

this

shed
new

need
to
develop
greater
tolerance
toward
ideas
that
may
not
coincide
with
their
current
understanding

remain
open
to
new
insights
newly
enrolled
professionals
and
other
experts
provide
a
great
resource
for
the
development
of
bahai
scholarship
it
is
hoped
that
as
they
attain
a
deeper
grasp
of
the
teachings
and
their
significance
they
will
be
able
to
assist
bahai
communities

correlating
the
beliefs
of
the

the
current
thoughts
and
problems
of
the
world
in
some
instances
bahais
of
a
particular
profession
have
come
together
in
special
conferences
or
organized
themselves
into
an
association
for
this
purpose
this
also
allows
them
to
support
one
another
as
bahais
and
to
take
advantage
of
their
professional
status
to
promote
the
interests
of
the
faith
current
examples
of
professional
associations
of
this
type
are
the
bahai
justice
society
and
the
bahai
medical
association
both
in

special
encouragement
should
therefore
be
given

unusual
capacity
to
consecrate
their
abilities

the
house

suggests
that
the
issues
raised
in
your
letter
might
best
be
considered
in
light
of
the
statements
in
the
bahai
writings
which
disclose
the
relationship
between
the
revelation
of
bahaullah
and
the
knowledge
which
is
acquired
as
a
result
of
scholarly
endeavours
bahaullah
asserts
that
unveiled
and
unconcealed
this
wronged
one
hath
at
all
times
proclaimed
before
the
face
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
that
which
will
serve
as
the
key
for
unlocking
the
doors
of
sciences
of
arts
of
knowledge
of
wellbeing
of
prosperity
and
wealth
it
is
evident
that
the
bahai
writings
illuminate
all
areas
of
human
endeavour
and
all
academic
disciplines
those
who
have
been
privileged
to
recognize
the
station
of
bahaullah
have
the
bounty
of
access
to
a
revelation
which
casts
light
upon
all
aspects
of
thought
and
inquiry
and
are
enjoined
to
use
the
understanding
which
they
obtain
from
their
immersion
in
the
holy
writings
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
faith
those
believers
with
the
capacity
and
opportunity
to
do
so
have
repeatedly
been
encouraged
in
their
pursuit
of
academic
studies
by
which
they
are
not
only
equipped
to
render
much
needed
services
to
the
faith
but
are
also
provided
with
the
means
to
acquire
a
profound
insight
into
the
meaning
and
the
implications
of
the
bahai
teachings
they
discover
also
that
the
perceptions
gained
from
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
revelation
of
bahaullah
clarify
the
subjects
of
their
academic
inquiry
it
is
useful
to
review
a
number
of
statements
written
by
shoghi
effendi
on
this
subject

a
believer

had
completed
advanced
academic
studies

a
subject
related
to
the

stated

it

all
the
bahai
students

follow
the
noble
example
you
have
set
before
them

henceforth
be
led
to
investigate
and
analyse
the
principles
of
the
faith

to
correlate
them
with
the
modern
aspects
of
philosophy
and
science
every
intelligent
and
thoughtful
young
bahai
should
always
approach
the
cause
in
this
way

therein
lies
the
very
essence
of
the
principle

independent
investigation
of
truth

he
was
informed
of
the
enrolment
of
a
scientist
in
the

the
response
set
out
in

very

a
tremendous

his
secretary
wrote
on
another
occasion
that
shoghi

has
for
years
urged
the
bahais

asked
his
advice

in

also
to
study
history
economics

in
order
to
be
au

with
all
the
progressive
movements

thoughts
being
put
forth
today

so
that
they
could

these

the
simultaneous
endeavour

pursue
their
studies

to
delve
deeply

all

conclusions
are
to
be

they
are
urged
to
be
modest
about
their
accomplishments

to
bear
in
mind
always
the
statement

bahaullah
that
the
heart
must

therefore
be
cleansed
from
the
idle
sayings
of
men
and
sanctified
from
every
earthly
affection

written
on

to
an
individual
who
had
asked
a
question
about
the
skills
of
story
writing
and
whether
such
occupation
would
be
classed
as
those
sciences
that
begin
and
end
in
words
what
bahaullah
meant
primarily
with
sciences
that
begin
and
end
in
words
are
those
theological
treatises
and
commentaries
that
encumber
the
human
mind
rather
than
help
it
to
attain
the
truth
the
students
would
devote
their
life
to
their
study
but
still
attain
no
where
bahaullah
surely
never
meant
to
include
storywriting
under
such
a
category
and
shorthand
and
typewriting
are
both
most
useful
talents
very
necessary
in
our
present
social
and
economic
life
what
you
could
do
and
should
do
is
to
use
your
stories
to
become
a
source
of
inspiration
and
guidance
for
those
who
read
them
with
such
a
means
at
your
disposal
you
can
spread
the
spirit
and
teachings
of
the
cause
you
can
show
the
evils
that
exist
in
society
as
well
as
the
way
they
can
be
remedied
if
you
possess
a
real
talent
in
writing
you
should
consider
it
as
given
by
god
and
exert
your
efforts
to
use
it
for
the
betterment
of
society
the

that
you
will
be
able

there
are
only
four
accepted
methods
of
comprehensionthat
is
to
say
there
are
only
four
accepted
methods
of
comprehensionthat
is
to
say
the
realities
of
things
are
understood
by
these
four
methods
the
first
method
is
by
the
sensesthat
is
to
say
all
that
the
eye
the
ear
the
taste
the
smell
the
touch
perceive
is
understood
by
this
method
today
this
method
is
considered
the
most
perfect
by
all
the
european
philosophers
they
say
that
the
principal
method
of
gaining
knowledge
is
through
the
senses
they
consider
it
supreme
although
it
is
imperfect
for
it
commits
errors
for
example
the
greatest
of
the
senses
is
the
power
of
sight
the
sight
believes
the
earth
to
be
motionless
and
sees
the
sun
in
motion
and
in
many
similar
cases
it
makes
mistakes
therefore
we
cannot
trust
it
the
second
is
the
method
of
reason
which
was
that
of
the
ancient
philosophers
the
pillars
of
wisdom
this
is
the
method
of
the
understanding
they
proved
things
by
reason
and
hold
firmly
to
logical
proofs
all
their
arguments
are
arguments
of
reason
notwithstanding
this
they
differed
greatly
and
their
opinions
were
contradictory
they
even
changed
their
viewsthat
is
to
say
during
twenty
years
they
would
prove
the
existence
of
a
thing
by
logical
arguments
and
afterward
they
would
deny
it
by
logical
argumentsso
much
so
that
plato
at
first
logically
proved
the
immobility
of
the
earth
and
the
movement
of
the
sun
later
by
logical
arguments
he
proved
that
the
sun
was
the
stationary
center
and
that
the
earth
was
moving
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
method
of
reason
is
not
perfect
for
the
differences
of
the
ancient
philosophers
the
want
of
stability
and
the
variations
of
their
opinions
prove
this
for
if
it
were
perfect
all
ought
to
be
united
in
their
ideas
and
agreed
in
their
opinions
the
third
method
of
understanding
is
by
traditionthat
is
through
the
text
of
the
holy
scripturesfor
people
say
in
the
old
and
new
testaments
god
spoke
thus
this
method
equally
is
not
perfect
because
the
traditions
are
understood
by
the
reason
as
the
reason
itself
is
liable
to
err
how
can
it
be
said
that
in
interpreting
the
meaning
of
the
traditions
it
will
not
err
for
it
is
possible
for
it
to
make
mistakes
and
certainty
cannot
be
attained
this
is
the
method
of
the
religious
leaders
whatever
they
understand
and
comprehend
from
the
text
of
the
books
is
that
which
their
reason
understands
from
the
text
and
not
necessarily
the
real
truth
for
the
reason
is
like
a
balance
and
the
meanings
contained
in
the
text
of
the
holy
books
are
like
the
thing
which
is
weighed
if
the
balance
is
untrue
how
can
the
weight
be
ascertained
know
then
that
which
is
in
the
hands
of
people
that
which
they
believe
is
liable
to
error
for
in
proving
or
disproving
a
thing
if
a
proof
is
brought
forward
which
is
taken
from
the
evidence
of
our
senses
this
method
as
has
become
evident
is
not
perfect
if
the
proofs
are
intellectual
the
same
is
true
or
if
they
are
traditional
such
proofs
also
are
not
perfect
therefore
there
is
no
standard
in
the
hands
of
people
upon
which
we
can
rely
but
the
bounty
of
the
holy
spirit
gives
the
true
method
of
comprehension
which
is
infallible
and
indubitable
this
is
through
the
help
of
the
holy
spirit
which
comes
to
man
and
this
is
the
condition
in
which
certainty
can
alone
be
attained
some
answered
questions
pp
from

on

house

concern
was

many
of
the
friends

that

the
concern
was

friends
holding
that
there
is
only
one
correct
view

history

faith

critically
to
unfamiliar
views
this
has
already
been
covered
in
statements
made
by
the
universal
house
of
justice
itself
for
example
that
on
pages
of
wellspring
of
guidance
as
you
point
out
in
your
letter
divine
revelation
is
infallible
and
proceeds
from
an
allencompassing
knowledge
of
the
truth
but
when
individual
bahais
attempt
to
apply
sacred
texts
to
any
specific
problem
or
situation
they
do
so
using
their
own
minds
which
are
of
limited
understanding
thus
just
as
people
can
differ
from
one
another
in
their
use
of
reason
in
making
deductions
from
available
evidence
so
they
can
also
differ
in
their
understanding
and
application
of
a
passage
of
divine
revelation
the
bahai
principle
of
the
harmony
between
science
and
religion
requires
as
you
say
that
a
bahai
scholar
must
use
his
intelligence
to
arrive
at
a
solution
of
a
specific
problem
if
there
is
an
apparent
conflict
between
a
sacred
text
and
other
evidence
and
also
he
must
accept
the
fact
that
some
problems
may
defy
his
comprehension
by
conveying
the
comments
of
the
research

not

may
also
be
accidentally
erroneous
or
even
intentionally
fabricated
the
house
of
justice
realizes
that
you
are
fully
aware
of
this
but
it
stresses
the
point
because
it
does
not
see
how
a
bahai
historian
can
in
all
honesty
claim
to
be
a
faithful
believer
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
challenge
in
his
writings
the
veracity
and
honour
of
the
central
figures
of
the
faith
or
of
its
guardian
the
fact
that
the
faith
as
the
guardian
states
enjoins
upon
its
followers
the
primary
duty
of
an
unfettered
search
after
truth
should
reassure
any
aspiring
bahai
historian
that
there
can
be
no
question
of
any
requirement
to
distort
history
in
the
socalled
interests
of
the
faith
on
the
contrary
the
combination
of
profound
faith
and
freedom
of
thought
is
one
of
the
great
strengths
of
the
bahai
religion
it
does
however
place
a
great
responsibility
upon
bahai
historians
to
put
forward
their
views
and
conclusions
with
moderation
and
due
humility
in
this
connection
one
of
the
tablets
of
bahaullah
states
thou
hast
written
that
one
of
the
friends
hath
composed
a
treatise
this
was
mentioned
in
the
holy
presence
and
this
is
what
was
revealed
in
response
great
care
should
be
exercised
that
whatever
is
written
in
these
days
doth
not
cause
dissension
and
invite
the
objection
of
the
people
whatever
the
friends
of
the
one
true
god
say
in
these
days
is
listened
to
by
the
people
of
the
world
it
hath
been
revealed
in
the
lawhihikmat
the
unbelievers
have
inclined
their
ears
towards
us
in
order
to
hear
that
which
might
enable
them
to
cavil
against
god
the
help
in
peril
the
selfsubsisting
whatever
is
written
should
not
transgress
the
bounds
of
tact
and
wisdom
and
in
the
words
used
there
should
lie
hid
the
property
of
milk
so
that
the
children
of
the
world
may
be
nurtured
therewith
and
attain
maturity
we
have
said
in
the
past
that
one
word
hath
the
influence
of
spring
and
causeth
hearts
to
become
fresh
and
verdant
while
another
is
like
unto
blight
which
causeth
the
blossoms
and
flowers
to
wither
god
grant
that
authors
among
the
friends
will
write
in
such
a
way
as
would
be
acceptable
july
to
an
individual
believer
the
house
of
justice
had
hoped
that
the
publication
of
the
statement
the
house
of
justice
had
hoped
that
the
publication
of
the
statement
would
stimulate
discussion
among
bahai
scholars
and
encourage
them
to
examine
more
profoundly
all
aspects
of
their
work
and
the
effect
it
has
upon
both
bahai
and
nonbahai
audiences
the
aim
was
not
to
instruct
scholars
to
abandon
any
specific
methodology
but
to
warn
them
of
the
dangers
of
taking
for
granted
the
a
priori
assumptions
of
modern
nonbahai
scholars
and
of
allowing
their
thinking
and
their
understanding
of
the
faith
to
be
limited
by
criteria
which
they
themselves
as
bahais
would
know
to
be
in
error
it
was
also
the
hope
of
the
house
of
justice
that
bahai
scholars
would
realize
the
significance
of
the
manner
in
which
they
express
themselves
and
that
they
would
guard
against
use
of
the
proud
and
scornful
language
with
which
some
had
been
publicly
referring
to
their
fellow
believers
who
nevertheless
were
devotedly
trying
to
serve
the
faith
of
god
october

the
house
of

understands
that
you
desire
to
find
ways
of
conveying
spiritual
truths
in
logical
ways
and
demonstrating
their
validity
through
scientific
proofs
there
can
be
no
objection
to
such
an
attitude
abdulbaha
himself
used
such
a
method
the
danger
bahai
scholars
must
avoid
is
the
distortion
of
religious
truth
almost
forcibly
at
times
to
make
it
conform
to
understandings
and
perceptions
current
in
the
scientific
world
true
bahai
scholars
should
guard
against
this
in
a
letter
to
a
national
spiritual
assembly
dated
july
the
house
of
justice
wrote
while
it
may
often
be
the
part
of
wisdom
to
approach
individuals
or
an
audience
from
a
standpoint
of
current
knowledge
it
should
never
be
overlooked
that
the
revelation
of
the
manifestation
of
god
is
the
standard
for
all
knowledge
and
scientific
statements
and
theories
no
matter
how
close
they
may
come
to
the
eternal
principles
proclaimed
by
gods
messenger
are
in
their
very
nature
ephemeral
and
limited
likewise
attempting
to
make
the
bahai
faith
relevant
to
modern
society
is
to
incur
the
grave
risk
of
compromising
the
fundamental
verities
of
our
faith
in
an
effort
to
make
it
conform
to
current
theories
and
practices
june

the

of

is
over
a
methodological
the
principal
concern
of
the
house
of
justice
is
over
a
methodological
bias
and
discordant
tone
which
seem
to
inform
the
work
of
certain
of
the
authors
the
impression
given
is
that
in
attempting
to
achieve
what
they
understand
to
be
academic
objectivity
they
have
inadvertently
cast
the
faith
into
a
mould
which
is
essentially
foreign
to
its
nature
taking
no
account
of
the
spiritual
forces
which
bahais
see
as
its
foundation
presumably
the
justification
offered
for
this
approach
would
be
that
most
scholars
of
comparative
religion
are
essentially
concerned
with
discernable
phenomena
observable
events
and
practical
affairs
and
are
used
to
treating
their
subject
from
a
western
if
not
a
christian
viewpoint
this
approach
although
understandable
is
quite
impossible
for
a
bahai
for
it
ignores
the
fact
that
our
worldview
includes
the
spiritual
dimension
as
an
indispensable
component
for
consistency
and
coherence
and
it
does
not
beseem
a
bahai
to
write
about
his
faith
as
if
he
looked
upon
it
from
the
norm
of
humanism
or
materialism
in
other
words
we
are
presented
in
such
articles
with
the
spectacle
of
bahais
trying
to
write
as
if
they
were
nonbahais
this
leads
to
these
authors
drawing
conclusions
and
making
implications
which
are
in
conflict
with
bahai
teachings
and
with
the
reality
of
the
faith
a
good
bahai
author
when
writing
for
such
a
publication
should
be
fully
capable
of
adopting
a
calmly
neutral
and
expository
tone
without
falling
into
the
trap
of
distorting
the
picture
by
adopting
what
is
in
essence
a
materialistic
and
localized
stance

notes

hooper
harris
how
are
you
welcome
welcome
after
arriving
today
although
weary
with
travel
i
had
the
utmost
longing
and
yearning
to
see
you
and
could
not
resist
this
meeting
now
that
i
have
met
you
all
my
weariness
has
vanished
for
your
meeting
is
the
cause
of
spiritual
happiness
i
was
in
egypt
and
was
not
feeling
well
but
i
wished
to
come
to
you
in
america
my
friends
said
this
is
a
long
journey
the
sea
is
wide
you
should
remain
here
but
the
more
they
advised
and
insisted
the
greater
became
my
longing
to
take
this
trip
and
now
i
have
come
to
america
to
meet
the
friends
of
god
this
long
voyage
will
prove
how
great
is
my
love
for
you
there
were
many
troubles
and
vicissitudes
but
in
the
thought
of
meeting
you
all
these
things
vanished
and
were
forgotten
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
the
city
of
new
york
its
harbor
entrance
its
piers
buildings
and
broad
avenues
are
magnificent
and
beautiful
truly
it
is
a
wonderful
city
as
new
york
has
made
such
progress
in
material
civilization
i
hope
that
it
may
also
advance
spiritually
in
the
kingdom
and
covenant
of
god
so
that
the
friends
here
may
become
the
cause
of
the
illumination
of
america
that
this
city
may
become
the
city
of
love
and
that
the
fragrances
of
god
may
be
spread
from
this
place
to
all
parts
of
the
world
i
have
come
for
this
i
pray
that
you
may
be
manifestations
of
the
love
of
bahaullah
that
each
one
of
you
may
become
like
a
clear
lamp
of
crystal
from
which
the
rays
of
the
bounties
of
the
blessed
perfection
may
shine
forth
to
all
nations
and
peoples
this
is
my
highest
aspiration
it
was
a
long
long
trip
the
more
we
traveled
the
greater
seemed
the
expanse
of
the
sea
the
weather
was
brilliant
and
fine
throughout
there
was
no
storm
and
no
end
to
the
sea
i
am
very
happy
to
meet
you
all
here
today
praise
be
to
god
that
your
faces
are
shining
with
the
love
of
bahaullah
to
behold
them
is
the
cause
of
great
spiritual
happiness
we
have
arranged
to
meet
you
every
day
at
the
homes
of
the
friends
in
the
east
people
were
asking
me
why
do
you
undertake
this
long
voyage
your
body
cannot
endure
such
hardships
of
travel
when
it
is
necessary
my
body
can
endure
everything
it
has
withstood
forty
years
of
imprisonment
and
can
still
undergo
the
utmost
trials
i
will
see
you
again
now
i
will
greet
each
one
of
you
personally
it
is
my
hope
that
you
will
all
be
happy
and
that
we
may
meet
again
and
again

notes
by
howard
macnutt
this
is
a
most
happy
visit
i
have
crossed
the
sea
from
the
land
of
the
orient
for
the
joy
of
meeting
the
friends
of
god
although
i
am
weary
after
my
long
journey
the
light
of
the
spirit
shining
in
your
faces
brings
me
rest
and
reward
in
this
meeting
the
divine
susceptibilities
are
radiant
this
is
a
spiritual
house
the
home
of
the
spirit
there
is
no
discord
here
all
is
love
and
unity
when
souls
are
gathered
together
in
this
way
the
divine
bestowals
descend
the
purpose
of
the
creation
of
man
is
the
attainment
of
the
supreme
virtues
of
humanity
through
descent
of
the
heavenly
bestowals
the
purpose
of
mans
creation
is
therefore
unity
and
harmony
not
discord
and
separateness
if
the
atoms
which
compose
the
kingdom
of
the
minerals
were
without
affinity
for
each
other
the
earth
would
never
have
been
formed
the
universe
could
not
have
been
created
because
they
have
affinity
for
each
other
the
power
of
life
is
able
to
manifest
itself
and
the
organisms
of
the
phenomenal
world
become
possible
when
this
attraction
or
atomic
affinity
is
destroyed
the
power
of
life
ceases
to
manifest
death
and
nonexistence
result
it
is
so
likewise
in
the
spiritual
world
that
world
is
the
kingdom
of
complete
attraction
and
affinity
it
is
the
kingdom
of
the
one
divine
spirit
the
kingdom
of
god
therefore
the
affinity
and
love
manifest
in
this
meeting
the
divine
susceptibilities
witnessed
here
are
not
of
this
world
but
of
the
world
of
the
kingdom
when
the
souls
become
separated
and
selfish
the
divine
bounties
do
not
descend
and
the
lights
of
the
supreme
concourse
are
no
longer
reflected
even
though
the
bodies
meet
together
a
mirror
with
its
back
turned
to
the
sun
has
no
power
to
reflect
the
suns
effulgence
praise
be
to
god
the
purpose
of
this
assembly
is
love
and
unity
the
divine
prophets
came
to
establish
the
unity
of
the
kingdom
in
human
hearts
all
of
them
proclaimed
the
glad
tidings
of
the
divine
bestowals
to
the
world
of
mankind
all
brought
the
same
message
of
divine
love
to
the
world
jesus
christ
gave
his
life
upon
the
cross
for
the
unity
of
mankind
those
who
believed
in
him
likewise
sacrificed
life
honor
possessions
family
everything
that
this
human
world
might
be
released
from
the
hell
of
discord
enmity
and
strife
his
foundation
was
the
oneness
of
humanity
only
a
few
were
attracted
to
him
they
were
not
the
kings
and
rulers
of
his
time
they
were
not
rich
and
important
people
some
of
them
were
catchers
of
fish
most
of
them
were
ignorant
men
not
trained
in
the
knowledge
of
this
world
one
of
the
greatest
of
them
peter
could
not
remember
the
days
of
the
week
all
of
them
were
men
of
the
least
consequence
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
their
hearts
were
pure
and
attracted
by
the
fires
of
the
divine
spirit
manifested
in
christ
with
this
small
army
christ
conquered
the
world
of
the
east
and
the
west
kings
and
nations
rose
against
him
philosophers
and
the
greatest
men
of
learning
assailed
and
blasphemed
his
cause
all
were
defeated
and
overcome
their
tongues
silenced
their
lamps
extinguished
their
hatred
quenched
no
trace
of
them
now
remains
they
have
become
as
nonexistent
while
his
kingdom
is
triumphant
and
eternal
the
brilliant
star
of
his
cause
has
ascended
to
the
zenith
while
night
has
enveloped
and
eclipsed
his
enemies
his
name
beloved
and
adored
by
a
few
disciples
now
commands
the
reverence
of
kings
and
nations
of
the
world
his
power
is
eternal
his
sovereignty
will
continue
forever
while
those
who
opposed
him
are
sleeping
in
the
dust
their
very
names
unknown
forgotten
the
little
army
of
disciples
has
become
a
mighty
cohort
of
millions
the
heavenly
host
the
supreme
concourse
are
his
legions
the
word
of
god
is
his
sword
the
power
of
god
is
his
victory
jesus
christ
knew
this
would
come
to
pass
and
was
content
to
suffer
his
abasement
was
his
glorification
his
crown
of
thorns
a
heavenly
diadem
when
they
pressed
it
upon
his
blessed
head
and
spat
in
his
beautiful
face
they
laid
the
foundation
of
his
everlasting
kingdom
he
still
reigns
while
they
and
their
names
have
become
lost
and
unknown
he
is
eternal
and
glorious
they
are
nonexistent
they
sought
to
destroy
him
but
they
destroyed
themselves
and
increased
the
intensity
of
his
flame
by
the
winds
of
their
opposition
through
his
death
and
teachings
we
have
entered
into
his
kingdom
his
essential
teaching
was
the
unity
of
mankind
and
the
attainment
of
supreme
human
virtues
through
love
he
came
to
establish
the
kingdom
of
peace
and
everlasting
life
can
you
find
in
his
words
any
justification
for
discord
and
enmity
the
purpose
of
his
life
and
the
glory
of
his
death
were
to
set
mankind
free
from
the
sins
of
strife
war
and
bloodshed
the
great
nations
of
the
world
boast
that
their
laws
and
civilization
are
based
upon
the
religion
of
christ
why
then
do
they
make
war
upon
each
other
the
kingdom
of
christ
cannot
be
upheld
by
destroying
and
disobeying
it
the
banners
of
his
armies
cannot
lead
the
forces
of
satan
consider
the
sad
picture
of
italy
carrying
war
into
tripoli
if
you
should
announce
that
italy
was
a
barbarous
nation
and
not
christian
this
would
be
vehemently
denied
but
would
christ
sanction
what
they
are
doing
in
tripoli
is
this
destruction
of
human
life
obedience
to
his
laws
and
teachings
where
does
he
command
it
where
does
he
consent
to
it
he
was
killed
by
his
enemies
he
did
not
kill
he
even
loved
and
prayed
for
those
who
hung
him
on
the
cross
therefore
these
wars
and
cruelties
this
bloodshed
and
sorrow
are
antichrist
not
christ
these
are
the
forces
of
death
and
satan
not
the
hosts
of
the
supreme
concourse
of
heaven
no
less
bitter
is
the
conflict
between
sects
and
denominations
christ
was
a
divine
center
of
unity
and
love
whenever
discord
prevails
instead
of
unity
wherever
hatred
and
antagonism
take
the
place
of
love
and
spiritual
fellowship
antichrist
reigns
instead
of
christ
who
is
right
in
these
controversies
and
hatreds
between
the
sects
did
christ
command
them
to
love
or
to
hate
each
other
he
loved
even
his
enemies
and
prayed
in
the
hour
of
his
crucifixion
for
those
who
killed
him
therefore
to
be
a
christian
is
not
merely
to
bear
the
name
of
christ
and
say
i
belong
to
a
christian
government
to
be
a
real
christian
is
to
be
a
servant
in
his
cause
and
kingdom
to
go
forth
under
his
banner
of
peace
and
love
toward
all
mankind
to
be
selfsacrificing
and
obedient
to
become
quickened
by
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
to
be
mirrors
reflecting
the
radiance
of
the
divinity
of
christ
to
be
fruitful
trees
in
the
garden
of
his
planting
to
refresh
the
world
by
the
water
of
life
of
his
teachingsin
all
things
to
be
like
him
and
filled
with
the
spirit
of
his
love
praise
be
to
god
the
light
of
unity
and
love
is
shining
in
these
faces
these
spiritual
susceptibilities
are
the
real
fruits
of
heaven
the
bab
and
bahaullah
over
sixty
years
ago
proclaimed
the
glad
tidings
of
universal
peace
the
bab
was
martyred
in
the
cause
of
god
bahaullah
suffered
forty
years
as
a
prisoner
and
exile
in
order
that
the
kingdom
of
love
might
be
established
in
the
east
and
west
he
has
made
it
possible
for
us
to
meet
here
in
love
and
unity
because
he
suffered
imprisonment
we
are
free
to
proclaim
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
for
which
he
stood
so
long
and
faithfully
he
was
chained
in
dungeons
he
was
without
food
his
companions
were
thieves
and
criminals
he
was
subjected
to
every
kind
of
abuse
and
infliction
but
throughout
it
all
he
never
ceased
to
proclaim
the
reality
of
the
word
of
god
and
the
oneness
of
humanity
we
have
been
brought
together
here
by
the
power
of
his
wordyou
from
america
i
from
persiaall
in
love
and
unity
of
spirit
was
this
possible
in
former
centuries
if
it
is
possible
now
after
fifty
years
of
sacrifice
and
teaching
what
shall
we
expect
in
the
wonderful
centuries
coming
therefore
let
your
faces
be
more
radiant
with
hope
and
heavenly
determination
to
serve
the
cause
of
god
to
spread
the
pure
fragrances
of
the
divine
rose
garden
of
unity
to
awaken
spiritual
susceptibilities
in
the
hearts
of
mankind
to
kindle
anew
the
spirit
of
humanity
with
divine
fires
and
to
reflect
the
glory
of
heaven
to
this
gloomy
world
of
materialism
when
you
possess
these
divine
susceptibilities
you
will
be
able
to
awaken
and
develop
them
in
others
we
cannot
give
of
our
wealth
to
the
poor
unless
we
possess
it
how
can
the
poor
give
to
the
poor
how
can
the
soul
that
is
deprived
of
the
heavenly
bounties
develop
in
other
souls
capacity
to
receive
those
bounties
array
yourselves
in
the
perfection
of
divine
virtues
i
hope
you
may
be
quickened
and
vivified
by
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
then
shall
ye
indeed
become
the
angels
of
heaven
whom
christ
promised
would
appear
in
this
day
to
gather
the
harvest
of
divine
planting

grundy
i
give
you
greeting
in
love
and
unity
the
affairs
of
this
world
are
to
be
accounted
as
nothing
compared
to
the
joy
and
heavenly
happiness
of
meeting
the
friends
of
god
it
is
to
experience
this
great
joy
and
blessing
that
i
have
come
here
although
weary
from
my
long
voyage
upon
the
sea
tonight
i
am
in
the
greatest
happiness
looking
upon
this
concourse
of
god
your
meeting
here
is
surely
an
evidence
that
you
are
upholding
the
cause
of
god
that
you
are
aiding
and
assisting
in
establishing
the
kingdom
of
god
therefore
the
culmination
of
my
happiness
is
to
look
upon
your

and
realize
that
you
have
been
brought

by
the
power
of

divine
fruits

appear
to
give
sustenance
to
the
world
of

hearts
set
aglow
by
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
and
spirits
refreshed
by
the
food
of
the

you
must
go
forth
as
the

nineteen
hundred
years
ago
quickening
the
hearts
of
men
by
the
call
of
glad
tidings
the
light
of
god
in
your
faces
severed
from

therefore
order
your
lives
in

with
the
first
principle
of
the
divine
teaching
which
is
love
service
to

is
service

he
who

a

in
this
day
will
behold
his
reward
in
the
fruits
and
harvest
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
this
timely
seed
when
planted

may
take
a
greater
portion
from

so
that
you
may
become
encircled

the

like
unto
the

they
are
the

counterpart
of
each

whatever
objects
appear
in
this
world
of
existence
are
the
outer
pictures
of
the
world
of
heaven
when
we
look
upon
the
phenomenal
world
we
perceive
that
it
is
divided
into
four
seasons
one
is
the
season
of
spring
another
the
season
of
summer
another
autumn
and
then
these
three
seasons
are
followed
by
winter
when
the
season
of
spring
appears
in
the
arena
of
existence
the
whole
world
is
rejuvenated
and
finds
new

the

that
the

are
all
about
us
wonderful
flowers
hyacinths
and
roses
perfume
the

the

are
full

are
followed
by
fruit
the
spring
and
summer
are
followed
by
autumn
and
winter
the
flowers
wither
and
are
no
more
the
leaves
turn
gray
and
life
has
gone
then
comes
another
springtime
the
former
springtime
is
renewed
again
a
new
life
stirs
within
everything
the
appearances
of
the
manifestations
of
god
are
the
divine
springtime
when
christ
appeared
in
this
world
it
was
like
the
vernal
bounty
the
outpouring
descended
the
effulgences
of
the
merciful
encircled
all
things
the
human
world
found
new
life
even
the
physical
world
partook
of
it
the
divine
perfections
were
upraised
souls
were
trained
in
the
school
of
heaven
so
that
all
grades
of
human
existence
received
life
and
light
then
by
degrees
these
fragrances
of
heaven
were
discontinued
the
season
of
winter
came
upon
the
world
the
beauties
of
spring
vanished
the
excellences
and
perfections
passed
away
the
lights
and
quickening
were
no
longer
evident
the
phenomenal
world
and
its
materialities
conquered
everything
the
spiritualities
of
life
were
lost
the
world
of
existence
became
life
unto
a
lifeless
body
there
was
no
trace
of
the
spring
left
bahaullah
has
come
into
this

he
has
renewed
that
springtime
the
same

wafting
the
same
heat
of
the
sun

the

notes
by
ahmad
sohrab
and
howard
macnutt
in
his
scriptural
lesson
this
morning
the
revered
doctor
read
a
verse
from
the
epistle
of
st
paul
to
the
corinthians
for
now
we
see
through
a
glass
darkly
but
then
face
to
face
the
light
of
truth
has
heretofore
been
seen
dimly
through
variegated
glasses
but
now
the
splendors
of
divinity
shall
be
visible
through
the
translucent
mirrors
of
pure
hearts
and
spirits
the
light
of
truth
is
the
divine
teaching
heavenly
instruction
merciful
principles
and
spiritual
civilization
since
my
arrival
in
this
country
i
find
that
material
civilization
has
progressed
greatly
that
commerce
has
attained
the
utmost
degree
of
expansion
arts
agriculture
and
all
details
of
material
civilization
have
reached
the
highest
stage
of
perfection
but
spiritual
civilization
has
been
left
behind
material
civilization
is
like
unto
the
lamp
while
spiritual
civilization
is
the
light
in
that
lamp
if
the
material
and
spiritual
civilization
become
united
then
we
will
have
the
light
and
the
lamp
together
and
the
outcome
will
be
perfect
for
material
civilization
is
like
unto
a
beautiful
body
and
spiritual
civilization
is
like
unto
the
spirit
of
life
if
that
wondrous
spirit
of
life
enters
this
beautiful
body
the
body
will
become
a
channel
for
the
distribution
and
development
of
the
perfections
of
humanity
jesus
christ
came
to
teach
the
people
of
the
world
this
heavenly
civilization
and
not
material
civilization
he
breathed
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
into
the
body
of
the
world
and
established
an
illumined
civilization
among
the
principles
of
divine
civilization
he
came
to
proclaim
is
the
most
great
peace
of
mankind
among
his
principles
of
spiritual
civilization
is
the
oneness
of
the
kingdom
of
humanity
among
the
principles
of
heavenly
civilization
he
brought
is
the
virtue
of
the
human
world
among
the
principles
of
celestial
civilization
he
announced
is
the
improvement
and
betterment
of
human
morals
today
the
world
of
humanity
is
in
need
of
international
unity
and
conciliation
to
establish
these
great
fundamental
principles
a
propelling
power
is
needed
it
is
selfevident
that
the
unity
of
the
human
world
and
the
most
great
peace
cannot
be
accomplished
through
material
means
they
cannot
be
established
through
political
power
for
the
political
interests
of
nations
are
various
and
the
policies
of
peoples
are
divergent
and
conflicting
they
cannot
be
founded
through
racial
or
patriotic
power
for
these
are
human
powers
selfish
and
weak
the
very
nature
of
racial
differences
and
patriotic
prejudices
prevents
the
realization
of
this
unity
and
agreement
therefore
it
is
evidenced
that
the
promotion
of
the
oneness
of
the
kingdom
of
humanity
which
is
the
essence
of
the
teachings
of
all
the
manifestations
of
god
is
impossible
except
through
the
divine
power
and
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
other
powers
are
too
weak
and
are
incapable
of
accomplishing
this
for
man
two
wings
are
necessary
one
wing
is
physical
power
and
material
civilization
the
other
is
spiritual
power
and
divine
civilization
with
one
wing
only
flight
is
impossible
two
wings
are
essential
therefore
no
matter
how
much
material
civilization
advances
it
cannot
attain
to
perfection
except
through
the
uplift
of
spiritual
civilization
all
the
prophets
have
come
to
promote
divine
bestowals
to
found
the
spiritual
civilization
and
teach
the
principles
of
morality
therefore
we
must
strive
with
all
our
powers
so
that
spiritual
influences
may
gain
the
victory
for
material
forces
have
attacked
mankind
the
world
of
humanity
is
submerged
in
a
sea
of
materialism
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
are
seen
but
dimly
and
darkly
through
opaque
glasses
the
penetrative
power
of
the
divine
bounty
is
not
fully
manifest
in
persia
among
the
various
religions
and
sects
there
were
intense
differences
bahaullah
appeared
in
that
country
and
founded
the
spiritual
civilization
he
established
affiliation
among
the
various
peoples
promoted
the
oneness
of
the
human
world
and
unfurled
the
banner
of
the
most
great
peace
he
wrote
special
epistles
covering
these
facts
to
all
the
kings
and
rulers
of
nations
sixty
years
ago
he
conveyed
his
message
to
the
leaders
of
the
political
world
and
to
high
dignitaries
of
the
spiritual
world
therefore
spiritual
civilization
is
progressing
in
the
orient
and
oneness
of
humanity
and
peace
among
the
nations
is
being
accomplished
step
by
step
now
i
find
a
strong
movement
for
universal
peace
emanating
from
america
it
is
my
hope
that
this
standard
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
may
be
upraised
with
the
utmost
solidity
so
that
the
orient
and
occident
may
become
perfectly
reconciled
and
attain
complete
intercommunication
the
hearts
of
the
east
and
west
become
united
and
attracted
real
union
become
unveiled
the
light
of
guidance
shine
divine
effulgences
be
seen
day
by
day
so
that
the
world
of
humanity
may
find
complete
tranquillity
the
eternal
happiness
of
man
become
evident
and
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
world
be
as
mirrors
in
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
may
be
reflected
consequently
it
is
my
request
that
you
should
strive
so
that
the
light
of
reality
may
shine
and
the
everlasting
felicity
of
the
world
of
man
become
apparent
i
will
pray
for
you
so
you
may
attain
this
everlasting
happiness
when
i
arrived
in
this
city
i
was
made
very
happy
for
i
perceived
that
the
people
here
have
capacity
for
divine
bestowals
and
have
worthiness
for
the
civilization
of
heaven
i
pray
that
you
may
attain
to
all
merciful
bounties
o
almighty
o
god
o
thou
compassionate
one
this
servant
of
thine
has
hastened
to
the
regions
of
the
west
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
east
that
perchance
these
nostrils
may
be
perfumed
by
the
fragrances
of
thy
bestowals
that
the
breeze
of
the
rose
garden
of
guidance
may
blow
over
these
cities
that
the
people
may
attain
to
the
capacity
of
receiving
thy
favors
that
the
hearts
may
be
rejoiced
through
thy
glad

that
the

i
have
come
from
distant
lands
to
visit
the
meetings
and
assemblies
of
this
country
in
every
meeting
i
find
people
gathered
loving
each
other
therefore
i
am
greatly
pleased
the
bond
of
union
is
evidenced
in
this
assembly
today
where
the
power
of
god
has
brought
together
in
faith
agreement
and
concord
those
who
are
engaged
in
furthering
the
development
of
the
human
world
it
is
my
hope
that
all
mankind
may
become
similarly
united
in
the
bond
and
agreement
of
love
unity
is
the
expression
of
the
loving
power
of
god
and
reflects
the
reality
of
divinity
it
is
resplendent
in
this
day
through
the
bestowals
of
light
upon
humanity
throughout
the
universe
the
divine
power
is
effulgent
in
endless
images
and
pictures
the
world
of
creation
the
world
of
humanity
may
be
likened
to
the
earth
itself
and
the
divine
power
to
the
sun
this
sun
has
shone
upon
all
mankind
in
the
endless
variety
of
its
reflections
the
divine
will
is
manifested
consider
how
all
are
recipients
of
the
bounty
of
the
same
sun
at
most
the
difference
between
them
is
that
of
degree
for
the
effulgence
is
one
effulgence
the
one
light
emanating
from
the
sun
this
will
express
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
body
politic
or
the
social
unity
of
the
human
world
may
be
likened
to
an
ocean
and
each
member
each
individual
a
wave
upon
that
same
ocean
the
light
of
the
sun
becomes
apparent
in
each
object
according
to
the
capacity
of
that
object
the
difference
is
simply
one
of
degree
and
receptivity
the
stone
would
be
a
recipient
only
to
a
limited
extent
another
created
thing
might
be
as
a
mirror
wherein
the
sun
is
fully
reflected
but
the
same
light
shines
upon
both
the
most
important
thing
is
to
polish
the
mirrors
of
hearts
in
order
that
they
may
become
illumined
and
receptive
of
the
divine
light
one
heart
may
possess
the
capacity
of
the
polished
mirror
another
be
covered
and
obscured
by
the
dust
and
dross
of
this
world
although
the
same
sun
is
shining
upon
both
in
the
mirror
which
is
polished
pure
and
sanctified
you
may
behold
the
sun
in
all
its
fullness
glory
and
power
revealing
its
majesty
and
effulgence
but
in
the
mirror
which
is
rusted
and
obscured
there
is
no
capacity
for
reflection
although
so
far
as
the
sun
itself
is
concerned
it
is
shining
thereon
and
is
neither
lessened
nor
deprived
therefore
our
duty
lies
in
seeking
to
polish
the
mirrors
of
our
hearts
in
order
that
we
shall
become
reflectors
of
that
light
and
recipients
of
the
divine
bounties
which
may
be
fully
revealed
through
them
this
means
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
that
is
to
say
when
this
human
body
politic
reaches
a
state
of
absolute
unity
the
effulgence
of
the
eternal
sun
will
make
its
fullest
light
and
heat
manifest
therefore
we
must
not
make
distinctions
between
individual
members
of
the
human
family
we
must
not
consider
any
soul
as
barren
or
deprived
our
duty
lies
in
educating
souls
so
that
the
sun
of
the
bestowals
of
god
shall
become
resplendent
in
them
and
this
is
possible
through
the
power
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
the
more
love
is
expressed
among
mankind
and
the
stronger
the
power
of
unity
the
greater
will
be
this
reflection
and
revelation
for
the
greatest
bestowal
of
god
is
love
love
is
the
source
of
all
the
bestowals
of
god
until
love
takes
possession
of
the
heart
no
other
divine
bounty
can
be
revealed
in
it
all
the
prophets
have
striven
to
make
love
manifest
in
the
hearts
of
men
jesus
christ
sought
to
create
this
love
in
the
hearts
he
suffered
all
difficulties
and
ordeals
that
perchance
the
human
heart
might
become
the
fountain
source
of
love
therefore
we
must
strive
with
all
our
heart
and
soul
that
this
love
may
take
possession
of
us
so
that
all
humanitywhether
it
be
in
the
east
or
in
the
westmay
be
connected
through
the
bond
of
this
divine
affection
for
we
are
all
the
waves
of
one
sea
we
have
come
into
being
through
the
same
bestowal
and
are
recipients
from
the
same
center
the
lights
of
earth
are
all
acceptable
but
the
center
of
effulgence
is
the
sun
and
we
must
direct
our
gaze
to
the
sun
god
is
the
supreme
center
the
more
we
turn
toward
this
center
of
light
the
greater
will
be
our
capacity
in
the
orient
there
were
great
differences
among
races
and
peoples
they
hated
each
other
and
there
was
no
association
among
them
various
and
divergent
sects
were
hostile
irreconcilable
the
different
races
were
in
constant
war
and
conflict
about
sixty
years
ago
bahaullah
appeared
upon
the
eastern
horizon
he
caused
love
and
unity
to
become
manifest
among
these
antagonistic
peoples
he
united
them
with
the
bond
of
love
their
former
hatred
and
animosity
passed
away
love
and
unity
reigned
instead
it
was
a
dark
world
it
became
radiant
a
new
springtime
appeared
through
him
for
the
sun
of
truth
had
risen
again
in
the
fields
and
meadows
of
human
hearts
variegated
flowers
of
inner
significance
were
blooming
and
the
good
fruits
of
the
kingdom
of
god
became
manifest
i
have
come
here
with
this
mission
that
through
your
endeavors
through
your
heavenly
morals
through
your
devoted
efforts
a
perfect
bond
of
unity
and
love
may
be
established
between
the
east
and
the
west
so
that
the
bestowals
of
god
may
descend
upon
all
and
that
all
may
be
seen
to
be
the
parts
of
the
same
treethe
great
tree
of
the
human
family
for
mankind
may
be
likened
to
the
branches
leaves
blossoms
and
fruit
of
that
tree
the
favors
of
god
are
unending
limitless
infinite
bounties
have
encompassed
the
world
we
must
emulate
the
bounties
of
god
and
just
as
each
one
of
themthe
bounty
of
life
for
instancesurrounds
and
encompasses
all
so
likewise
must
we
be
connected
and
blended
together
until
each
part
shall
become
the
expression
of
the
whole
consider
we
plant
a
seed
a
complete
and
perfect
tree
appears
from
it
and
from
each
seed
of
this
tree
another
tree
can
be
produced
therefore
the
part
is
expressive
of
the
whole
for
this
seed
was
a
part
of
the
tree
but
therein
potentially
was
the
whole
tree
so
each
one
of
us
may
become
expressive
or
representative
of
all
the
bounties
of
life
to
mankind
this
is
the
unity
of
the
world
of
humanity
this
is
the
bestowal
of
god
this
is
the
felicity
of
the
human
world
and
this
is
the
manifestation
of
the
divine
favor
april
talk
at
home
of
mountfort
mills
west
end
avenue
new
york
compiled
from
stenographic
notes
by
howard
macnutt
a
few
days
ago
i
arrived
in
new
york
coming
direct
from
alexandria
on
a
former
trip
i
traveled
to
europe
visiting
paris
and
london
paris
is
most
beautiful
in
outward
appearance
the
evidences
of
material
civilization
there
are
very
great
but
the
spiritual
civilization
is
far
behind
i
found
the
people
of
that
city
submerged
and
drowning
in
a
sea
of
materialism
their
conversations
and
discussions
were
limited
to
natural
and
physical
phenomena
without
mention
of
god
i
was
greatly
astonished
most
of
the
scholars
professors
and
learned
men
proved
to
be
materialists
i
said
to
them
i
am
surprised
and
astonished
that
men
of
such
perceptive
caliber
and
evident
knowledge
should
still
be
captives
of
nature
not
recognizing
the
selfevident
reality
the
phenomenal
world
is
entirely
subject
to
the
rule
and
control
of
natural
law
these
myriad
suns
satellites
and
heavenly
bodies
throughout
endless
space
are
all
captives
of
nature
they
cannot
transgress
in
a
single
point
or
particular
the
fixed
laws
which
govern
the
physical
universe
the
sun
in
its
immensity
the
ocean
in
its
vastness
are
incapable
of
violating
these
universal
laws
all
phenomenal
beingsthe
plants
in
their
kingdom
even
the
animals
with
their
intelligenceare
natures
subjects
and
captives
all
live
within
the
bounds
of
natural
law
and
nature
is
the
ruler
of
all
except
man
man
is
not
the
captive
of
nature
for
although
according
to
natural
law
he
is
a
being
of
the
earth
yet
he
guides
ships
over
the
ocean
flies
through
the
air
in
airplanes
descends
in
submarines
therefore
he
has
overcome
natural
law
and
made
it
subservient
to
his
wishes
for
instance
he
imprisons
in
an
incandescent
lamp
the
illimitable
natural
energy
called
electricitya
material
force
which
can
cleave
mountainsand
bids
it
give
him
light
he
takes
the
human
voice
and
confines
it
in
the
phonograph
for
his
benefit
and
amusement
according
to
his
natural
power
man
should
be
able
to
communicate
a
limited
distance
but
by
overcoming
the
restrictions
of
nature
he
can
annihilate
space
and
send
telephone
messages
thousands
of
miles
all
the
sciences
arts
and
discoveries
were
mysteries
of
nature
and
according
to
natural
law
these
mysteries
should
remain
latent
hidden
but
man
has
proceeded
to
break
this
law
free
himself
from
this
rule
and
bring
them
forth
into
the
realm
of
the
visible
therefore
he
is
the
ruler
and
commander
of
nature
man
has
intelligence
nature
has
not
man
has
volition
nature
has
none
man
has
memory
nature
is
without
it
man
has
the
reasoning
faculty
nature
is
deprived
man
has
the
perceptive
faculty
nature
cannot
perceive
it
is
therefore
proved
and
evident
that
man
is
nobler
than
nature
if
we
accept
the
supposition
that
man
is
but
a
part
of
nature
we
are
confronted
by
an
illogical
statement
for
this
is
equivalent
to
claiming
that
a
part
may
be
endowed
with
qualities
which
are
absent
in
the
whole
for
man
who
is
a
part
of
nature
has
perception
intelligence
memory
conscious
reflection
and
susceptibility
while
nature
itself
is
quite
bereft
of
them
how
is
it
possible
for
the
part
to
be
possessed
of
qualities
or
faculties
which
are
absent
in
the
whole
the
truth
is
that
god
has
given
to
man
certain
powers
which
are
supernatural
how
then
can
man
be
considered
a
captive
of
nature
is
he
not
dominating
and
controlling
nature
to
his
own
uses
more
and
more
is
he
not
the
very
divinity
of
nature
shall
we
say
nature
is
blind
nature
is
not
perceptive
nature
is
without
volition
and
not
alive
and
then
relegate
man
to
nature
and
its
limitations
how
can
we
answer
this
question
how
will
the
materialists
and
scholastic
atheists
prove
and
support
such
a
supposition
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
themselves
make
natural
laws
subservient
to
their
own
wish
and
purpose
the
proof
is
complete
that
in
man
there
is
a
power
beyond
the
limitations
of
nature
and
that
power
is
the
bestowal
of
god
in
new
york
i
find
the
people
more
endowed
with
spiritual
susceptibilities
they
are
not
mere
captives
of
natures
control
they
are
rising
out
of
the
bonds
and
burden
of
captivity
for
this
reason
i
am
very
happy
and
hopeful
that
god
willing
in
this
populous
country
in
this
vast
continent
of
the
west
the
virtues
of
the
world
of
humanity
shall
become
resplendent
that
the
oneness
of
human
worldpower
the
love
of
god
may
enkindle
the
hearts
and
that
international
peace
may
hoist
its
standards
influencing
all
other
regions
and
countries
from
here
this
is

sohrab
souls
from
the
east
and

have
been

through
the
power

such
a

as
this

impossible
through

a

of

has
never

for
here
tonight
we
find
people
from
remote
regions
of
the
earth
associated
with
the
people
of
america
in
the
utmost
love
and
spiritual
unity
this
is
only
possible
through
the
power
of
god
christ
appeared
in
this
world
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
to
establish
ties
of
unity
and
bonds
of
love
between
the
various
nations
and
different
communities
he
cemented
together
the
sciences
of
rome
and
the
splendors
of
the
civilization
of

he
also
accomplished
affiliation
between
the
assyrian
kingdom
and
the
power
of
egypt
the
blending
of
these
nations
in
unity
love
and
agreement
had
been
impossible
but
christ
through
divine
power
established
this
condition
among
the
children
of
men
a
much
greater
difficulty
confronts
us
today
when
we
endeavor
to
establish
unity
between
the
orient
and
the

bahaullah
through
the
power
of
heaven
has
brought
the
east
and
the

together
erelong
we
shall
know
that
they
have
been
cemented
by
the
power
of
god
the
oneness
of
the
kingdom
of
humanity
will
supplant
the
banner
of
conquest
and
all
communities
of
the
earth
will
gather
under
its
protection
no
nation
with
separate
and
restricted
boundariessuch
as
persia
for

exist
the
united
states
of

be
known

arabiaall
these
various
nations
will
be
welded
together
in
unity
when
the
people
of
the
future
are
asked
to
which
nationality
do
you
belong
the
answer
will
be
to
the
nationality
of
humanity
i
am
living
under
the
shadow
of
bahaullah
i
am
the
servant
of
bahaullah
i
belong
to
the
army
of
the
most
great
peace
the
people
of
the
future

not
say
i
belong

one

the
one

the
one

of
humanityand
then
these
wars
hatreds
and
strifes
will
pass
away
bahaullah
appeared
in
a
country
which
was
the
center
of
prejudice
in
that
country
were
many
different
communities
religions
sects
and
denominations
all
the
animosities
of
past
centuries
existed
among
them
they
were
ready
to
kill
each
other
they
considered
the
killing
of
others
who
did
not
agree
with
them
in
religious
belief
an
act
of
worship
bahaullah
established
such
unity
and
agreement
between
these
various
communities
that
the
greatest
love
and
amity
are
now
witnessed
among
them
today
the
bahais
of
the
east
are
longing
with
deep
desire
to
see
you
face
to
face
their
highest
hope
and
fondest
wish
is
that
the
day
may
come
when
they
will
be
gathered
together
in
an
assembly
with
you
consider
well
the
power
that
accomplished
this
wonderful
transformation
the
body
of
the
human
world
is
sick
its
remedy
and
healing
will
be
the
oneness
of
the
kingdom
of
humanity
its
life
is
the
most
great
peace
its
illumination
and
quickening
is
love
its
happiness
is
the
attainment
of
spiritual
perfections
it
is
my
wish
and
hope
that
in
the
bounties
and
favors
of
the
blessed
perfection
we
may
find
a
new
life
acquire
a
new
power
and
attain
to
a
wonderful
and
supreme
source
of
energy
so
that
the
most
great
peace
of
divine
intention
shall
be
established
upon
the
foundations
of
the
unity
of
the
world
of
men
with
god
may
the
love
of
god
be
spread
from
this
city
from
this
meeting
to
all
the
surrounding
countries
nay
may
america

the
distributing
center
of
spiritual
enlightenment

all
the
world

this
heavenly
blessing
for
america
has
developed
powers
and
capacities
greater
and
more
wonderful
than
other
nations
while
it
is
true
that
its
people
have
attained
a
marvelous
material
civilization
i
hope
that
spiritual
forces
may
animate
this
great
body
and
a
corresponding
spiritual
civilization
be
established
may
the
inhabitants
of
this
country
become
like

notes
by
howard
macnutt
during
my
visit
to
london
and
paris
last
year
i
had
many
talks
with
the
materialistic
philosophers
of
europe
the
basis
of
all
their
conclusions
is
that
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
of
phenomena
is
according
to
a
fixed
invariable
lawa
law
mathematically
exact
in
its
operation
through
the
senses
for
instance
the
eye
sees
a
chair
therefore
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
chairs
existence
the
eye
looks
up
into
the
heavens
and
beholds
the
sun
i
see
flowers
upon
this
table
i
smell
their
fragrance
i
hear
sounds
outside
etc
this
they
say
is
a
fixed
mathematical
law
of
perception
and
deduction
the
operation
of
which
admits
of
no
doubt
whatever
for
inasmuch
as
the
universe
is
subject
to
our
sensing
the
proof
is
selfevident
that
our
knowledge
of
it
must
be
gained
through
the
avenues
of
the
senses
that
is
to
say
the
materialists
announce
that
the
criterion
and
standard
of
human
knowledge
is
sense
perception
among
the
greeks
and
romans
the
criterion
of
knowledge
was
reasonthat
whatever
is
provable
and
acceptable
by
reason
must
necessarily
be
admitted
as
true
a
third
standard
or
criterion
is
the
opinion
held
by
theologians
that
traditions
or
prophetic
statement
and
interpretations
constitute
the
basis
of
human
knowing
there
is
still
another
a
fourth
criterion
upheld
by
religionists
and
metaphysicians
who
say
that
the
source
and
channel
of
all
human
penetration
into
the
unknown
is
through
inspiration
briefly
then
these
four
criteria
according
to
the
declarations
of
men
are
first
sense
perception
second
reason
third
traditions
fourth
inspiration
in
europe
i
told
the
philosophers
and
scientists
of
materialism
that
the
criterion
of
the
senses
is
not
reliable
for
instance
consider
a
mirror
and
the
images
reflected
in
it
these
images
have
no
actual
corporeal
existence
yet
if
you
had
never
seen
a
mirror
you
would
firmly
insist
and
believe
that
they
were
real
the
eye
sees
a
mirage
upon
the
desert
as
a
lake
of
water
but
there
is
no
reality
in
it
as
we
stand
upon
the
deck
of
a
steamer
the
shore
appears
to
be
moving
yet
we
know
the
land
is
stationary
and
we
are
moving
the
earth
was
believed
to
be
fixed
and
the
sun
revolving
about
it
but
although
this
appears
to
be
so
the
reverse
is
now
known
to
be
true
a
whirling
torch
makes
a
circle
of
fire
appear
before
the
eye
yet
we
realize
there
is
but
one
point
of
light
we
behold
a
shadow
moving
upon
the
ground
but
it
has
no
material
existence
no
substance
in
deserts
the
atmospheric
effects
are
particularly
productive
of
illusions
which
deceive
the
eye
once
i
saw
a
mirage
in
which
a
whole
caravan
appeared
traveling
upward
into
the
sky
in
the
far
north
other
deceptive
phenomena
appear
and
baffle
human
vision
sometimes
three
or
four
suns
called
by
scientists
mock
suns
will
be
shining
at
the
same
time
whereas
we
know
that
the
great
solar
orb
is
one
and
that
it
remains
fixed
and
single
in
brief
the
senses
are
continually
deceived
and
we
are
unable
to
separate
that
which
is
reality
from
that
which
is
not
as
to
the
second
criterionreasonthis
likewise
is
unreliable
and
not
to
be
depended
upon
this
human
world
is
an
ocean
of
varying
opinions
if
reason
is
the
perfect
standard
and
criterion
of
knowledge
why
are
opinions
at
variance
and
why
do
philosophers
disagree
so
completely
with
each
other
this
is
a
clear
proof
that
human
reason
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
as
an
infallible
criterion
for
instance
great
discoveries
and
announcements
of
former
centuries
are
continually
upset
and
discarded
by
the
wise
men
of
today
mathematicians
astronomers
chemical
scientists
continually
disprove
and
reject
the
conclusions
of
the
ancients
nothing
is
fixed
nothing
final
everything
is
continually
changing
because
human
reason
is
progressing
along
new
roads
of
investigation
and
arriving
at
new
conclusions
every
day
in
the
future
much
that
is
announced
and
accepted
as
true
now
will
be
rejected
and
disproved
and
so
it
will
continue
ad
infinitum
when
we
consider
the
third
criteriontraditionsupheld
by
theologians
as
the
avenue
and
standard
of
knowledge
we
find
this
source
equally
unreliable
and
unworthy
of
dependence
for
religious
traditions
are
the
report
and
record
of
understanding
and
interpretation
of
the
book
by
what
means
has
this
understanding
this
interpretation
been
reached
by
the
analysis
of
human
reason
when
we
read
the
book
of
god
the
faculty
of
comprehension
by
which
we
form
conclusions
is
reason
reason
is
mind
if
we
are
not
endowed
with
perfect
reason
how
can
we
comprehend
the
meanings
of
the
word
of
god
therefore
human
reason
as
already
pointed
out
is
by
its
very
nature
finite
and
faulty
in
conclusions
it
cannot
surround
the
reality
itself
the
infinite
word
inasmuch
as
the
source
of
traditions
and
interpretations
is
human
reason
and
human
reason
is
faulty
how
can
we
depend
upon
its
findings
for
real
knowledge
the
fourth
criterion
i
have
named
is
inspiration
through
which
it
is
claimed
the
reality
of
knowledge
is
attainable
what
is
inspiration
it
is
the
influx
of
the
human
heart
but
what
are
satanic
promptings
which
afflict
mankind
they
are
the
influx
of
the
heart
also
how
shall
we
differentiate
between
them
the
question
arises
how
shall
we
know
whether
we
are
following
inspiration
from
god
or
satanic
promptings
of
the
human
soul
briefly
the
point
is
that
in
the
human
material
world
of
phenomena
these
four
are
the
only
existing
criteria
or
avenues
of
knowledge
and
all
of
them
are
faulty
and
unreliable
what
then
remains
how
shall
we
attain
the
reality
of
knowledge
by
the
breaths
and
promptings
of
the
holy
spirit
which
is
light
and
knowledge
itself
through
it
the
human
mind
is
quickened
and
fortified
into
true
conclusions
and
perfect
knowledge
this
is
conclusive
argument
showing
that
all
available
human
criteria
are
erroneous
and
defective
but
the
divine
standard
of
knowledge
is
infallible
therefore
man
is
not
justified
in
saying
i
know
because
i
perceive
through
my
senses
or
i
know
because
it
is
proved
through
my
faculty
of
reason
or
i
know
because
it
is
according
to
tradition
and
interpretation
of
the
holy
book
or
i
know
because
i
am
inspired
all
human
standards
of
judgment
are
faulty
finite

notes
by
john
g
grundy
in
the
holy
books
it
is
recorded
that
when
the
sun
of
truth
dawns
it
will
appear
in
the
east
and
its
light
will
be
reflected
in
the
west
already
its
dawning
has
taken
place
in
the
east
and
its
signs
are
appearing
in
the
west
its
illumination
shall
spread
rapidly
and
widely
in
the
occident
the
sun
of
truth
has
risen
in
persia
and
its
effulgence
is
now
manifest
here
in
america
this
is
the
greatest
proof
of
its
appearance
in
the
horizon
of
the
world
as
recorded
in
the
heavenly
books
praise
be
to
god
that
which
is
prophesied
in
the
holy
books
has
been
fulfilled
on
sunday
last
at
carnegie
hall
the
revered
soul
who
introduced
abdulbaha
gave
voice
to
the
statement
that
according
to
tradition
demons
would
appear
from
the
land
of
the
sunrise
but
now
we
find
angels
appearing
instead
at
the
time
this
statement
was
made
a
reply
was
not
possible
but
today
we
will
speak
of
it
the
great
spiritual
lights
have
always
appeared
in
the
east
the
blessed
perfection
bahaullah
appeared
in
the
east
jesus
christ
dawned
upon
the
horizon
of
the
east
moses
aaron
joseph
and
all
the
israelitish
prophets
such
as
jeremiah
ezekiel
isaiah
and
others
appeared
from
the
orient
the
lights
of
muhammad
and
the
bab
shone
from
the
east
the
eastern
horizon
has
been
flooded
with
the
effulgence
of
these
great
lights
and
only
from
the
east
have
they
risen
to
shine
upon
the
west
nowpraise
be
to
godyou
are
living
in
the
dawn
of
a
cycle
when
the
sun
of
truth
is
again
shining
forth
from
the
east
illumining
all
regions
the
world
has
become
a
new
world
the
darkness
of
night
which
has
enveloped
humanity
is
passing
a
new
day
has
dawned
divine
susceptibilities
and
heavenly
capacities
are
developing
in
human
souls
under
the
training
of
the
sun
of
truth
the
capacities
of
souls
are
different
their
conditions
are
various
for
example
certain
minerals
come
from
the
stony
regions
of
the
earth
all
are
minerals
all
are
produced
by
the
same
sun
but
one
remains
a
stone
while
another
develops
the
capacity
of
a
glittering
gem
or
jewel
from
one
plot
of
land
tulips
and
hyacinths
grow
from
another
thorns
and
thistles
each
plot
receives
the
bounty
of
the
sunshine
but
the
capacity
to
receive
it
is
not
the
same
therefore
it
is
requisite
that
we
must
develop
capacity
and
divine
susceptibility
in
order
that
the
merciful
bounty
of
the
sun
of
truth
intended
for
this
age
and
time
in
which
we
are
living
may
reflect
from
us
as
light
from
pure
crystals
the
bounties
of
the
blessed
perfection
are
infinite
we
must
endeavor
to
increase
our
capacity
daily
to
strengthen
and
enlarge
our
capabilities
for
receiving
them
to
become
as
perfect
mirrors
the
more
polished
and
clean
the
mirror
the
more
effulgent
is
its
reflection
of
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
truth
be
like
a
wellcultivated
garden
wherein
the
roses
and
variegated
flowers
of
heaven
are
growing
in
fragrance
and
beauty
it
is
my
hope
that
your
hearts
may
become
as
ready
ground
carefully
tilled
and
prepared
upon
which
the
divine
showers
of
the
bounties
of
the
blessed
perfection
may
descend
and
the
zephyrs
of
this
divine
springtime
may
blow
with
quickening
breath
then
will
the
garden
of
your
hearts
bring
forth
its
flowers
of
delightful
fragrance
to
refresh
the
nostril
of
the
heavenly
gardener
let
your
hearts
reflect
the
glories
of
the
sun
of
truth
in
their
many
colors
to
gladden
the
eye
of
the
divine
cultivator
who
has
nourished
them
day
by
day
become
more
closely
attracted
in
order
that
the
love
of
god
may
illumine
all
those
with
whom
you
come
in
contact
be
as
one
spirit
one
soul
leaves
of
one
tree
flowers
of
one
garden
waves
of
one
ocean
as
difference
in
degree
of
capacity
exists
among
human
souls
as
difference
in
capability
is
found
therefore
individualities
will
differ
one
from
another
but
in
reality
this
is
a
reason
for
unity
and
not
for
discord
and
enmity
if
the
flowers
of
a
garden
were
all
of
one
color
the
effect
would
be
monotonous
to
the
eye
but
if
the
colors
are
variegated
it
is
most
pleasing
and
wonderful
the
difference
in
adornment
of
color
and
capacity
of
reflection
among
the
flowers
gives
the
garden
its
beauty
and
charm
therefore
although
we
are
of
different
individualities
different
in
ideas
and
of
various
fragrances
let
us
strive
like
flowers
of
the
same
divine
garden
to
live
together
in
harmony
even
though
each
soul
has
its
own
individual
perfume
and
color
all
are
reflecting
the
same
light
all
contributing
fragrance
to
the
same
breeze
which
blows
through
the
garden
all
continuing
to
grow
in
complete
harmony
and
accord
become
as
waves
of
one
sea
trees
of
one
forest
growing
in
the
utmost
love
agreement
and
unity
if
you
attain
to
such
a
capacity
of
love
and
unity
the
blessed
perfection
will
shower
infinite
graces
of
the
spiritual
kingdom
upon
you
guide
protect
and
preserve
you
under
the
shadow
of
his
word
increase
your
happiness
in
this
world
and
uphold
you
through
all
difficulties
therefore
it
is
my
hope
that
day
by
day
you
will
become
more
and
more
effulgent
in
the
horizon
of
heaven
advance
nearer
and
nearer
toward
the
kingdom
of
abha
attain
greater
and
greater
bounties
of
the
blessed
perfection
i
am
joyful
for
i
perceive
the
evidences
of
great
love
among
you
i
go
to
chicago
and
when
i
return
i
hope
that
love
will
have
become
infinite
then
will
it
be

of
the
history
of
the
bahai
revelation
the
blessed
perfection
bahaullah
belonged
to
the
nobility
of
persia
from
earliest
childhood
he
was
distinguished
among
his
relatives
and
friends
they
said
this
child
has
extraordinary
power
in
wisdom
intelligence
and
as
a
source
of
new
knowledge
he
was
advanced
beyond
his
age
and
superior
to
his
surroundings
all
who
knew
him
were
astonished
at
his
precocity
it
was
usual
for
them
to
say
such
a
child
will
not
live
for
it
is
commonly
believed
that
precocious
children
do
not
reach
maturity
during
the
period
of
youth
the
blessed
perfection
did
not
enter
school
he
was
not
willing
to
be
taught
this
fact
is
well
established
among
the
persians
of
tihran
nevertheless
he
was
capable
of
solving
the
difficult
problems
of
all
who
came
to
him
in
whatever
meeting
scientific
assembly
or
theological
discussion
he
was
found
he
became
the
authority
of
explanation
upon
intricate
and
abstruse
questions
presented
until
his
father
passed
away
bahaullah
did
not
seek
position
or
political
station
notwithstanding
his
connection
with
the
government
this
occasioned
surprise
and
comment
it
was
frequently
said
how
is
it
that
a
young
man
of
such
keen
intelligence
and
subtle
perception
does
not
seek
lucrative
appointments
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
position
is
open
to
him
this
is
an
historical
statement
fully
attested
by
the
people
of
persia
he
was
most
generous
giving
abundantly
to
the
poor
none
who
came
to
him
were
turned
away
the
doors
of
his
house
were
open
to
all
he
always
had
many
guests
this
unbounded
generosity
was
conducive
to
greater
astonishment
from
the
fact
that
he
sought
neither
position
nor
prominence
in
commenting
upon
this
his
friends
said
he
would
become
impoverished
for
his
expenses
were
many
and
his
wealth
becoming
more
and
more
limited
why
is
he
not
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
they
inquired
of
each
other
but
some
who
were
wise
declared
this
personage
is
connected
with
another
world
he
has
something
sublime
within
him
that
is
not
evident
now
the
day
is
coming
when
it
will
be
manifested
in
truth
the
blessed
perfection
was
a
refuge
for
every
weak
one
a
shelter
for
every
fearing
one
kind
to
every
indigent
one
lenient
and
loving
to
all
creatures
he
became
wellknown
in
regard
to
these
qualities
before
the
bab
appeared
then
bahaullah
declared
the
babs
mission
to
be
true
and
promulgated
his
teachings
the
bab
announced
that
the
greater
manifestation
would
take
place
after
him
and
called
the
promised
one
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
saying
that
nine
years
later
the
reality
of
his
own
mission
would
become
apparent
in
his
writings
he
stated
that
in
the
ninth
year
this
expected
one
would
be
known
in
the
ninth
year
they
would
attain
to
all
glory
and
felicity
in
the
ninth
year
they
would
advance
rapidly
between
bahaullah
and
the
bab
there
was
communication
privately
the
bab
wrote
a
letter
containing
three
hundred
and
sixty
derivatives
of
the
root
baha
the
bab
was
martyred
in
tabriz
and
bahaullah
exiled
into
iraq
in
announced
himself
in
baghdad
for
the
persian
government
had
decided
that
as
long
as
he
remained
in
persia
the
peace
of
the
country
would
be
disturbed
therefore
he
was
exiled
in
the
expectation
that
persia
would
become
quiet
his
banishment
however
produced
the
opposite
effect
new
tumult
arose
and
the
mention
of
his
greatness
and
influence
spread
everywhere
throughout
the
country
the
proclamation
of
his
manifestation
and
mission
was
made
in
baghdad
he
called
his
friends
together
there
and
spoke
to
them
of
god
at
one
point
he
left
the
city
and
went
alone
into
the
mountains
of
kurdistan
where
he
made
his
abode
in
caves
and
grottoes
a
part
of
this
time
he
lived
in
the
city
of
sulaymaniyyih
two
years
passed
during
which
neither
his
friends
nor
family
knew
just
where
he
was
although
bahaullah
was
solitary
secluded
and
unknown
in
his
retirement
the
report
spread
throughout
kurdistan
that
this
was
a
most
remarkable
and
learned
personage
gifted
with
a
wonderful
power
of
attraction
in
a
short
time
kurdistan
was
magnetized
with
his
love
during
this
period
bahaullah
lived
in
poverty
his
garments
were
those
of
the
poor
and
needy
his
food
was
that
of
the
indigent
and
lowly
an
atmosphere
of
majesty
haloed
him
as
the
sun
at
midday
everywhere
he
was
greatly
revered
and
beloved
after
two
years
he
returned
to
baghdad
friends
he
had
known
in
sulaymaniyyih
came
to
visit
him
they
found
him
in
his
accustomed
environment
of
ease
and
affluence
and
were
astonished
at
the
appointments
of
one
who
had
lived
in
seclusion
under
such
frugal
conditions
in
kurdistan
the
persian
government
believed
the
banishment
of
the
blessed
perfection
from
persia
would
be
the
extermination
of
his
cause
in
that
country
these
rulers
now
realized
that
it
spread
more
rapidly
his
prestige
increased
his
teachings
became
more
widely
circulated
the
chiefs
of
persia
then
used
their
influence
to
have
bahaullah
exiled
from
baghdad
he
was
summoned
to
constantinople
by
the
turkish
authorities
while
in
constantinople
he
ignored
every
restriction
especially
the
hostility
of
ministers
of
state
and
clergy
the
official
representatives
of
persia
again
brought
their
influence
to
bear
upon
the
turkish
authorities
and
succeeded
in
having
bahaullah
banished
from
constantinople
to
adrianople
the
object
being
to
keep
him
as
far
away
as
possible
from
persia
and
render
his
communication
with
that
country
more
difficult
nevertheless
the
cause
still
spread
and
strengthened
finally
they
consulted
together
and
said
we
have
banished
bahaullah
from
place
to
place
but
each
time
he
is
exiled
his
cause
is
more
widely
extended
his
proclamation
increases
in
power
and
day
by
day
his
lamp
is
becoming
brighter
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
have
exiled
him
to
large
cities
and
populous
centers
therefore
we
will
send
him
to
a
penal
colony
as
a
prisoner
so
that
all
may
know
he
is
the
associate
of
murderers
robbers
and
criminals
in
a
short
time
he
and
his
followers
will
perish
the
sultan
of
turkey
then
banished
him
to
the
prison
of
akka
in
syria
when
bahaullah
arrived
at
akka
through
the
power
of
god
he
was
able
to
hoist
his
banner
his
light
at
first
had
been
a
star
now
it
became
a
mighty
sun
and
the
illumination
of
his
cause
expanded
from
the
east
to
the
west
inside
prison
walls
he
wrote
epistles
to
all
the
kings
and
rulers
of
nations
summoning
them
to
arbitration
and
universal
peace
some
of
the
kings
received
his
words
with
disdain
and
contempt
one
of
these
was
the
sultan
of
the
ottoman
kingdom
napoleon
iii
of
france
did
not
reply
a
second
epistle
was
addressed
to
him
it
stated
i
have
written
you
an
epistle
before
this
summoning
you
to
the
cause
of
god
but
you
are
of
the
heedless
you
have
proclaimed
that
you
were
the
defender
of
the
oppressed
now
it
hath
become
evident
that
you
are
not
nor
are
you
kind
to
your
own
suffering
and
oppressed
people
your
actions
are
contrary
to
your
own
interests
and
your
kingly
pride
must
fall
because
of
your
arrogance
god
shortly
will
destroy
your
sovereignty
france
will
flee
away
from
you
and
you
will
be
overwhelmed
by
a
great
conquest
there
will
be
lamentation
and
mourning
women
bemoaning
the
loss
of
their
sons
this
arraignment
of
napoleon
iii
was
published
and
spread
read
it
and
consider
one
prisoner
single
and
solitary
without
assistant
or
defender
a
foreigner
and
stranger
imprisoned
in
the
fortress
of
akka
writing
such
letters
to
the
emperor
of
france
and
sultan
of
turkey
reflect
upon
this
how
bahaullah
upraised
the
standard
of
his
cause
in
prison
refer
to
history
it
is
without
parallel
no
such
thing
has
happened
before
that
time
nor
sincea
prisoner
and
an
exile
advancing
his
cause
and
spreading
his
teachings
broadcast
so
that
eventually
he
became
powerful
enough
to
conquer
the
very
king
who
banished
him
his
cause
spread
more
and
more
the
blessed
perfection
was
a
prisoner
twentyfive
years
during
all
this
time
he
was
subjected
to
the
indignities
and
revilement
of
the
people
he
was
persecuted
mocked
and
put
in
chains
in
persia
his
properties
were
pillaged
and
his
possessions
confiscated
first
there
was
banishment
from
persia
to
baghdad
then
to
constantinople
then
to
adrianople
finally
from
rumelia
to
the
prison
fortress
of
akka
during
his
lifetime
he
was
intensely
active
his
energy
was
unlimited
scarcely
one
night
was
passed
in
restful
sleep
he
bore
these
ordeals
suffered
these
calamities
and
difficulties
in
order
that
a
manifestation
of
selflessness
and
service
might
become
apparent
in
the
world
of
humanity
that
the
most
great
peace
should
become
a
reality
that
human
souls
might
appear
as
the
angels
of

even
as
it
hath
been

let
us
make
man
in
our
image
briefly
the

bore
all
these
ordeals
and
calamities
in
order
that
our

might
become
enkindled
and
radiant
our

be
glorified
our
faults
become

be
transformed
into

in
order
that
we
might
attain
the
real
fruits
of
humanity
and
acquire
heavenly
graces
in
order
that
although
pilgrims
upon

you
will
see
that
the
heavenly
words
have
established
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
banner
of
the
most
great
peace
has
been
unfurled
and
the
great
community
is
appearing
april
talk
at
earl
hall
columbia
university
new
york
from
stenographic
notes
if
we
look
with
a
perceiving
eye
upon
the
world
of
creation
we
find
that
all
existing
things
may
be
classified
as
follows
first
mineralthat
is
to
say
matter
or
substance
appearing
in
various
forms
of
composition
second
vegetablepossessing
the
virtues
of
the
mineral
plus
the
power
of
augmentation
or
growth
indicating
a
degree
higher
and
more
specialized
than
the
mineral
third
animalpossessing
the
attributes
of
the
mineral
and
vegetable
plus
the
power
of
sense
perception
fourth
humanthe
highest
specialized
organism
of
visible
creation
embodying
the
qualities
of
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
plus
an
ideal
endowment
absolutely
absent
in
the
lower
kingdomsthe
power
of
intellectual
investigation
into
the
mysteries
of
outer
phenomena
the
outcome
of
this
intellectual
endowment
is
science
which
is
especially
characteristic
of
man
this
scientific
power
investigates
and
apprehends
created
objects
and
the
laws
surrounding
them
it
is
the
discoverer
of
the
hidden
and
mysterious
secrets
of
the
material
universe
and
is
peculiar
to
man
alone
the
most
noble
and
praiseworthy
accomplishment
of
man
therefore
is
scientific
knowledge
and
attainment
science
may
be
likened
to
a
mirror
wherein
the
images
of
the
mysteries
of
outer
phenomena
are
reflected
it
brings
forth
and
exhibits
to
us
in
the
arena
of
knowledge
all
the
product
of
the
past
it
links
together
past
and
present
the
philosophical
conclusions
of
bygone
centuries
the
teachings
of
the
prophets
and
wisdom
of
former
sages
are
crystallized
and
reproduced
in
the
scientific
advancement
of
today
science
is
the
discoverer
of
the
past
from
its
premises
of
past
and
present
we
deduce
conclusions
as
to
the
future
science
is
the
governor
of
nature
and
its
mysteries
the
one
agency
by
which
man
explores
the
institutions
of
material
creation
all
created
things
are
captives
of
nature
and
subject
to
its
laws
they
cannot
transgress
the
control
of
these
laws
in
one
detail
or
particular
the
infinite
starry
worlds
and
heavenly
bodies
are
natures
obedient
subjects
the
earth
and
its
myriad
organisms
all
minerals
plants
and
animals
are
thralls
of
its
dominion
but
man
through
the
exercise
of
his
scientific
intellectual
power
can
rise
out
of
this
condition
can
modify
change
and
control
nature
according
to
his
own
wishes
and
uses
science
so
to
speak
is
the
breaker
of
the
laws
of
nature
consider
for
example
that
man
according
to
natural
law
should
dwell
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
by
overcoming
this
law
and
restriction
however
he
sails
in
ships
over
the
ocean
mounts
to
the
zenith
in
airplanes
and
sinks
to
the
depths
of
the
sea
in
submarines
this
is
against
the
fiat
of
nature
and
a
violation
of
her
sovereignty
and
dominion
natures
laws
and
methods
the
hidden
secrets
and
mysteries
of
the
universe
human
inventions
and
discoveries
all
our
scientific
acquisitions
should
naturally
remain
concealed
and
unknown
but
man
through
his
intellectual
acumen
searches
them
out
of
the
plane
of
the
invisible
draws
them
into
the
plane
of
the
visible
exposes
and
explains
them
for
instance
one
of
the
mysteries
of
nature
is
electricity
according
to
nature
this
force
this
energy
should
remain
latent
and
hidden
but
man
scientifically
breaks
through
the
very
laws
of
nature
arrests
it
and
even
imprisons
it
for
his
use
in
brief
man
through
the
possession
of
this
ideal
endowment
of
scientific
investigation
is
the
most
noble
product
of
creation
the
governor
of
nature
he
takes
the
sword
from
natures
hand
and
uses
it
upon
natures
head
according
to
natural
law
night
is
a
period
of
darkness
and
obscurity
but
man
by
utilizing
the
power
of
electricity
by
wielding
this
electric
sword
overcomes
the
darkness
and
dispels
the
gloom
man
is
superior
to
nature
and
makes
nature
do
his
bidding
man
is
a
sensitive
being
nature
is
without
sensation
man
has
memory
and
reason
nature
lacks
them
man
is
nobler
than
nature
there
are
powers
within
him
of
which
nature
is
devoid
it
may
be
claimed
that
these
powers
are
from
nature
itself
and
that
man
is
a
part
of
nature
in
answer
to
this
statement
we
will
say
that
if
nature
is
the
whole
and
man
is
a
part
of
that
whole
how
could
it
be
possible
for
a
part
to
possess
qualities
and
virtues
which
are
absent
in
the
whole
undoubtedly
the
part
must
be
endowed
with
the
same
qualities
and
properties
as
the
whole
for
example
the
hair
is
a
part
of
the
human
anatomy
it
cannot
contain
elements
which
are
not
found
in
other
parts
of
the
body
for
in
all
cases
the
component
elements
of
the
body
are
the
same
therefore
it
is
manifest
and
evident
that
man
although
in
body
a
part
of
nature
nevertheless
in
spirit
possesses
a
power
transcending
nature
for
if
he
were
simply
a
part
of
nature
and
limited
to
material
laws
he
could
possess
only
the
things
which
nature
embodies
god
has
conferred
upon
and
added
to
man
a
distinctive
powerthe
faculty
of
intellectual
investigation
into
the
secrets
of
creation
the
acquisition
of
higher
knowledgethe
greatest
virtue
of
which
is
scientific
enlightenment
this
endowment
is
the
most
praiseworthy
power
of
man
for
through
its
employment
and
exercise
the
betterment
of
the
human
race
is
accomplished
the
development
of
the
virtues
of
mankind
is
made
possible
and
the
spirit
and
mysteries
of
god
become
manifest
therefore
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
my
visit
to
this
university
praise
be
to
god
that
this
country
abounds
in
such
institutions
of
learning
where
the
knowledge
of
sciences
and
arts
may
readily
be
acquired
as
material
and
physical
sciences
are
taught
here
and
are
constantly
unfolding
in
wider
vistas
of
attainment
i
am
hopeful
that
spiritual
development
may
also
follow
and
keep
pace
with
these
outer
advantages
as
material
knowledge
is
illuminating
those
within
the
walls
of
this
great
temple
of
learning
so
also
may
the
light
of
the
spirit
the
inner
and
divine
light
of
the
real
philosophy
glorify
this
institution
the
most
important
principle
of
divine
philosophy
is
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
unity
of
mankind
the
bond
conjoining
east
and
west
the
tie
of
love
which
blends
human
hearts
therefore
it
is
our
duty
to
put
forth
our
greatest
efforts
and
summon
all
our
energies
in
order
that
the
bonds
of
unity
and
accord
may
be
established
among
mankind
for
thousands
of
years
we
have
had
bloodshed
and
strife
it
is
enough
it
is
sufficient
now
is
the
time
to
associate
together
in
love
and
harmony
for
thousands
of
years
we
have
tried
the
sword
and
warfare
let
mankind
for
a
time
at
least
live
in
peace
review
history
and
consider
how
much
savagery
how
much
bloodshed
and
battle
the
world
has
witnessed
it
has
been
either
religious
warfare
political
warfare
or
some
other
clash
of
human
interests
the
world
of
humanity
has
never
enjoyed
the
blessing
of
universal
peace
year
by
year
the
implements
of
warfare
have
been
increased
and
perfected
consider
the
wars
of
past
centuries
only
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
at
the
most
were
killed
but
now
it
is
possible
to
kill
one
hundred
thousand
in
a
single
day
in
ancient
times
warfare
was
carried
on
with
the
sword
today
it
is
the
smokeless
gun
formerly
battleships
were
sailing
vessels
today
they
are
dreadnoughts
consider
the
increase
and
improvement
in
the
weapons
of
war
god
has
created
us
all
human
and
all
countries
of
the
world
are
parts
of
the
same
globe
we
are
all
his
servants
he
is
kind
and
just
to
all
why
should
we
be
unkind
and
unjust
to
each
other
he
provides
for
all
why
should
we
deprive
one
another
he
protects
and
preserves
all
why
should
we
kill
our
fellow
creatures
if
this
warfare
and
strife
be
for
the
sake
of
religion
it
is
evident
that
it
violates
the
spirit
and
basis
of
all
religion
all
the
divine
manifestations
have
proclaimed
the
oneness
of
god
and
the
unity
of
mankind
they
have
taught
that
men
should
love
and
mutually
help
each
other
in
order
that
they
might
progress
now
if
this
conception
of
religion
be
true
its
essential
principle
is
the
oneness
of
humanity
the
fundamental
truth
of
the
manifestations
is
peace
this
underlies
all
religion
all
justice
the
divine
purpose
is
that
men
should
live
in
unity
concord
and
agreement
and
should
love
one
another
consider
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
and
realize
that
the
oneness
of
humanity
is
the
primary
foundation
of
them
all
read
the
gospel
and
the
other
holy
books
you
will
find
their
fundamentals
are
one
and
the
same
therefore
unity
is
the
essential
truth
of
religion
and
when
so
understood
embraces
all
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
praise
be
to
god
this
knowledge
has
been
spread
eyes
have
been
opened
and
ears
have
become
attentive
therefore
we
must
endeavor
to
promulgate
and
practice
the
religion
of
god
which
has
been
founded
by
all
the
prophets
and
the
religion
of
god
is
absolute
love
and
unity
april
talk
at
bowery
mission
bowery
new
york
from
stenographic
notes
tonight
i
am
very
happy
for
i
have
come
here
to
meet
my
friends
i
consider
you
my
relatives
my
companions
and
i
am
your
comrade
you
must
be
thankful
to
god
that
you
are
poor
for
jesus
christ
has
said
blessed
are
the
poor
he
never
said
blessed
are
the
rich
he
said
too
that
the
kingdom
is
for
the
poor
and
that
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
enter
a
needles
eye
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
gods
kingdom
therefore
you
must
be
thankful
to
god
that
although
in
this
world
you
are
indigent
yet
the
treasures
of
god
are
within
your
reach
and
although
in
the
material
realm
you
are
poor
yet
in
the
kingdom
of
god
you
are
precious
jesus
himself
was
poor
he
did
not
belong
to
the
rich
he
passed
his
time
in
the
desert
traveling
among
the
poor
and
lived
upon
the
herbs
of
the
field
he
had
no
place
to
lay
his
head
no
home
he
was
exposed
in
the
open
to
heat
cold
and
frostto
inclement
weather
of
all
kindsyet
he
chose
this
rather
than
riches
if
riches
were
considered
a
glory
the
prophet
moses
would
have
chosen
them
jesus
would
have
been
a
rich
man
when
jesus
christ
appeared
it
was
the
poor
who
first
accepted
him
not
the
rich
therefore
you
are
the
disciples
of
jesus
christ
you
are
his
comrades
for
he
outwardly
was
poor
not
rich
even
this
earths
happiness
does
not
depend
upon
wealth
you
will
find
many
of
the
wealthy
exposed
to
dangers
and
troubled
by
difficulties
and
in
their
last
moments
upon
the
bed
of
death
there
remains
the
regret
that
they
must
be
separated
from
that
to
which
their
hearts
are
so
attached
they
come
into
this
world
naked
and
they
must
go
from
it
naked
all
they
possess
they
must
leave
behind
and
pass
away
solitary
alone
often
at
the
time
of
death
their
souls
are
filled
with
remorse
and
worst
of
all
their
hope
in
the
mercy
of
god
is
less
than
ours
praise
be
to
god
our
hope
is
in
the
mercy
of
god
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
divine
compassion
is
bestowed
upon
the
poor
jesus
christ
said
so
bahaullah
said
so
while
bahaullah
was
in
baghdad
still
in
possession
of
great
wealth
he
left
all
he
had
and
went
alone
from
the
city
living
two
years
among
the
poor
they
were
his
comrades
he
ate
with
them
slept
with
them
and
gloried
in
being
one
of
them
he
chose
for
one
of
his
names
the
title
of
the
poor
one
and
often
in
his
writings
refers
to
himself
as
darvish
which
in
persian
means
poor
and
of
this
title
he
was
very
proud
he
admonished
all
that
we
must
be
the
servants
of
the
poor
helpers
of
the
poor
remember
the
sorrows
of
the
poor
associate
with
them
for
thereby
we
may
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
god
has
not
said
that
there
are
mansions
prepared
for
us
if
we
pass
our
time
associating
with
the
rich
but
he
has
said
there
are
many
mansions
prepared
for
the
servants
of
the
poor
for
the
poor
are
very
dear
to
god
the
mercies
and
bounties
of
god
are
with
them
the
rich
are
mostly
negligent
inattentive
steeped
in
worldliness
depending
upon
their
means
whereas
the
poor
are
dependent
upon
god
and
their
reliance
is
upon
him
not
upon
themselves
therefore
the
poor
are
nearer
the
threshold
of
god
and
his
throne
jesus
was
a
poor
man
one
night
when
he
was
out
in
the
fields
the
rain
began
to
fall
he
had
no
place
to
go
for
shelter
so
he
lifted
his
eyes
toward
heaven
saying
o
father
for
the
birds
of
the
air
thou
hast
created
nests
for
the
sheep
a
fold
for
the
animals
dens
for
the
fish
places
of
refuge
but
for
me
thou
hast
provided
no
shelter
there
is
no
place
where
i
may
lay
my
head
my
bed
consists
of
the
cold
ground
my
lamps
at
night
are
the
stars
and
my
food
is
the
grass
of
the
field
yet
who
upon
earth
is
richer
than
i
for
the
greatest
blessing
thou
hast
not
given
to
the
rich
and
mighty
but
unto
me
for
thou
hast
given
me
the
poor
to
me
thou
hast
granted
this
blessing
they
are
mine
therefore
am
i
the
richest
man
on
earth
so
my
comrades
you
are
following
in
the
footsteps
of
jesus
christ
your
lives
are
similar
to
his
life
your
attitude
is
like
unto
his
you
resemble
him
more
than
the
rich
do
therefore
we
will
thank
god
that
we
have
been
so
blessed
with
real
riches
and
in
conclusion
i
ask
you
to
accept
abdulbaha
as
your
servant
at
the
end
of
this
meeting
abdulbaha

notes

h
hannen
tonight
i
am
most
happy
in
presenting
myself
before
an
audience
such
as
this
i
am
an
oriental
and
have
come
into
the
west
to
meet
the
people
of
the
occident
praise
be
to
god
upon
the
faces
of
those
assembled
here
i
perceive
the
light
of
god
this
i
consider
an
evidence
of
the
possibility
of
uniting
the
east
and
the
west
of
establishing
a
perfect
bond
between
persia
and
americaone
of
the
objects
of
this
conference
for
the
persians
there
is
no
government
better
fitted
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
their
natural
resources
and
the
helping
of
their
national
needs
in
a
reciprocal
alliance
than
the
united
states
of
america
and
for
the
americans
there
could
be
no
better
industrial
outlet
and
market
than
the
virgin
commercial
soil
of
persia
the
mineral
wealth
of
persia
is
still
latent
and
untouched
it
is
my
hope
that
the
great
american
democracy
may
be
instrumental
in
developing
these
hidden
resources
and
that
a
bond
of
perfect
amity
and
unity
may
be
established
between
the
american
republic
and
the
government
of
persia
may
this
bondwhether
material
or
spiritualbe
well
cemented
may
the
material
civilization
of
america
find
complete
efficacy
and
establishment
in
persia
and
may
the
spiritual
civilization
of
persia
find
acceptance
and
response
in
america
some
of
the
creatures
of
existence
can
live
solitary
and
alone
a
tree
for
instance
may
live
without
the
assistance
and
cooperation
of
other
trees
some
animals
are
isolated
and
lead
a
separate
existence
away
from
their
kind
but
this
is
impossible
for
man
in
his
life
and
being
cooperation
and
association
are
essential
through
association
and
meeting
we
find
happiness
and
development
individual
and
collective
for
instance
when
there
is
intercourse
and
cooperation
between
two
villages
the
advancement
of
each
will
be
assured
likewise
if
intercommunication
is
established
between
two
cities
both
will
benefit
and
progress
and
if
a
reciprocal
basis
of
agreement
be
reached
between
two
countries
their
individual
and
mutual
interests
will
find
great
development
therefore
in
the
unity
of
this
radiant
assemblage
i
behold
the
link
between
orient
and
occident
such
unity
is
the
means
and
instrument
of
cooperation
between
the
various
countries
of
the
east
and
west
it
is
evident
then
that
the
outcomes
from
this
basis
of
agreement
and
accord
are
numberless
and
unlimited
surely
there
will
be
great
harvests
of
results
forthcoming
for
persia
and
america
in
persia
advanced
material
civilization
will
be
established
and
the
doors
thrown
open
wide
to
american
commerce
above
and
beyond
all
this
a
great
love
and
fountain
of
affection
shall
bind
and
blend
these
two
remote
peoples
for
bahaullah
has
proclaimed
to
the
world
the
solidarity
of
nations
and
the
oneness
of
humanity
addressing
all
mankind
he
has
said
ye
are
all
leaves
of
one
tree
and
the
drops
of
one
sea
the
world
of
humanity
has
been
expressed
by
him
as
a
unitas
one
family
it
is
therefore
hoped
that
the
american
and
persian
nations
may
be
conjoined
and
united
in
reciprocal
love
may
they
become
one
race
endowed
with
the
same
susceptibilities
may
these
bonds
of
amity
and
accord
be
firmly
established
bahaullah
passed
forty
years
of
his
life
in
prison
and
exile
in
order
that
he
might
upraise
the
banner
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
men
for
this
he
bore
all
these
ordeals
and
difficulties
he
was
under
the
dominion
of
abdulhamid
i
too
was
in
the
prison
of
abdulhamid
until
the
committee
of
union
and
progress
hoisted
the
standard
of
liberty
and
my
fetters
were
removed
they
exhibited
great
kindness
and
love
toward
me
i
was
made
free
and
thereby
enabled
to
come
to
this
country
were
it
not
for
the
action
of
this
committee
i
should
not
be
with
you
here
tonight
therefore
you
must
all
ask
assistance
and
confirmation
in
behalf
of
this
committee
through
which
the
liberty
of
turkey
was
proclaimed
briefly
i
have
traveled
this
long
distance
crossed
the
atlantic
ocean
to
this
western
continent
in
the
desire
and
hope
that
the
strongest
bond
of
unity
may
be
established
between
america
and
persia
i
know
this
to
be
your
wish
and
purpose
also
and
am
sure
of
your
cooperation
we
shall
therefore
offer
supplication
in
the
divine
threshold
that
a
great
love
may
take
possession
of
the
hearts
of
men
and
unite
the
nations
of
the
world
we
will
pray
that
the
ensign
of
international
peace
may
be
uplifted
and
that
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
may
be
realized
and
accomplished
all
this
is
made
possible
and
practicable
through
your
efforts
may
this
american
democracy
be
the
first
nation
to
establish
the
foundation
of
international
agreement
may
it
be
the
first
nation
to
proclaim
the
universality
of
mankind
may
it
be
the
first
to
upraise
the
standard
of
the
most
great
peace
and
through
this
nation
of
democracy
may
these
philanthropic
intentions
and
institutions
be
spread
broadcast
throughout
the
world
truly
this
is
a
great
and
revered
nation
here
liberty
has
reached
its
highest
degree
the
intentions
of
its
people
are
most
praiseworthy
they
are
indeed
worthy
of
being
the
first
to
build
the
tabernacle
of
the
most
great
peace
and
proclaim
the
oneness
of
mankind
i
will
supplicate

for

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
i
have
come
here
to
visit
you
with
the
greatest
longing
i
have
wished
to
see
you
realizing
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
you
could
come
to
me
and
that
very
few
could
make
the
trip
i
decided
to
come
to
you
so
that
all
might
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
praise
be
to
god
i
am
here
and
i
am
looking
into
your
facesfaces
radiant
with
inner
beauty
hearts
attracted
to
the
kingdom
of
abha
spirits
exhilarated
through
the
glad
tidings
of
god
therefore
i
have
experienced
the
greatest
possible
happiness
and
surely
this
happiness
must
be
mutual
for
the
hearts
are
connected
with
each
other
and
are
filled
with
the
same
vibration
the
flame
and
the
light
of
love
are
reflected
in
all
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
heart
longings
fill
every
heart
if
we
should
offer
a
hundred
thousand
thanksgivings
every
moment
to
the
threshold
of
god
for
this
love
which
has
blended
the
orient
and
occident
we
would
fail
to
express
our
gratitude
sufficiently
if
all
the
powers
of
earth
should
seek
to
bring
about
this
love
between
east
and
west
they
would
prove
incapable
if
they
wished
to
establish
this
unity
it
would
prove
impossible
but
bahaullah
has
accomplished
both
through
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
and
this
bond
of
unity
through
love
is
indissoluble
it
shall
continue
unto
time
everlasting
and
day
by
day
its
power
shall
increase
erelong
it
shall
enchain
the
world
and
eventually
the
hearts
of
all
the
nations
of
the
world
will
be
brought
together
by
its
constraining
clasp
the
world
of
humanity
shall
become
the
manifestation
of
the
lights
of
divinity
and
the
bestowals
of
god
shall
surround
all
from
the
standpoints
of
both
material
and
spiritual
civilization
extraordinary
progress
and
development
will
be
witnessed
in
this
present
cycle
there
will
be
an
evolution
in
civilization
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
world
of
humanity
has
heretofore
been
in
the
stage
of
infancy
now
it
is
approaching
maturity
just
as
the
individual
human
organism
having
attained
the
period
of
maturity
reaches
its
fullest
degree
of
physical
strength
and
ripened
intellectual
faculties
so
that
in
one
year
of
this
ripened
period
there
is
witnessed
an
unprecedented
measure
of
development
likewise
the
world
of
humanity
in
this
cycle
of
its
completeness
and
consummation
will
realize
an
immeasurable
upward
progress
and
that
power
of
accomplishment
whereof
each
individual
human
reality
is
the
depository
of
godthat
outworking
universal
spiritlike
the
intellectual
faculty
will
reveal
itself
in
infinite
degrees
of
perfection
therefore
thank
ye
god
that
ye
have
come
into
the
plane
of
existence
in
this
radiant
century
wherein
the
bestowals
of
god
are
appearing
from
all
directions
when
the
doors
of
the
kingdom
have
been
opened
unto

has
grown
and
developed
in
material
civilization
may
be
quickened
in
the
bringing
forth
of
spiritual
ideals
just
as
human
intellects
have
revealed
the
secrets

matter
and
have
brought
forth
from
the
realm
of
the
invisible
the
mysteries
of
nature
may

into
the

the
paradise
of
abha
the
standard
of
the
most
great
peace
will
be
borne
aloft
and
the
oneness
of

talk
at
universalist

thirteenth

l
streets
washington
dc
notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
the
doctrines
and
creed
of
this
church
so
capably
expressed
by
its
revered
minister
are
truly
commendable
sanctified
and
worthy
of
praise
and
glorification
for
these
precepts
are
opposed
to
the
deeprooted
religious
prejudices
of
the
day
it
is
evident
that
prejudices
arising
from
adherence
to
religious
forms
and
imitation
of
ancestral
beliefs
have
hindered
the
progress
of
humanity
thousands
of
years
how
many
wars
and
battles
have
been
fought
how
much
division
discord
and
hatred
have
been
caused
by
this
form
of
prejudice
but
inasmuch
as
this
century
is
a
century
of
the
revelation
of
realitypraise
be
to
godthe
thoughts
of
men
are
being
directed
toward
the
welfare
and
unity
of
humanity
daily
the
mirage
of
imitations
is
passing
away
and
the
ocean
of
truth
is
surging
more
tumultuously
all
the
existing
nations
had
a
divine
foundation
of
truth
or
reality
originally
which
was
intended
to
be
conducive
to
the
unity
and
accord
of
mankind
but
the
light
of
that
reality
gradually
became
obscured
the
darkness
of
superstitions
and
imitations
came
and
took
its
place
binding
the
world
of
humanity
in
the
chains
and
fetters
of
ignorance
enmity
arose
among
men
increasing
to
such
an
extent
that
nation
strove
against
nation
in
hatred
and
violence
war
has
been
a
religious
and
political
human
heritage
now
it
is
enough
we
must
investigate
reality
we
must
put
away
these
superstitions
it
is
a
selfevident
truth
that
all
humanity
is
the
creation
of
god
all
are
his
servants
and
under
his
protection
all
are
recipients
of
his
bestowals
god
is
kind
to
all
his
servants
at
most
it
is
this
that
some
are
ignorant
they
must
be
educated
in
order
that
they
may
become
intelligent
some
are
immature
as
children
they
must
be
aided
and
assisted
in
order
that
they
may
become
mature
some
are
sick
and
ailing
they
must
be
healed
but
the
suffering
patient
must
not
be
tested
by
false
treatment
the
child
must
not
be
warped
and
hindered
in
its
development
the
ignorant
must
not
be
restricted
by
censure
and
criticism
we
must
look
for
the
real
true
remedy
all
the
prophets
of
god
including
jesus
christ
appeared
in
the
world
for
the
education
of
humanity
to
develop
immature
souls
into
maturity
to
transform
the
ignorant
of
mankind
into
the
knowing
thereby
establishing
love
and
unity
through
divine
education
and
training
the
prophets
have
not
come
to
cause
discord
and
enmity
for
god
has
wished
all
good
for
his
servants
and
he
who
wishes
the
servants
of
god
evil
is
against
god
he
has
not
obeyed
the
will
and
emulated
the
example
of
god
he
has
followed
satanic
leadings
and
footprints
the
attributes
of
god
are
love
and
mercy
the
attribute
of
satan
is
hate
therefore
he
who
is
merciful
and
kind
to
his
fellowmen
is
manifesting
the
divine
attribute
and
he
who
is
hating
and
hostile
toward
a
fellow
creature
is
satanic
god
is
absolute
love
even
as
jesus
christ
has
declared
and
satan
is
utter
hatred
wherever
love
is
witnessed
know
that
there
is
a
manifestation
of
gods
mercy
whenever
you
meet
hatred
and
enmity
know
that
these
are
the
evidences
and
attributes
of
satan
the
prophets
have
appeared
in
this
world
with
the
mission
that
human
souls
may
become
the
expressions
of
the
merciful
that
they
may
be
educated
and
developed
attain
to
love
and
amity
and
establish
peace
and
agreement
in
the
world
of
existence
the
animal
is
a
captive
of
nature
its
actions
are
according
to
the
exigencies
and
requirements
of
nature
it
has
no
consideration
or
consciousness
of
good
and
evil
it
simply
follows
its
natural
instinct
and
inclination
the
prophets
of
god
have
come
to
show
man
the
way
of
righteousness
in
order
that
he
may
not
follow
his
own
natural
impulse
but
govern
his
action
by
the
light
of
their
precept
and
example
according
to
their
teachings
he
should
do
that
which
is
found
to
be
praiseworthy
by
the
standard
of
reason
and
judgment
of
intellect
even
though
it
be
opposed
to
his
natural
human
inclination
and
he
should
not
do
that
which
is
found
to
be
unworthy
by
that
same
standard
even
though
it
be
in
the
direction
of
his
natural
impulse
and
desire
therefore
man
must
follow
and
manifest
the
attributes
of
the
merciful
the
imperfect
members
of
society
the
weak
souls
in
humanity
follow
their
natural
trend
their
lives
and
actions
are
in
accord
with
their
natural
propensities
they
are
captives
of
physical
susceptibilities
they
are
not
in
touch
or
in
tune
with
the
spiritual
bounties
man
has
two
aspects
the
physical
which
is
subject
to
nature
and
the
merciful
or
divine
which
is
connected
with
god
if
the
physical
or
natural
disposition
in
him
should
overcome
the
heavenly
and
merciful
he
is
then
the
most
degraded
of
animal
beings
and
if
the
divine
and
spiritual
should
triumph
over
the
human
and
natural
he
is
verily
an
angel
the
prophets
come
into
the
world
to
guide
and
educate
humanity
so
that
the
animal
nature
of
man
may
disappear
and
the
divinity
of
his
powers
become
awakened
the
divine
aspect
or
spiritual
nature
consists
of
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
the
second
birth
of
which
jesus
has
spoken
refers
to
the
appearance
of
this
heavenly
nature
in
man
it
is
expressed
in
the
baptism
of
the
holy
spirit
and
he
who
is
baptized
by
the
holy
spirit
is
a
veritable
manifestation
of
divine
mercy
to
mankind
then
he
becomes
just
and
kind
to
all
humanity
he
entertains
prejudice
and
ill
will
toward
none
he
shuns
no
nation
or
people
the
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
are
one
if
we
investigate
these
foundations
we
discover
much
ground
for
agreement
but
if
we
consider
the
imitations
of
forms
and
ancestral
beliefs
we
find
points
of
disagreement
and
division
for
these
imitations
differ
while
the
sources
and
foundations
are
one
and
the
same
that
is
to
say
the
fundamentals
are
conducive
to
unity
but
imitations
are
the
cause
of
disunion
and
dismemberment
whosoever
is
lacking
in
love
for
humanity
or
manifests
hatred
and
bigotry
toward
any
part
of
it
violates
the
foundation
and
source
of
his
own
belief
and
is
holding
to
forms
and
imitations
jesus
christ
declares
that
the
sun
rises
upon
the
evil
and
the
good
and
the
rain
descends
upon
the
just
and
the
unjustupon
all
humanity
alike
christ
was
a
divine
mercy
which
shone
upon
all
mankind
the
medium
for
the
descent
of
the
bounty
of
god
and
the
bounty
of
god
is
transcendent
unrestricted
universal
the
revered
minister
read
from
the
words
of
the
gospel
i
have
yet
many
things
to
say
unto
you
but
ye
cannot
bear
them
now
howbeit
when
he
the
spirit
of
truth
is
come
he
will
guide
you
into
all
truth
the
century
has
dawned
when
the
spirit
of
truth
can
reveal
these
verities
to
mankind
proclaim
that
very
word
establish
the
real
foundations
of
christianity
and
deliver
the
nations
and
peoples
from
the
bondage
of
forms
and
imitations
the
cause
of
discord
prejudice
and
animosity
will
be
removed
the
basis
of
love
and
amity
be
established
therefore
all
of
you
must
strive
with
heart
and
soul
in
order
that
enmity
may
disappear
entirely
and
that
strife
and
hatred
pass
away
absolutely
from
the
midst
of
the
human
world
you
must
listen
to
the
admonition
of
this
spirit
of
truth
you
must
follow
the
example
and
footprints
of
jesus
christ
read
the
gospels
jesus
christ
was
mercy
itself
was
love
itself
he
even
prayed
in
behalf
of
his
executionersfor
those
who
crucified
himsaying
father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
if
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
they
would
not
have
done
it
consider
how
kind
jesus
christ
was
that
even
upon
the
cross
he
prayed
for
his
oppressors
we
must
follow
his
example
we
must
emulate
the
prophets
of
god
we
must
follow
jesus
christ
we
must
free
ourselves
from
all
these
imitations
which
are
the
source
of
darkness
in
the
world
i
shall
ask
you
a
question
did
god
create
us
for
love
or
for
enmity
did
he
create
us
for
peace
or
discord
surely
he
has
created
us
for
love
therefore
we
should
live
in
accordance
with
his
will
do
not
listen
to
anything
that
is
prejudiced
for
selfinterest
prompts
men
to
be
prejudiced
they
are
thoughtful
only
of
their
own
will
and
purposes
they
live
and
move
in
darkness
consider
how
many
different
nations
and
divergent
religious
beliefs
existed
when
christ
appeared
enmity
and
strife
prevailed
among
themromans
greeks
assyrians
egyptiansall
warring
and
hostile
toward
each
other
christ
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
united
them
established
fellowship
among
them
so
that
no
trace
of
strife
remained
under
his
standard
they
became
united
and
lived
in
peace
through
his
teachings
which
is
preferable
and
more
commendable
to
follow
the
example
of
jesus
christ
or
to
manifest
the
satanic
instinct
let
us
strive
with
all
our
powers
to
unite
the
east
and
west
so
that
the
nations
of
the
world
may
be
advanced
and
that
all
may
live
according
to
the
one
foundation
of
the
religions
of
god
the
essentials
of
the
divine
religion
are
one
reality
indivisible
and
not
multiple
it
is
one
and
when
through
investigation
we
find
it
to
be
single
we
have
a
basis
for
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
i
will
pray
for
you
asking
confirmation
and
assistance
in
your
behalf

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
see
how
good
bahaullah
is
to
us
how
great
the
power
of
his
word
from
what
distant
parts
of
the
world
he
has
brought
us
together
in
this
house
and
caused
us
to
meet
at
this
heavenly
table
for
love
has
prepared
a
feast
and
bidden
abdulbaha
to
let
this
entertainment
be
in
his
name
what
a
union
of
hearts
and
what
a
confirmation
of
bahaullah
between
east
and
west
has
been
established
how
his
bounty
has
embraced
all
how
his
favors
have
been
perfected
for
all
when
the
muslims
conquered
persia
the
chief
of
the
zoroastrian
high
priests
went
to
drink
wine
according
to
muslim
law
wine
is
forbidden
and
he
who
drinks
it
must
be
punished
by
eightyone
strokes
of
the
whip
therefore
the
muslims
arrested
the
high
priest
and
whipped
him
at
that
time
the
arabs
were
considered
very
low
and
degraded
by
the
persians
scarcely
to
be
accounted
as
human
beings
as
muhammad
was
an
arab
the
persians
looked
upon
him
with
disdain
but
when
the
high
priest
saw
the
evidences
of
a
power
in
muhammad
which
controlled
these
despised
people
he
cried
out
o
thou
arabian
muhammad
what
hast
thou
done
what
hast
thou
done
which
has
made
thy
people
arrest
the
chief
high
priest
of
the
zoroastrians
for
committing
something
unlawful
in
thy
religion
by
this
circumstance
the
prejudice
which
caused
the
zoroastrian
to
shun
the
muslim
had
been
overcome
for
he
recognized
in
what
had
happened
to
him
the
great
influence
muhammad
exercised
over
these
people
today
in
this
meeting
we
have
an
evidence
of
how
bahaullah
through
the
power
of
the
love
of
god
has
exercised
a
wonderful
spiritual
influence
throughout
the
world
from
the
remotest
parts
of
persia
and
the
orient
he
has
caused
men
to
come
to
this
table
to
meet
with
the
people
of
the
west
in
the
utmost
love
and
affection
union
and
harmony
behold
how
the
power
of
bahaullah
has
brought
the
east
and
west
together
and
abdulbaha
is
standing
serving
you
there
is
neither
rod
nor
blow
whip
nor
sword
but
the
power
of
the
love
of
god
has
accomplished
this
in
this
world
we
judge
a
cause
or
movement
by
its
progress
and
development
some
movements
appear
manifest
a
brief
period
of
activity
then
discontinue
others
show
forth
a
greater
measure
of
growth
and
strength
but
before
attaining
mature
development
weaken
disintegrate
and
are
lost
in
oblivion
neither
of
these
mentioned
are
progressive
and
permanent
there
is
still
another
kind
of
movement
or
cause
which
from
a
very
small
inconspicuous
beginning
goes
forward
with
sure
and
steady
progress
gradually
broadening
and
widening
until
it
has
assumed
universal
dimensions
the
bahai
movement
is
of
this
nature
for
instance
when
bahaullah
was
exiled
from
persia
with
abdulbaha
and
the
rest
of
his
family
they
traveled
the
long
road
from
tihran
to
baghdad
passing
through
many
towns
and
villages
during
the
whole
of
that
journey
and
distance
they
did
not
meet
a
single
believer
in
the
cause
for
which
they
had
been
banished
at
that
time
very
little
was
known
about
it
in
any
part
of
the
world
even
in
baghdad
there
was
but
one
believer
who
had
been
taught
by
bahaullah
himself
in
persia
later
on
two
or
three
others
appeared
you
will
see
therefore
that
at
the
beginning
the
cause
of
bahaullah
was
almost
unknown
but
on
account
of
being
a
divine
movement
it
grew
and
developed
with
irresistible
spiritual
power
until
in
this
day
wherever
you
traveleast
or
westand
in
whatever
country
you
journey
you
will
meet
bahai
assemblies
and
institutions
this
is
an
evidence
that
the
bahais
are
spreading
the
blessings

today
i
am
most
happy
for
i
see
here
a
gathering
of
the
servants
of
god
i
see
white
and
black
sitting
together
there
are
no
whites
and
blacks
before
god
all
colors
are
one
and
that
is
the
color
of
servitude
to
god
scent
and
color
are
not
important
the
heart
is
important
if
the
heart
is
pure
white
or
black
or
any
color
makes
no
difference
god
does
not
look
at
colors
he
looks
at
the
hearts
he
whose
heart
is
pure
is
better
he
whose
character
is
better
is
more
pleasing
he
who
turns
more
to
the
abha
kingdom
is
more
advanced
in
the
realm
of
existence
colors
are
of
no
importance
observe
in
the
mineral
kingdom
colors
are
not
the
cause
of
discord
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
the
colors
of
multicolored
flowers
are
not
the
cause
of
discord
rather
colors
are
the
cause
of
the
adornment
of
the
garden
because
a
single
color
has
no
appeal
but
when
you
observe
manycolored
flowers
there
is
charm
and
display
the
world
of
humanity
too
is
like
a
garden
and
humankind
are
like
the
manycolored
flowers
therefore
different
colors
constitute
an
adornment
in
the
same
way
there
are
many
colors
in
the
realm
of
animals
doves
are
of
many
colors
nevertheless
they
live
in
utmost
harmony
they
never
look
at
color
instead
they
look
at
the
species
how
often
white
doves
fly
with
black
ones
in
the
same
way
other
birds
and
varicolored
animals
never
look
at
color
they
look
at
the
species
now
ponder
this
animals
despite
the
fact
that
they
lack
reason
and
understanding
do
not
make
colors
the
cause
of
conflict
why
should
man
who
has
reason
create
conflict
this
is
wholly
unworthy
of
him
especially
white
and
black
are
the
descendants
of
the
same
adam
they
belong
to
one
household
in
origin
they
were
one
they
were
the
same
color
adam
was
of
one
color
eve
had
one
color
all
humanity
is
descended
from
them
therefore
in
origin
they
are
one
these
colors
developed
later
due
to
climates
and
regions
they
have
no
significance
whatsoever
therefore
today
i
am
very
happy
that
white
and
black
have
gathered
together
in
this
meeting
i
hope
this
coming
together
and
harmony
reaches
such
a
degree
that
no
distinctions
shall
remain
between
them
and
they
shall
be
together
in
the
utmost
harmony
and
love
but
i
wish
to
say
one
thing
in
order
that
the
blacks
may
become
grateful
to
the
whites
and
the
whites
become
loving
toward
the
blacks
if
you
go
to
africa
and
see
the
blacks
of
africa
you
will
realize
how
much
progress
you
have
made
praise
be
to
god
you
are
like
the
whites
there
are
no
great
distinctions
left
but
the
blacks
of
africa
are
treated
as
servants
the
first
proclamation
of
emancipation
for
the
blacks
was
made
by
the
whites
of
america
how
they
fought
and
sacrificed
until
they
freed
the
blacks
then
it
spread
to
other
places
the
blacks
of
africa
were
in
complete
bondage
but
your
emancipation
led
to
their
freedom
alsothat
is
the
european
states
emulated
the
americans
and
the
emancipation
proclamation
became
universal
it
was
for
your
sake
that
the
whites
of
america
made
such
an
effort
were
it
not
for
this
effort
universal
emancipation
would
not
have
been
proclaimed
therefore
you
must
be
very
grateful
to
the
whites
of
america
and
the
whites
must
become
very
loving
toward
you
so
that
you
may
progress
in
all
human
grades
strive
jointly
to
make
extraordinary
progress
and
mix
together
completely
in
short
you
must
be
very
thankful
to
the
whites
who
were
the
cause
of
your
freedom
in
america
had
you
not
been
freed
other
blacks
would
not
have
been
freed
either
nowpraise
be
to
godeveryone
is
free
and
lives
in
tranquillity
i
pray
that
you
attain
to
such
a
degree
of
good
character
and
behavior
that
the
names
of
black
and
white
shall
vanish
all
shall
be
called
human
just
as
the
name
for
a
flight
of
doves
is
dove
they
are
not
called
black
and
white
likewise
with
other
birds
i
hope
that
you
attain
to
such
a
high
degreeand
this
is
impossible
except
through
love
you
must
try
to
create
love
between
yourselves
and
this
love
does
not
come
about
unless
you
are
grateful
to
the
whites
and
the
whites
are
loving
toward
you
and
endeavor
to
promote
your
advancement
and
enhance
your
honor
this
will
be
the
cause
of
love
differences
between
black
and
white
will
be
completely
obliterated
indeed
ethnic
and
national
differences
will
all
disappear
i
am
very
happy
to
see
you
and
thank
god
that
this
meeting
is
composed
of
people
of
both
races
and
that
both
are
gathered
in
perfect
love
and
harmony
i
hope
this
becomes
the
example
of
universal
harmony
and
love
until
no
title
remains
except
that
of
humanity
such
a
title
demonstrates
the
perfection
of
the
human
world
and
is
the
cause
of
eternal
glory
and
human
happiness
i
pray
that
you
be
with
one
another
in
utmost
harmony
and
love
and
strive
to
enable
each
other
to
live
in
comfort

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
today
i
have
been
speaking
from
dawn
until
now
yet
because
of
love
fellowship
and
desire
to
be
with
you
i
have
come
here
to
speak
again
briefly
within
the
last
few
days
a
terrible
event
has
happened
in
the
world
an
event
saddening
to
every
heart
and
grieving
every
spirit
i
refer
to
the
titanic
disaster
in
which
many
of
our
fellow
human
beings
were
drowned
a
number
of
beautiful
souls
passed
beyond
this
earthly
life
although
such
an
event
is
indeed
regrettable
we
must
realize
that
everything
which
happens
is
due
to
some
wisdom
and
that
nothing
happens
without
a
reason
therein
is
a
mystery
but
whatever
the
reason
and
mystery
it
was
a
very
sad
occurrence
one
which
brought
tears
to
many
eyes
and
distress
to
many
souls
i
was
greatly
affected
by
this
disaster
some
of
those
who
were
lost
voyaged
on
the
cedric
with
us
as
far
as
naples
and
afterward
sailed
upon
the
other
ship
when
i
think
of
them
i
am
very
sad
indeed
but
when
i
consider
this
calamity
in
another
aspect
i
am
consoled
by
the
realization
that
the
worlds
of
god
are
infinite
that
though
they
were
deprived
of
this
existence
they
have
other
opportunities
in
the
life
beyond
even
as
christ
has
said
in
my
fathers
house
are
many
mansions
they
were
called
away
from
the
temporary
and
transferred
to
the
eternal
they
abandoned
this
material
existence
and
entered
the
portals
of
the
spiritual
world
foregoing
the
pleasures
and
comforts
of
the
earthly
they
now
partake
of
a
joy
and
happiness
far
more
abiding
and
real
for
they
have
hastened
to
the
kingdom
of
god
the
mercy
of
god
is
infinite
and
it
is
our
duty
to
remember
these
departed
souls
in
our
prayers
and
supplications
that
they
may
draw
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
source
itself
these
human
conditions
may
be
likened
to
the
matrix
of
the
mother
from
which
a
child
is
to
be
born
into
the
spacious
outer
world
at
first
the
infant
finds
it
very
difficult
to
reconcile
itself
to
its
new
existence
it
cries
as
if
not
wishing
to
be
separated
from
its
narrow
abode
and
imagining
that
life
is
restricted
to
that
limited
space
it
is
reluctant
to
leave
its
home
but
nature
forces
it
into
this
world
having
come
into
its
new
conditions
it
finds
that
it
has
passed
from
darkness
into
a
sphere
of
radiance
from
gloomy
and
restricted
surroundings
it
has
been
transferred
to
a
spacious
and
delightful
environment
its
nourishment
was
the
blood
of
the
mother
now
it
finds
delicious
food
to
enjoy
its
new
life
is
filled
with
brightness
and
beauty
it
looks
with
wonder
and
delight
upon
the
mountains
meadows
and
fields
of
green
the
rivers
and
fountains
the
wonderful
stars
it
breathes
the
lifequickening
atmosphere
and
then
it
praises
god
for
its
release
from
the
confinement
of
its
former
condition
and
attainment
to
the
freedom
of
a
new
realm
this
analogy
expresses
the
relation
of
the
temporal
world
to
the
life
hereafterthe
transition
of
the
soul
of
man
from
darkness
and
uncertainty
to
the
light
and
reality
of
the
eternal
kingdom
at
first
it
is
very
difficult
to
welcome
death
but
after
attaining
its
new
condition
the
soul
is
grateful
for
it
has
been
released
from
the
bondage
of
the
limited
to
enjoy
the
liberties
of
the
unlimited
it
has
been
freed
from
a
world
of
sorrow
grief
and
trials
to
live
in
a
world
of
unending
bliss
and
joy
the
phenomenal
and
physical
have
been
abandoned
in
order
that
it
may
attain
the
opportunities
of
the
ideal
and
spiritual
therefore
the
souls
of
those
who
have
passed
away
from
earth
and
completed
their
span
of
mortal
pilgrimage
in
the
titanic
disaster
have
hastened
to
a
world
superior
to
this
they
have
soared
away
from
these
conditions
of
darkness
and
dim
vision
into
the
realm
of
light
these
are
the
only
considerations
which
can
comfort
and
console
those
whom
they
have
left
behind
furthermore
these
events
have
deeper
reasons
their
object
and
purpose
is
to
teach
man
certain
lessons
we
are
living
in
a
day
of
reliance
upon
material
conditions
men
imagine
that
the
great
size
and
strength
of
a
ship
the
perfection
of
machinery
or
the
skill
of
a
navigator
will
ensure
safety
but
these
disasters
sometimes
take
place
that
men
may
know
that
god
is
the
real
protector
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
to
protect
man
a
little
ship
may
escape
destruction
whereas
the
greatest
and
most
perfectly
constructed
vessel
with
the
best
and
most
skillful
navigator
may
not
survive
a
danger
such
as
was
present
on
the
ocean
the
purpose
is
that
the
people
of
the
world
may
turn
to
god
the
one
protector
that
human
souls
may
rely
upon
his
preservation
and
know
that
he
is
the
real
safety
these
events
happen
in
order
that
mans
faith
may
be
increased
and
strengthened
therefore
although
we
feel
sad
and
disheartened
we
must
supplicate
god
to
turn
our
hearts
to
the
kingdom
and
pray
for
these
departed
souls
with
faith
in
his
infinite
mercy
so
that
although
they
have
been
deprived
of
this
earthly
life
they
may
enjoy
a
new
existence
in
the
supreme
mansions
of
the
heavenly
father
let
no
one
imagine
that
these
words
imply
that
man
should
not
be
thorough
and
careful
in
his
undertakings
god
has
endowed
man
with
intelligence
so
that
he
may
safeguard
and
protect
himself
therefore
he
must
provide
and
surround
himself
with
all
that
scientific
skill
can
produce
he
must
be
deliberate
thoughtful
and
thorough
in
his
purposes
build
the
best
ship
and
provide
the
most
experienced
captain
yet
withal
let
him
rely
upon
god
and
consider
god
as
the
one
keeper
if
god
protects
nothing
can
imperil
mans
safety
and
if
it
be
not
his
will
to
safeguard
no
amount
of
preparation
and
precaution
will
avail

notes
by
joseph

hannen
as
i
stand
here
tonight
and
look
upon
this
assembly
i
am
reminded
curiously
of
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
violets
gathered
together
in
varying
colors
dark
and
light
this
is
an
evidence
and
indication
that
the
united
states
of
america
is
a
just
and
free
government
for
i
see
black
and
white
seated
together
in
perfect
harmony
and
agreement
hearts
are
united
this
just
government
makes
such
a
meeting
possible
you
should
thank
god
continually
that
you
enjoy
the
security
and
protection
of
a
government
which
furthers
your
development
and
rules
with
impartial
equity
and
equality
toward
all
even
as
a
father
for
in
the
human
world
there
is
no
greater
blessing
this
evening
i
will
speak
to
you
upon
scientific
subjects
the
virtues
of
humanity
are
many
but
science
is
the
most
noble
of
them
all
the
distinction
which
man
enjoys
above
and
beyond
the
station
of
the
animal
is
due
to
this
paramount
virtue
it
is
a
bestowal
of
god
it
is
not
material
it
is
divine
science
is
an
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
the
power
of
investigating
and
discovering
the
verities
of
the
universe
the
means
by
which
man
finds
a
pathway
to
god
all
the
powers
and
attributes
of
man
are
human
and
hereditary
in
originoutcomes
of
natures
processesexcept
the
intellect
which
is
supernatural
through
intellectual
and
intelligent
inquiry
science
is
the
discoverer
of
all
things
it
unites
present
and
past
reveals
the
history
of
bygone
nations
and
events
and
confers
upon
man
today
the
essence
of
all
human
knowledge
and
attainment
throughout
the
ages
by
intellectual
processes
and
logical
deductions
of
reason
this
superpower
in
man
can
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
future
and
anticipate
its
happenings
science
is
the
first
emanation
from
god
toward
man
all
created
beings
embody
the
potentiality
of
material
perfection
but
the
power
of
intellectual
investigation
and
scientific
acquisition
is
a
higher
virtue
specialized
to
man
alone
other
beings
and
organisms
are
deprived
of
this
potentiality
and
attainment
god
has
created
or
deposited
this
love
of
reality
in
man
the
development
and
progress
of
a
nation
is
according
to
the
measure
and
degree
of
that
nations
scientific
attainments
through
this
means
its
greatness
is
continually
increased
and
day
by
day
the
welfare
and
prosperity
of
its
people
are
assured
all
blessings
are
divine
in
origin
but
none
can
be
compared
with
this
power
of
intellectual
investigation
and
research
which
is
an
eternal
gift
producing
fruits
of
unending
delight
man
is
ever
partaking
of
these
fruits
all
other
blessings
are
temporary
this
is
an
everlasting
possession
even
sovereignty
has
its
limitations
and
overthrow
this
is
a
kingship
and
dominion
which
none
may
usurp
or
destroy
briefly
it
is
an
eternal
blessing
and
divine
bestowal
the
supreme
gift
of
god
to
man
therefore
you
should
put
forward
your
most
earnest
efforts
toward
the
acquisition
of
science
and
arts
the
greater
your
attainment
the
higher
your
standard
in
the
divine
purpose
the
man
of
science
is
perceiving
and
endowed
with
vision
whereas
he
who
is
ignorant
and
neglectful
of
this
development
is
blind
the
investigating
mind
is
attentive
alive
the
callous
and
indifferent
mind
is
deaf
and
dead
a
scientific
man
is
a
true
index
and
representative
of
humanity
for
through
processes
of
inductive
reasoning
and
research
he
is
informed
of
all
that
appertains
to
humanity
its
status
conditions
and
happenings
he
studies
the
human
body
politic
understands
social
problems
and
weaves
the
web
and
texture
of
civilization
in
fact
science
may
be
likened
to
a
mirror
wherein
the
infinite
forms
and
images
of
existing
things
are
revealed
and
reflected
it
is
the
very
foundation
of
all
individual
and
national
development
without
this
basis
of
investigation
development
is
impossible
therefore
seek
with
diligent
endeavor
the
knowledge
and
attainment
of
all
that
lies
within
the
power
of
this
wonderful
bestowal
we
have
already
stated
that
science
or
the
attribute
of
scientific
penetration
is
supernatural
and
that
all
other
blessings
of
god
are
within
the
boundary
of
nature
what
is
the
proof
of
this
all
created
things
except
man
are
captives
of
nature
the
stars
and
suns
swinging
through
infinite
space
all
earthly
forms
of
life
and
existencewhether
mineral
vegetable
or
animalcome
under
the
dominion
and
control
of
natural
law
man
through
scientific
knowledge
and
power
rules
nature
and
utilizes
her
laws
to
do
his
bidding
according
to
natural
limitations
he
is
a
creature
of
earth
restricted
to
life
upon
its
surface
but
through
scientific
utilization
of
material
laws
he
soars
in
the
sky
sails
upon
the
ocean
and
dives
beneath
it
the
products
of
his
invention
and
discovery
so
familiar
to
us
in
daily
life
were
once
mysteries
of
nature
for
instance
man
has
brought
electricity
out
of
the
plane
of
the
invisible
into
the
plane
of
the
visible
harnessed
and
imprisoned
that
mysterious
natural
agent
and
made
it
the
servant
of
his
needs
and
wishes
similar
instances
are
many
but
we
will
not
prolong
this
man
as
it
were
takes
the
sword
out
of
natures
hand
and
with
it
for
his
scepter
of
authority
dominates
nature
itself
nature
is
without
the
crown
of
human
faculties
and
attributes
man
possesses
conscious
intelligence
and
reflection
nature
does
not
this
is
an
established
fundamental
among
philosophers
man
is
endowed
with
volition
and
memory
nature
has
neither
man
can
seek
out
the
mysteries
latent
in
nature
whereas
nature
is
not
conscious
of
her
own
hidden
phenomena
man
is
progressive
nature
is
stationary
without
the
power
of
progression
or
retrogression
man
is
endowed
with
ideal
virtuesfor
example
intellection
volition
faith
confession
and
acknowledgment
of
godwhile
nature
is
devoid
of
all
these
the
ideal
faculties
of
man
including
the
capacity
for
scientific
acquisition
are
beyond
natures
ken
these
are
powers
whereby
man
is
differentiated
and
distinguished
from
all
other
forms
of
life
this
is
the
bestowal
of
divine
idealism
the
crown
adorning
human
heads
notwithstanding
the
gift
of
this
supernatural
power
it
is
most
amazing
that
materialists
still
consider
themselves
within
the
bonds
and
captivity
of
nature
the
truth
is
that
god
has
endowed
man
with
virtues
powers
and
ideal
faculties
of
which
nature
is
entirely
bereft
and
by
which
man
is
elevated
distinguished
and
superior
we
must
thank
god
for
these
bestowals
for
these
powers
he
has
given
us
for
this
crown
he
has
placed
upon
our
heads
how
shall
we
utilize
these
gifts
and
expend
these
bounties
by
directing
our
efforts
toward
the
unification
of
the
human
race
we
must
use
these
powers
in
establishing
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
appreciate
these
virtues
by
accomplishing
the
unity
of
whites
and
blacks
devote
this
divine
intelligence
to
the
perfecting
of
amity
and
accord
among
all
branches
of
the
human
family
so
that
under
the
protection
and
providence
of
god
the
east
and
west
may
hold
each
others
hands
and
become
as
lovers
then
will
mankind
be
as
one
nation
one
race
and
kindas
waves
of
one
ocean
although
these
waves
may
differ
in
form
and
shape
they
are
waves
of
the
same
sea
flowers
may
be
variegated
in
colors
but
they
are
all
flowers
of
one
garden
trees
differ
though
they
grow
in
the
same
orchard
all
are
nourished
and
quickened
into
life
by
the
bounty
of
the
same
rain
all
grow
and
develop
by
the
heat
and
light
of
the
one
sun
all
are
refreshed
and
exhilarated
by
the
same
breeze
that
they
may
bring
forth
varied
fruits
this
is
according
to
the
creative
wisdom
if
all
trees
bore
the
same
kind
of
fruit
it
would
cease
to
be
delicious
in
their
neverending
variety
man
finds
enjoyment
instead
of
monotony
and
now
as
i
look
into
your
faces
i
am
reminded
of
trees
varying
in
color
and
form
but
all
bearing
luscious
and
delectable
fruits
fragrant
and
delightful
to
the
inner
and
outer
senses
the
radiance
and
spirituality
of
this
meeting
is
through
the
favor
of
god
our
hearts
are
uplifted
in
thankfulness
to
him
praise
be
to
god
you
are
living
upon
the
great
continent
of
the
west
enjoying
the
perfect
liberty
security
and
peace
of
this
just
government

is
no
cause
for
sorrow
or
unhappiness
anywhere
every
means
of
happiness
and
enjoyment
is
about
you
for
in
this
human
world
there
is
no
greater
blessing

you
do
not
know
i
who
for
forty
years
have

a
greater

are
the
great
bestowals
of

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
what
a
wonderful
meeting
this
is
these
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
the
song
we
have
just
listened
to
was
very
beautiful
in
melody
and
words
the
art
of
music
is
divine
and
effective
it
is
the
food
of
the
soul
and
spirit
through
the
power
and
charm
of
music
the
spirit
of
man
is
uplifted
it
has
wonderful
sway
and
effect
in
the
hearts
of
children
for
their
hearts
are
pure
and
melodies
have
great
influence
in
them
the
latent
talents
with
which
the
hearts
of
these
children
are
endowed
will
find
expression
through
the
medium
of
music
therefore
you
must
exert
yourselves
to
make
them
proficient
teach
them
to
sing
with
excellence
and
effect
it
is
incumbent
upon
each
child
to
know
something
of
music
for
without
knowledge
of
this
art
the
melodies
of
instrument
and
voice
cannot
be
rightly
enjoyed
likewise
it
is
necessary
that
the
schools
teach
it
in
order
that
the
souls
and
hearts
of
the
pupils
may
become
vivified
and
exhilarated
and
their
lives
be
brightened
with
enjoyment
today
illumined
and
spiritual
children
are
gathered
in
this
meeting
they
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
for
such
souls
as
these
for
they
are
near
to
god
they
have
pure
hearts
they
have
spiritual
faces
the
effect
of
the
divine
teachings
is
manifest
in
the
perfect
purity
of
their
hearts
that
is
why
christ
has
addressed
the
world
saying
except
ye
be
converted
and
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaventhat
is
men
must
become
pure
in
heart
to
know
god
the
teachings
have
had
great
effect
spiritual
souls
tender
souls
the
hearts
of
all
children
are
of
the
utmost
purity
they
are
mirrors
upon
which
no
dust
has
fallen
but
this
purity
is
on
account
of
weakness
and
innocence
not
on
account
of
any
strength
and
testing
for
as
this
is
the
early
period
of
their
childhood
their
hearts
and
minds
are
unsullied
by
the
world
they
cannot
display
any
great
intelligence
they
have
neither
hypocrisy
nor
deceit
this
is
on
account
of
the
childs
weakness
whereas
the
man
becomes
pure
through
his
strength
through
the
power
of
intelligence
he
becomes
simple
through
the
great
power
of
reason
and
understanding
and
not
through
the
power
of
weakness
he
becomes
sincere
when
he
attains
to
the
state
of
perfection
he
will
receive
these
qualities
his
heart
becomes
purified
his
spirit
enlightened
his
soul
is
sensitized
and
tenderall
through
his
great
strength
this
is
the
difference
between
the
perfect
man
and
the
child
both
have
the
underlying
qualities
of
simplicity
and
sinceritythe
child
through
the
power
of
weakness
and
the
man
through
the
power
of
strength
i
pray
in
behalf
of
these
children
and
beg
confirmation
and
assistance
for
them
from
the
kingdom
of
abha
so
that
each
one
may
be
trained
under
the
shadow
of
the
protection
of
god
each
may
become
like
a
lighted
candle
in
the
world
of
humanity
a
tender
and
growing
plant
in
the
rose
garden
of
abha
that
these
children
may
be
so
trained
and
educated
that
they
shall
give
life
to
the
world
of
humanity
that
they
may
receive
insight
that
they
may
bestow
hearing
upon
the
people
of
the
world
that
they
may
sow
the
seeds
of
eternal
life
and
be
accepted
in
the
threshold
of
god
that
they
may
become
characterized
with
such
virtues
perfections
and
qualities
that
their
mothers
fathers
and
relatives
will
be
thankful
to
god
well
pleased
and
hopeful
this
is
my
wish
and
prayer
i
give
you
my
advice
and
it
is
this
train
these
children
with
divine
exhortations
from
their
childhood
instill
in
their
hearts
the
love
of
god
so
they
may
manifest
in
their
lives
the
fear
of
god
and
have
confidence
in
the
bestowals
of
god
teach
them
to
free
themselves
from
human
imperfections
and
to
acquire
the
divine
perfections
latent
in
the
heart
of
man
the
life
of
man
is
useful
if
he
attains
the
perfections
of
man
if
he
becomes
the
center
of
the
imperfections
of
the
world
of
humanity
death
is
better
than
life
and
nonexistence
better
than
existence
therefore
make
ye
an
effort
in
order
that
these
children
may
be
rightly
trained
and
educated
and
that
each
one
of
them
may
attain
perfection
in
the
world
of
humanity
know
ye
the
value
of
these
children
for
they
are
all
my
children

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
you
are
welcome
this
afternoon
most
welcome
i
am
ever
happy
to
see
you
i
ask
god
that
meeting
me
may
be
productive
of
results
that
it
may
not
be
like
ordinary
gatherings
for
those
who
hold
meetings
where
groups
of
people
assemble
usually
have
some
interest
to
further
praise
be
to
god
i
have
no
personal
interests
i
have
an
interest
in
the
kingdom
and
this
is
a
sincere
intention
i
have
perfect
love
for
you
therefore
i
have
traveled
this
long
distance
to
meet
and
greet
you
i
hope
that
these
gatherings
may
be
productive
of
great
results
and
there
is
no
greater
result
than
the
love
of
god
there
is
no
greater
result
than
bonds
of
service
in
the
divine
kingdom
and
attainment
to
the
good
pleasure
of
the
lord
therefore
i
desire
that
your
hearts
may
be
directed
to
the
kingdom
of
god
that
your
intentions
may
be
pure
and
sincere
your
purposes
turned
toward
altruistic
accomplishment
unmindful
of
your
own
welfare
nay
rather
may
all
your
intentions
center
in
the
welfare
of
humanity
and
may
you
seek
to
sacrifice
yourselves
in
the
pathway
of
devotion
to
mankind
even
as
jesus
christ
forfeited
his
life
may
you
likewise
offer
yourselves
in
the
threshold
of
sacrifice
for
the
betterment
of
the
world
and
just
as
bahaullah
suffered
severe
ordeals
and
calamities
nearly
fifty
years
for
you
may
you
be
willing
to
undergo
difficulties
and
withstand
catastrophes
for
humanity
in
general
may
you
bear
these
trials
and
tests
most
willingly
and
joyously
for
every
night
is
followed
by
a
day
and
every
day
has
a
night
every
spring
has
an
autumn
and
every
autumn
has
its
spring
the
coming
of
a
manifestation
of
god
is
the
season
of
spiritual
spring
for
instance
the
appearance
of
christ
was
a
divine
springtime
therefore
it
caused
a
great
commotion
and
vibrant
movement
in
the
world
of
humanity
the
sun
of
reality
dawned
the
cloud
of
mercy
poured
down
its
rain
the
breezes
of
providence
moved
the
world
became
a
new
world
mankind
reflected
an
extraordinary
radiance
souls
were
educated
minds
were
developed
intelligences
became
acute
and
the
human
world
attained
a
new
freshness
of
life
like
unto
the
advent
of
spring
then
gradually
that
spring
was
followed
by
the
autumn
of
death
and
decay
the
teachings
of
christ
were
forgotten
the
christly
bounties
ceased
divine
moralities
disappeared
day
ended
in
night
the
people
became
negligent
and
oblivious
minds
weakened
until
conditions
reached
such
a
crisis
that
material
science
rose
in
the
ascendant
knowledge
and
sciences
of
the
kingdom
became
obsolete
the
mysteries
of
god
deepened
and
the
traces
of
the
bounties
of
christ
were
completely
obliterated
the
nations
were
enmeshed
in
superstition
and
blind
imitation
discord
and
disagreement
arose
culminating
in
strife
war
and
bloodshed
hearts
were
torn
asunder
in
violence
various
denominations
appeared
diverse
sects
and
creeds
arose
and
the
whole
world
was
plunged
into
darkness
at
such
a
time
as
this
bahaullah
dawned
from
the
horizon
of
persia
he
reformed
and
renewed
the
fundamentals
and
realities
of
christs
teachings
he
endured
the
greatest
difficulties
and
underwent
the
severest
ordeals
praise
be
to
god
that
the
teachings
of
god
are
revoiced
the
light
of
reality
has
dawned
again
the
effulgence
is
increasing
daily
and
the
radiance
is
shining
more
gloriously
in
the
zenith
from
the
cloud
of
mercy
a
deluge
is
descending
the
sun
of
reality
is
brilliant
in
its
eternal
station
again
we
are
hopeful
that
the
same
springtime
may
pitch
its
tent
and
that
these
boundless
bestowals
may
appear
once
more
among
us
through
your
efforts
and
sincerity
this
is
made
possible
if
you
arise
in
the
cause
of
god
with
divine
power
heavenly
grace
the
sincerity
of
the
kingdom
a
merciful
heart
and
decisive
intention
it
is
certain
that
the
world
of
humanity
will
be
entirely
illumined
the
moralities
of
mankind
will
become
merciful
the
foundations
of
the
most
great
peace
will
be
laid
and
the
oneness
of
the
kingdom
of
man
will
become
a
reality
this
is
the
great
bounty
i

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
a
meeting
such
as
this
seems
like
a
beautiful
cluster
of
precious
jewelspearls
rubies
diamonds
sapphires
it
is
a
source
of
joy
and
delight
whatever
is
conducive
to
the
unity
of
the
world
of
mankind
is
most
acceptable
and
praiseworthy
whatever
is
the
cause
of
discord
and
disunion
is
saddening
and
deplorable
consider
the
significance
of
unity
and
harmony
this
evening
i
will
speak
to
you
upon
the
subject
of
existence
and
nonexistence
life
and
death
existence
is
the
expression
and
outcome
of
composition
and
combination
nonexistence
is
the
expression
and
outcome
of
division
and
disintegration
if
we
study
the
forms
of
existence
in
the
material
universe
we
find
that
all
created
things
are
the
result
of
composition
material
elements
have
grouped
together
in
infinite
variety
and
endless
forms
each
organism
is
a
compound
each
object
is
an
expression
of
elemental
affinity
we
find
the
complex
human
organism
simply
an
aggregation
of
cellular
structure
the
tree
is
a
composite
of
plant
cells
the
animal
a
combination
and
grouping
of
cellular
atoms
or
units
and
so
on
existence
or
the
expression
of
being
is
therefore
composition
and
nonexistence
is
decomposition
division
disintegration
when
elements
have
been
brought
together
in
a
certain
plan
of
combination
the
result
is
the
human
organism
when
these
elements
separate
and
disperse
the
outcome
is
death
and
nonexistence
life
is
therefore
the
product
of
composition
and
death
signifies
decomposition
likewise
in
the
world
of
minds
and
souls
fellowship
which
is
an
expression
of
composition
is
conducive
to
life
whereas
discord
which
is
an
expression
of
decomposition
is
the
equivalent
of
death
without
cohesion
among
the
individual
elements
which
compose
the
body
politic
disintegration
and
decay
must
inevitably
follow
and
life
be
extinguished
ferocious
animals
have
no
fellowship
the
vultures
and
tigers
are
solitary
whereas
domestic
animals
live
together
in
complete
harmony
the
sheep
black
and
white
associate
without
discord
birds
of
various
species
and
colors
wing
their
flight
and
feed
together
without
a
trace
of
enmity
or
disagreement
therefore
in
the
world
of
humanity
it
is
wise
and
seemly
that
all
the
individual
members
should

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
the
greatest
power
in
the
realm
and
range
of
human
existence
is
spiritthe
divine
breath
which
animates
and
pervades
all
things
it
is
manifested
throughout
creation
in
different
degrees
or
kingdoms
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
it
is
the
augmentative
spirit
or
power
of
growth
the
animus
of
life
and
development
in
plants
trees
and
organisms
of
the
floral
world
in
this
degree
of
its
manifestation
spirit
is
unconscious
of
the
powers
which
qualify
the
kingdom
of
the
animal
the
distinctive
virtue
or
plus
of
the
animal
is
sense
perception
it
sees
hears
smells
tastes
and
feels
but
is
incapable
in
turn
of
conscious
ideation
or
reflection
which
characterizes
and
differentiates
the
human
kingdom
the
animal
neither
exercises
nor
apprehends
this
distinctive
human
power
and
gift
from
the
visible
it
cannot
draw
conclusions
regarding
the
invisible
whereas
the
human
mind
from
visible
and
known
premises
attains
knowledge
of
the
unknown
and
invisible
for
instance
christopher
columbus
from
information
based
upon
known
and
provable
facts
drew
conclusions
which
led
him
unerringly
across
the
vast
ocean
to
the
unknown
continent
of
america
such
power
of
accomplishment
is
beyond
the
range
of
animal
intelligence
therefore
this
power
is
a
distinctive
attribute
of
the
human
spirit
and
kingdom
the
animal
spirit
cannot
penetrate
and
discover
the
mysteries
of
things
it
is
a
captive
of
the
senses
no
amount
of
teaching
for
instance
would
enable
it
to
grasp
the
fact
that
the
sun
is
stationary
and
the
earth
moves
around
it
likewise
the
human
spirit
has
its
limitations
it
cannot
comprehend
the
phenomena
of
the
kingdom
transcending
the
human
station
for
it
is
a
captive
of
powers
and
life
forces
which
have
their
operation
upon
its
own
plane
of
existence
and
it
cannot
go
beyond
that
boundary
there
is
however
another
spirit
which
may
be
termed
the
divine
to
which
jesus
christ
refers
when
he
declares
that
man
must
be
born
of
its
quickening
and
baptized
with
its
living
fire
souls
deprived
of
that
spirit
are
accounted
as
dead
though
they
are
possessed
of
the
human
spirit
jesus
christ
has
pronounced
them
dead
inasmuch
as
they
have
no
portion
of
the
divine
spirit
he
says
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
in
another
instance
he
declares
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
by
this
he
means
that
souls
though
alive
in
the
human
kingdom
are
nevertheless
dead
if
devoid
of
this
particular
spirit
of
divine
quickening
they
have
not
partaken
of
the
divine
life
of
the
higher
kingdom
for
the
soul
which
partakes
of
the
power
of
the
divine
spirit
is
verily
living
this
quickening
spirit
emanates
spontaneously
from
the
sun
of
truth
from
the
reality
of
divinity
and
is
not
a
revelation
or
a
manifestation
it
is
like
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
rays
are
emanations
from
the
sun
this
does
not
mean
that
the
sun
has
become
divisible
that
a
part
of
the
sun
has
come
out
into
space
this
plant
beside
me
has
risen
from
the
seed
therefore
it
is
a
manifestation
and
unfoldment
of
the
seed
the
seed
as
you
can
see
has
unfolded
in
manifestation
and
the
result
is
this
plant
every
leaf
of
the
plant
is
a
part
of
the
seed
but
the
reality
of
divinity
is
indivisible
and
each
individual
of
humankind
cannot
be
a
part
of
it
as
is
often
claimed
nay
rather
the
individual
realities
of
mankind
when
spiritually
born
are
emanations
from
the
reality
of
divinity
just
as
the
flame
heat
and
light
of
the
sun
are
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
and
not
a
part
of
the
sun
itself
therefore
a
spirit
has
emanated
from
the
reality
of
divinity
and
its
effulgences
have
become
visible
in
human
entities
or
realities
this
ray
and
this
heat
are
permanent
there
is
no
cessation
in
the
effulgence
as
long
as
the
sun
exists
the
heat
and
light
will
exist
and
inasmuch
as
eternality
is
a
property
of
divinity
this
emanation
is
everlasting
there
is
no
cessation
in
its
outpouring
the
more
the
world
of
humanity
develops
the
more
the
effulgences
or
emanations
of
divinity
will
become
revealed
just
as
the
stone
when
it
becomes
polished
and
pure
as
a
mirror
will
reflect
in
fuller
degree
the
glory
and
splendor
of
the
sun
the
mission
of
the
prophets
the
revelation
of
the
holy
books
the
manifestation
of
the
heavenly
teachers
and
the
purpose
of
divine
philosophy
all
center
in
the
training
of
the
human
realities
so
that
they
may
become
clear
and
pure
as
mirrors
and
reflect
the
light
and
love
of
the
sun
of
reality
therefore
i
hope
thatwhether
you
be
in
the
east
or
the
westyou
will
strive
with
heart
and
soul
in
order
that
day
by
day
the
world
of
humanity
may
become
glorified
more
spiritual
more
sanctified
and
that
the
splendor
of
the
sun
of
reality
may
be
revealed
fully
in
human
hearts
as
in
a
mirror
this
is
worthy
of
the
world
of
mankind
this
is
the
true
evolution
and
progress
of
humanity
this
is
the
supreme
bestowal
otherwise
by
simple
development
along
material
lines
man
is
not
perfected
at
most
the
physical
aspect
of
man
his
natural
or
material
conditions
may
become
stabilized
and
improved
but
he
will
remain
deprived
of
the
spiritual
or
divine
bestowal
he
is
then
like
a
body
without
a
spirit
a
lamp
without
the
light
an
eye
without
the
power
of
vision
an
ear
that
hears
no
sound
a
mind
incapable
of
perceiving
an
intellect
minus
the
power
of
reason
man
has
two
powers
and
his
development
two
aspects
one
power
is
connected
with
the
material
world
and
by
it
he
is
capable
of
material
advancement
the
other
power
is
spiritual
and
through
its
development
his
inner
potential
nature
is
awakened
these
powers
are
like
two
wings
both
must
be
developed
for
flight
is
impossible
with
one
wing
praise
be
to
god
material
advancement
has
been
evident
in
the
world
but
there
is
need
of
spiritual
advancement
in
like
proportion
we
must
strive
unceasingly
and
without
rest
to
accomplish
the
development
of
the
spiritual
nature
in
man
and
endeavor
with
tireless
energy
to
advance
humanity
toward
the
nobility
of
its
true
and
intended
station
for
the
body
of
man
is
accidental
it
is
of
no
importance
the
time
of
its
disintegration
will
inevitably
come
but
the
spirit
of
man
is
essential
and
therefore
eternal
it
is
a
divine
bounty
it
is
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
and
therefore
of
greater
importance
than
the
physical
body
i
pray
for
you
you
have
come
to
visit
me
and
i
am
most
grateful
i
shall
ask
confirmation
and
assistance
for
you
from

generous

you
may

today
the
greatest
need
of
the
world
of
humanity
is
discontinuance
of
the
existing
misunderstandings
among
nations
this
can
be
accomplished
through
the
unity
of
language
unless
the
unity
of
languages
is
realized
the
most
great
peace
and
the
oneness
of
the
human
world
cannot
be
effectively
organized
and
established
because
the
function
of
language
is
to
portray
the
mysteries
and
secrets
of
human
hearts
the
heart
is
like
a
box
and
language
is
the
key
only
by
using
the
key
can
we
open
the
box
and
observe
the
gems
it
contains
therefore
the
question
of
an
auxiliary
international
tongue
has
the
utmost
importance
through
this
means
international
education
and
training
become
possible
the
evidence
and
history
of
the
past
can
be
acquired
the
spread
of
the
known
facts
of
the
human
world
depends
upon
language
the
explanation
of
divine
teachings
can
only
be
through
this
medium
as
long
as
diversity
of
tongues
and
lack
of
comprehension
of
other
languages
continue
these
glorious
aims
cannot
be
realized
therefore
the
very
first
service
to
the
world
of
man
is
to
establish
this
auxiliary
international
means
of
communication
it
will
become
the
cause
of
the
tranquillity
of
the
human
commonwealth
through
it
sciences
and
arts
will
be
spread
among
the
nations
and
it
will
prove
to
be
the
means
of
the
progress
and
development
of
all
races
we
must
endeavor
with
all
our
powers
to
establish
this
international
auxiliary
language
throughout
the
world
it
is
my
hope
that
it
may
be
perfected
through
the
bounties
of
god
and
that
intelligent
men
may
be
selected
from
the
various
countries
of
the
world
to
organize
an
international
congress
whose
chief
aim
will
be
the
promotion

in
the
world
of
existence
the
greatest
bestowals
of
god
are
his
teachings
the
other
bounties
of
god
are
limited
as
regards
their
benefits
and
provision
human
existence
itself
is
a
divine
bestowal
but
it
is
circumscribed
with
limitations
sight
and
hearing
are
bounties
of
god
both
are
limited
and
so
it
is
with
all
the
other
bestowals
the
circle
of
their
operation
is
confined
restricted
whereas
the
sphere
of
the
divine
teachings
is
boundless
centuries
and
ages
pass
away
but
their
efficacy
continues
like
the
spirit
of
life
which
animates
the
world
of
existence
without
the
teachings
of
god
the
world
of
humanity
is
like
the
animal
kingdom
what
difference
is
there
between
the
animal
and
man
the
difference
is
this
that
the
animal
is
not
capable
of
apprehending
the
divine
teachings
whereas
man
is
worthy
of
them
and
possesses
the
capacity
to
understand
in
the
animal
kingdom
there
is
no
such
bestowal
therefore
there
is
limited
progression
at
most
evolution
in
that
kingdom
is
a
development
of
the
organism
in
the
beginning
it
is
small
undeveloped
it
develops
becomes
larger
but
its
sphere
of
intellectual
growth
is
limited
therefore
the
teachings
of
god
are
the
bestowals
specialized
for
man
although
the
divine
teachings
are
truth
and
reality
yet
with
the
passage
of
time
thick
clouds
envelop
and
obscure
them
these
clouds
are
imitations
and
superstitions
they
are
not
the
fundamentals
then
the
sun
of
truth
the
word
of
god
arises
again
shines
forth
once
more
in
the
glory
of
its
power
and
disperses
the
enveloping
darkness
for
a
long
time
the
divine
precepts
of
the
effulgent
word
were
obscured
by
clouds
of
superstition
and
error
until
bahaullah
appeared
upon
the
horizon
of
humanity
rent
the
shadows
scattered
the
clouds
and
revealed
anew
the
foundations
of
the
teachings
of
god
the
first
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
duty
incumbent
upon
all
to
investigate
reality
what
does
it
mean
to
investigate
reality
it
means
that
man
must
forget
all
hearsay
and
examine
truth
himself
for
he
does
not
know
whether
statements
he
hears
are
in
accordance
with
reality
or
not
wherever
he
finds
truth
or
reality
he
must
hold
to
it
forsaking
discarding
all
else
for
outside
of
reality
there
is
naught
but
superstition
and
imagination
for
example
during
the
days
of
jesus
christ
the
jews
were
expecting
the
appearance
of
the
messiah
praying
and
beseeching
god
day
and
night
that
the
promised
one
might
appear
why
did
they
reject
him
when
he
did
appear
they
denied
him
absolutely
refused
to
believe
in
him
there
was
no
abuse
and
persecution
which
they
did
not
heap
upon
him
they
reviled
him
with
curses
placed
a
crown
of
thorns
upon
his
head
led
him
through
the
streets
in
scorn
and
derision
and
finally
crucified
him
why
did
they
do
this
because
they
did
not
investigate
the
truth
or
reality
of
christ
and
were
not
able
to
recognize
him
as
the
messiah
of
god
had
they
investigated
sincerely
for
themselves
they
would
surely
have
believed
in
him
respected
him
and
bowed
before
him
in
reverence
they
would
have
considered
his
manifestation
the
greatest
bestowal
upon
mankind
they
would
have
accepted
him
as
the
very
savior
of
man
but
alas
they
were
veiled
they
held
to
imitations
of
ancestral
beliefs
and
hearsay
and
did
not
investigate
the
truth
of
christ
they
were
submerged
in
the
sea
of
superstitions
and
were
therefore
deprived
of
witnessing
that
glorious
bounty
they
were
withheld
from
the
fragrances
or
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
suffered
in
themselves
the
greatest
debasement
and
degradation
reality
or
truth
is
one
yet
there
are
many
religious
beliefs
denominations
creeds
and
differing
opinions
in
the
world
today
why
should
these
differences
exist
because
they
do
not
investigate
and
examine
the
fundamental
unity
which
is
one
and
unchangeable
if
they
seek
reality
itself
they
will
agree
and
be
united
for
reality
is
indivisible
and
not
multiple
it
is
evident
therefore
that
there
is
nothing
of
greater
importance
to
mankind
than
the
investigation
of
truth
the
second
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
every
human
creature
is
the
servant
of
god
all
have
been
created
and
reared
by
the
power
and
favor
of
god
all
have
been
blessed
with
the
bounties
of
the
same
sun
of
divine
truth
all
have
quaffed
from
the
fountain
of
the
infinite
mercy
of
god
and
all
in
his
estimation
and
love
are
equal
as
servants
he
is
beneficent
and
kind
to
all
therefore
no
one
should
glorify
himself
over
another
no
one
should
manifest
pride
or
superiority
toward
another
no
one
should
look
upon
another
with
scorn
and
contempt
and
no
one
should
deprive
or
oppress
a
fellow
creature
all
must
be
considered
as
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
gods
mercy
we
must
associate
with
all
humanity
in
gentleness
and
kindliness
we
must
love
all
with
love
of
the
heart
some
are
ignorant
they
must
be
trained
and
educated
one
is
sick
he
must
be
healed
another
is
as
a
child
we
must
assist
him
to
attain
maturity
we
must
not
detest
him
who
is
ailing
neither
shun
him
scorn
nor
curse
him
but
care
for
him
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
tenderness
an
infant
must
not
be
treated
with
disdain
simply
because
it
is
an
infant
our
responsibility
is
to
train
educate
and
develop
it
in
order
that
it
may
advance
toward
maturity
the
third
teaching
or
principle
of
bahaullah
is
that
religion
and
science
are
in
complete
agreement
every
religion
which
is
not
in
accordance
with
established
science
is
superstition
religion
must
be
reasonable
if
it
does
not
square
with
reason
it
is
superstition
and
without
foundation
it
is
like
a
mirage
which
deceives
man
by
leading
him
to
think

god
has
endowed
man
with
reason
that
he
may
perceive
what
is
true
if
we
insist
that
such
and
such
a
subject
is
not
to
be
reasoned
out
and
tested
according
to
the
established
logical
modes
of
the
intellect
what
is
the
use
of
the
reason
which
god
has
given
man
the
eye
is
the
organ
of
sense
by
which
we
view
the
world
of
outer
phenomena
hearing
is
the
faculty
for
distinguishing
sounds
taste
senses
the
properties
of
objects
such
as
bitter
sweet
smell
detects
and
differentiates
odors
touch
reveals
attributes
of
matter
and
perfects
our
communication
with
the
outer
world
yet
after
all
the
circle
and
range
of
perception
by
the
five
senses
is
exceedingly
limited
but
the
intellectual
faculty
of
man
is
unlimited
in
its
sphere
of
action
the
eye
views
details
perhaps
a
mile
but
the
intellect
can
perceive
the
far
east
and
west
the
ear
may
hear
tone
modulations
at
one
thousand
feet
but
the
mind
of
man
can
detect
the
harmonies
of
the
heavenly
spheres
as
they
swing
in
their
courses

the

come
forth
from
the
intellect
of

it
is
evident
that
within

the

occupies
the

station
therefore
if

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
among
the
institutes
of
the
holy
books
is
that
of
the
foundation
of
places
of
worship
that
is
to
say
an
edifice
or
temple
is
to
be
built
in
order
that
humanity
might
find
a
place
of
meeting
and
this
is
to
be
conducive
to
unity
and
fellowship
among
them
the
real
temple
is
the
very
word
of
god
for
to
it
all
humanity
must
turn
and
it
is
the
center
of
unity
for
all
mankind
it
is
the
collective
center
the
cause
of
accord
and
communion
of
hearts
the
sign
of
the
solidarity
of
the
human
race
the
source
of
eternal
life
temples
are
the
symbols
of
the
divine
uniting
force
so
that
when
the
people
gather
there
in
the
house
of
god
they
may
recall
the
fact
that
the
law
has
been
revealed
for
them
and
that
the
law
is
to
unite
them
they
will
realize
that
just
as
this
temple
was
founded
for
the
unification
of
mankind
the
law
preceding
and
creating
it
came
forth
in
the
manifest
word
jesus
christ
addressing
peter
said
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
this
utterance
was
indicative
of
the
faith
of
peter
signifying
this
faith
of
thine
o
peter
is
the
very
cause
and
message
of
unity
to
the
nations
it
shall
be
the
bond
of
union
between
the
hearts
of
men
and
the
foundation
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
in
brief
the
original
purpose
of
temples
and
houses
of
worship
is
simply
that
of
unityplaces
of
meeting
where
various
peoples
different
races
and
souls
of
every
capacity
may
come
together
in
order
that
love
and
agreement
should
be
manifest
between
them
that
is
why
bahaullah
has
commanded
that
a
place
of
worship
be
built
for
all
the
religionists
of
the
world
that
all
religions
races
and
sects
may
come
together
within
its
universal
shelter
that
the
proclamation
of
the
oneness
of
mankind
shall
go
forth
from
its
open
courts
of
holinessthe
announcement
that
humanity
is
the
servant
of
god
and
that
all
are
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
his
mercy
it
is
the
mashriquladhkar
the
world
of
existence
may
be
likened
to
this
temple
and
place
of
worship
for
just
as
the
external
world
is
a
place
where
the
people
of
all
races
and
colors
varying
faiths
denominations
and
conditions
come
togetherjust
as
they
are
submerged
in
the
same
sea
of
divine
favorsso
likewise
all
may
meet
under
the
dome
of
the
mashriquladhkar
and
adore
the
one
god
in
the
same
spirit
of
truth
for
the
ages
of
darkness
have
passed
away
and
the
century
of
light
has
come
ignorant
prejudices
are
being
dispelled
and
the
light
of
unity
is
shining
the
differences
existing
between
nations
and
peoples
will
soon
be
annulled
and
the
fundamentals
of
the
divine
religions
which
are
no
other
than
the
oneness
and
solidarity
of
the
human
race
are
being
established
for
thousands
of
years
the
human
race
has
been
at
war
it
is
enough
now
let
mankind
for
a
time
at
least
consort
in
amity
and
peace
enmity
and
hatred
have
ruled
let
the
world
for
a
period
exercise
love
for
thousands
of
years
the
nations
have
denied
each
other
considering
each
other
as
infidel
and
inferior
it
is
sufficient
we
must
now
realize
that
we
are
the
servants
of
one
god
that
we
turn
to
one
beneficent
father
live
under
one
divine
law
seek
one
reality
and
have
one
desire
thus
may
we
live
in
the
utmost
friendship
and
love
and
in
return
the
favors
and
bounties
of
god
shall
surround
us
the
world
of
humanity
will
be
reformed
mankind
enjoy
a
new
life
eternal
light
will
illumine
and
heavenly
moralities
become
manifest
then
divine
policy
shall
govern
the
world
for
the
divine
policy
is
the
oneness
of
humanity
god
is
just
and
kind
to
all
he
considers
all
as
his
servants
he
excludes
none
and
his
judgments
are
correct
and
true
no
matter
how
complete
human
policy
and
foresight
may
appear
they
are
imperfect
if
we
do
not
seek
the
counsel
of
god
or
if
we
refuse
to
follow
his
dictates
it
is
presumptive
evidence
that
we
are
knowing
and
wise
whereas
god
is
ignorant
that
we
are
sagacious
and
god
is
not
god
forbid
we
seek
shelter
in
his
mercy
for
this
suggestion
no
matter
how
far
the
human
intelligence
may
advance
it
is
still
but
a
drop
while
divine
omniscience
is
the
ocean
shall
we
say
that
a
drop
is
imbued
or
endowed
with
qualities
of
which
the
ocean
is
devoid
shall
we
believe
that
the
policy
and
plan
of
this
atom
of
a
human
soul
are
superior
to
the
wisdom
of
the
omniscient
there
is
no
greater
ignorance
than
this
briefly
some
are
mere
children
with
the
utmost
love
we
must
educate
them
to
make
them
wise
others
are
sick
and
ailing
we
must
tenderly
treat
them
until
they
recover
some
have
unworthy
morals
we
must
train
them
toward
the
standard
of
true
morality
other
than
this
we
are
all
the
servants
of
one
god
and
under
the
providence
and
protection
of
one
father
these
are
the
institutions
of
god
and
the
foundations
of
his
temple
the
mashriquladhkar
the
outer
edifice
is
a
symbol
of
the

the

be
admonished

in
your

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
when
we
view
the
world
of
creation
we
find
that
all
living
things
may
be
classified
under
two
aspects
of
existence
first
they
possess
bodies
composed
of
material
substance
common
to
allwhether
vegetable
animal
or
human
this
is
their
point
of
agreement
or
as
it
is
philosophically
termed
their
point
of
contact
second
they
vary
and
differ
from
each
other
in
degree
and
functionthat
is
to
say
in
their
respective
kingdoms
this
is
their
point
of
distinction
and
differentiation
for
instance
the
vegetable
and
animal
are
alike
in
the
fact
that
their
bodies
are
composed
of
the
same
material
elements
but
widely
different
in
their
kingdoms
and
powers
man
is
like
the
animal
in
physical
structure
but
otherwise
immeasurably
separated
and
superior
in
the
human
kingdom
itself
there
are
points
of
contact
properties
common
to
all
mankind
likewise
there
are
points
of
distinction
which
separate
race
from
race
individual
from
individual
if
the
points
of
contact
which
are
the
common
properties
of
humanity
overcome
the
peculiar
points
of
distinction
unity
is
assured
on
the
other
hand
if
the
points
of
differentiation
overcome
the
points
of
agreement
disunion
and
weakness
result
one
of
the
important
questions
which
affect
the
unity
and
the
solidarity
of
mankind
is
the
fellowship
and
equality
of
the
white
and
colored
races
between
these
two
races
certain
points
of
agreement
and
points
of
distinction
exist
which
warrant
just
and
mutual
consideration
the
points
of
contact
are
many
for
in
the
material
or
physical
plane
of
being
both
are
constituted
alike
and
exist
under
the
same
law
of
growth
and
bodily
development
furthermore
both
live
and
move
in
the
plane
of
the
senses
and
are
endowed
with
human
intelligence
there
are
many
other
mutual
qualifications
in
this
country
the
united
states
of
america
patriotism
is
common
to
both
races
all
have
equal
rights
to
citizenship
speak
one
language
receive
the
blessings
of
the
same
civilization
and
follow
the
precepts
of
the
same
religion
in
fact
numerous
points
of
partnership
and
agreement
exist
between
the
two
races
whereas
the
one
point
of
distinction
is
that
of
color
shall
this
the
least
of
all
distinctions
be
allowed
to
separate
you
as
races
and
individuals
in
physical
bodies
in
the
law
of
growth
in
sense
endowment
intelligence
patriotism
language
citizenship
civilization
and
religion
you
are
one
and
the
same
a
single
point
of
distinction
existsthat
of
racial
color
god
is
not
pleased
withneither
should
any
reasonable
or
intelligent
man
be
willing
to
recognizeinequality
in
the
races
because
of
this
distinction
but
there
is
need
of
a
superior
power
to
overcome
human
prejudices
a
power
which
nothing
in
the
world
of
mankind
can
withstand
and
which
will
overshadow
the
effect
of
all
other
forces
at
work
in
human
conditions
that
irresistible
power
is
the
love
of
god
it
is
my
hope
and
prayer
that
it
may
destroy
the
prejudice
of
this
one
point
of
distinction
between
you
and
unite
you
all
permanently
under
its
hallowed
protection
bahaullah
has
proclaimed
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
he
has
caused
various
nations
and
divergent
creeds
to
unite
he
has
declared
that
difference
of
race
and
color
is
like
the
variegated
beauty
of
flowers
in
a
garden
if
you
enter
a
garden
you
will
see
yellow
white
blue
red
flowers
in
profusion
and
beautyeach
radiant
within
itself
and
although
different
from
the
others
lending
its
own
charm
to
them
racial
difference
in
the
human
kingdom
is
similar
if
all
the
flowers
in
a
garden
were
of
the
same
color
the
effect
would
be
monotonous
and
wearying
to
the
eye
therefore
bahaullah
hath
said
that
the
various
races
of
humankind
lend
a
composite
harmony
and
beauty
of
color
to
the
whole
let
all
associate
therefore
in
this
great
human
garden
even
as

grow
and
blend
together

by

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
according
to
the
words
of
the
old
testament
god
has
said
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
this
indicates
that
man
is
of
the
image
and
likeness
of
godthat
is
to
say
the
perfections
of
god
the
divine
virtues
are
reflected
or
revealed
in
the
human
reality
just
as
the
light
and
effulgence
of
the
sun
when
cast
upon
a
polished
mirror
are
reflected
fully
gloriously
so
likewise
the
qualities
and
attributes
of
divinity
are
radiated
from
the
depths
of
a
pure
human
heart
this
is
an
evidence
that
man
is
the
most
noble
of
gods
creatures
each
kingdom
of
creation
is
endowed
with
its
necessary
complement
of
attributes
and
powers
the
mineral
possesses
inherent
virtues
of
its
own
kingdom
in
the
scale
of
existence
the
vegetable
possesses
the
qualities
of
the
mineral
plus
an
augmentative
virtue
or
power
of
growth
the
animal
is
endowed
with
the
virtues
of
both
the
mineral
and
vegetable
plane
plus
the
power
of
intellect
the
human
kingdom
is
replete
with
the
perfections
of
all
the
kingdoms
below
it
with
the
addition
of
powers
peculiar
to
man
alone
man
is
therefore
superior
to
all
the
creatures
below
him
the
loftiest
and
most
glorious
being
of
creation
man
is
the
microcosm
and
the
infinite
universe
the
macrocosm
the
mysteries
of
the
greater
world
or
macrocosm
are
expressed
or
revealed
in
the
lesser
world
the
microcosm
the
tree
so
to
speak
is
the
greater
world
and
the
seed
in
its
relation
to
the
tree
is
the
lesser
world
but
the
whole
of
the
great
tree
is
potentially
latent
and
hidden
in
the
little
seed
when
this
seed
is
planted
and
cultivated
the
tree
is
revealed
likewise
the
greater
world
the
macrocosm
is
latent
and
miniatured
in
the
lesser
world
or
microcosm
of
man
this
constitutes
the
universality
or
perfection
of
virtues
potential
in
mankind
therefore
it
is
said
that
man
has
been
created
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
let
us
now
discover
more
specifically
how
he
is
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
and
what
is
the
standard
or
criterion
by
which
he
can
be
measured
and
estimated
this
standard
can
be
no
other
than
the
divine
virtues
which
are
revealed
in
him
therefore
every
man
imbued
with
divine
qualities
who
reflects
heavenly
moralities
and
perfections
who
is
the
expression
of
ideal
and
praiseworthy
attributes
is
verily
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
if
a
man
possesses
wealth
can
we
call
him
an
image
and
likeness
of
god
or
is
human
honor
and
notoriety
the
criterion
of
divine
nearness
can
we
apply
the
test
of
racial
color
and
say
that
man
of
a
certain
huewhite
black
brown
yellow
redis
the
true
image
of
his
creator
we
must
conclude
that
color
is
not
the
standard
and
estimate
of
judgment
and
that
it
is
of
no
importance
for
color
is
accidental
in
nature
the
spirit
and
intelligence
of
man
is
essential
and
that
is
the
manifestation
of
divine
virtues
the
merciful
bestowals
of
god
the
eternal
life
and
baptism
through
the
holy
spirit
therefore
be
it
known
that
color
or
race
is
of
no
importance
he
who
is
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
who
is
the
manifestation
of
the
bestowals
of
god
is
acceptable
at
the
threshold
of
godwhether
his
color
be
white
black
or
brown
it
matters
not
man
is
not
man
simply
because
of
bodily
attributes
the
standard
of
divine
measure
and
judgment
is
his
intelligence
and
spirit
therefore
let
this
be
the
only
criterion
and
estimate
for
this
is
the
image

a
mans
heart
may
be
pure
and
white
though
his
outer
skin
be
black
or
his
heart
be
dark
and
sinful
though
his
racial
color
is
white
the
character
and
purity
of
the
heart
is
of
all
importance
the
heart
illumined
by
the
light
of
god
is
nearest

dearest
to
god
and
inasmuch
as
god
has
endowed
man
with
such
favor
that
he
is
called
the
image
of
god
this
is
truly
a
supreme
perfection
of
attainment
a

which
is
not

the
power
which
has
gathered
you
here
today
notwithstanding
the
cold
and
windy
weather
is
indeed
mighty
and
wonderful
it
is
the
power
of
god
the
divine
favor
of
bahaullah
which
has
drawn
you
together
we
praise
god
that
through
his
constraining
love
human
souls
are
assembled
and
associated
in
this
way
thousands
of
mashriquladhkars
dawning
points
of
praise
and
mention
of
god
for
all
religionists
will
be
built
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
but
this
being
the
first
one
erected
in

has
great
importance
in
the

there
will

this

in

is
of
especial
significance
it
has
the
same
importance
as
the
mashriquladhkar
in
ishqabad
caucasus
russia
the
first
one
built
there
in
persia
there
are
many
some
are
houses
which
have
been
utilized
for
the
purpose
others
are
homes
entirely
devoted
to
the
divine
cause
and
in
some
places
temporary
structures
have
been
erected
in
all
the
cities
of
persia
there
are
mashriquladhkars
but
the
great
dawning
point
was
founded
in
ishqabad
it
possesses
superlative
importance
because
it
was
the
first
mashriquladhkar
built
all
the
bahai
friends
agreed
and
contributed
their
utmost
assistance
and
effort
the
afnan
devoted
his
wealth
gave
all
he
had
to
it
from
such
a
mighty
and
combined
effort
a
beautiful
edifice
arose
notwithstanding
their
contributions
to
that
building
they
have
assisted
the
fund
here
in
chicago
as
well
the
mashriquladhkar
in
ishqabad
is
almost
completed
it
is
centrally
located
nine
avenues
leading
into
it
nine
gardens
nine
fountains
all
the
arrangement
and
construction
is
according
to
the
principle
and
proportion
of
the
number
nine
it
is
like
a
beautiful
bouquet
imagine
a
very
lofty
imposing
edifice
surrounded
completely
by
gardens
of
variegated
flowers
with
nine
avenues
leading
through
them
nine
fountains
and
pools
of
water
such
is
its
matchless
beautiful
design
now
they
are
building
a
hospital
a
school
for
orphans
a
home
for
cripples
a
hospice
and
a
large
dispensary
god
willing
when
it
is
fully
completed
it
will
be
a
paradise
i
hope
the
mashriquladhkar
in
chicago
will
be
like
this
endeavor
to
have
the
grounds
circular
in
shape
if
possible
adjust
and
exchange
the
plots
in
order
to
make
the
dimensions
and

circular
the

cannot
be

it

notes

joseph
h
hannen
in
this
cause
consultation
is
of
vital
importance
but
spiritual
conference
and
not
the
mere
voicing
of
personal
views
is
intended
in
france
i
was
present
at
a
session
of
the
senate
but
the
experience
was
not
impressive
parliamentary
procedure
should
have
for
its
object
the
attainment
of
the
light
of
truth
upon
questions
presented
and
not
furnish
a
battleground
for
opposition
and
selfopinion
antagonism
and
contradiction
are
unfortunate
and
always
destructive
to
truth
in
the
parliamentary
meeting
mentioned
altercation
and
useless
quibbling
were
frequent
the
result
mostly
confusion
and
turmoil
even
in
one
instance
a
physical
encounter
took
place
between
two
members
it
was
not
consultation
but
comedy
the
purpose
is
to
emphasize
the
statement
that
consultation
must
have
for
its
object
the
investigation
of
truth
he
who
expresses
an
opinion
should
not
voice
it
as
correct
and
right
but
set
it
forth
as
a
contribution
to
the
consensus
of
opinion
for
the
light
of
reality
becomes
apparent
when
two
opinions
coincide
a
spark
is
produced
when
flint
and
steel
come
together
man
should
weigh
his
opinions
with
the
utmost
serenity
calmness
and
composure
before
expressing
his
own
views
he
should
carefully
consider
the
views
already
advanced
by
others
if
he
finds
that
a
previously
expressed
opinion
is
more
true
and
worthy
he
should
accept
it
immediately
and
not
willfully
hold
to
an
opinion
of
his
own
by
this
excellent
method
he
endeavors
to
arrive
at
unity
and
truth
opposition
and
division
are
deplorable
it
is
better
then
to
have
the
opinion
of
a
wise
sagacious
man
otherwise
contradiction
and
altercation
in
which
varied
and
divergent
views
are
presented
will
make
it
necessary
for
a
judicial
body
to
render
decision
upon
the
question
even
a
majority
opinion
or
consensus
may
be
incorrect
a
thousand
people
may
hold
to
one
view
and
be
mistaken
whereas
one
sagacious
person
may
be
right
therefore
true
consultation
is
spiritual
conference
in
the
attitude
and
atmosphere
of
love
members
must
love
each
other
in
the
spirit
of
fellowship
in
order
that
good
results
may
be
forthcoming
love
and
fellowship
are
the
foundation
the
most
memorable
instance
of
spiritual
consultation
was
the
meeting
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
christ
upon
the
mount
after
his
ascension
they
said
jesus
christ
has
been
crucified
and
we
have
no
longer
association
and
intercourse
with
him
in
his
physical
body
therefore
we
must
be
loyal
and
faithful
to
him
we
must
be
grateful
and
appreciate
him
for
he
has
raised
us
from
the
dead
he
made
us
wise
he
has
given
us
eternal
life
what
shall
we
do
to
be
faithful
to
him
and
so
they
held
council
one
of
them
said
we
must
detach
ourselves
from
the
chains
and
fetters
of
the
world
otherwise
we
cannot
be
faithful
the
others
replied
that
is
so
another
said
either
we
must
be
married
and
faithful
to
our
wives
and
children
or
serve
our
lord
free
from
these
ties
we
cannot
be
occupied
with
the
care
and
provision
for
families
and
at
the
same
time
herald
the
kingdom
in
the
wilderness
therefore
let
those
who
are
unmarried
remain
so
and
those
who
have
married
provide
means
of
sustenance
and
comfort
for
their
families
and
then
go
forth
to
spread
the
message
of
glad
tidings
there
were
no
dissenting
voices
all
agreed
saying
that
is
right
a
third
disciple
said
to
perform
worthy
deeds
in
the
kingdom
we
must
be
further
selfsacrificing
from
now
on
we
should
forego
ease
and
bodily
comfort
accept
every
difficulty
forget
self
and
teach
the
cause
of
god
this
found
acceptance
and
approval
by
all
the
others
finally
a
fourth
disciple
said
there
is
still
another
aspect
to
our
faith
and
unity
for
jesus
sake
we
shall
be
beaten
imprisoned
and
exiled
they
may
kill
us
let
us
receive
this
lesson
now
let
us
realize
and
resolve
that
though
we
are
beaten
banished
cursed
spat
upon
and
led
forth
to
be
killed
we
shall
accept
all
this
joyfully
loving
those
who
hate
and
wound
us
all
the
disciples
replied
surely
we
willit
is
agreed
this
is
right
then
they
descended
from
the
summit
of
the
mountain
and
each
went
forth
in
a
different
direction
upon
his
divine
mission
this
was
true
consultation
this
was
spiritual
consultation
and
not
the
mere
voicing
of
personal
views

notes
by

one
of
the
functions
of
the
sun
is
to
quicken
and
reveal
the
hidden
realities
of
the
kingdoms
of
existence
through
the
light
and
heat
of
the
great
central
luminary
all
that
is
potential
in
the
earth
is
awakened
and
comes
forth
into
the
realm
of
the
visible
the
fruit
hidden
in
the
tree
appears
upon
its
branches
in
response
to
the
power
of
the
sun
man
and
all
other
organisms
live
move
and
have
their
being
under
its
developing
rays
nature
is
resplendent
with
countless
evolutionary
forms
through
its
pervading
impulseso
that
we
can
say
a
function
of
the
sun
is
the
revelation
of
the
mysteries
and
creative
purposes
hidden
within
the
phenomenal
world
the
outer
sun
is
a
sign
or
symbol
of
the
inner
and
ideal
sun
of
truth
the
word
of
god
inasmuch
as
this
is
the
century
of
light
it
is
evident
that
the
sun
of
reality
the
word
has
revealed
itself
to
all
humankind
one
of
the
potentialities
hidden
in
the
realm
of
humanity
was
the
capability
or
capacity
of
womanhood
through
the
effulgent
rays
of
divine
illumination
the
capacity
of
woman
has
become
so
awakened
and
manifest
in
this
age
that
equality
of
man
and
woman
is
an
established
fact
in
past
ages
woman
was
wronged
and
oppressed
this
was
especially
the
case
in
asia
and
africa
in
certain
parts
of
asia
women
were
not
considered
as
members
of
humankind
they
were
looked
upon
as
inferior
unworthy
creatures
subordinate
and
subject
to
man
a
certain
people
known
as
the
nusayris
held
to
the
belief
for
a
long
period
that
woman
was
the
incarnation
of
the
evil
spirit
or
satan
and
that
man
alone
was
the
manifestation
of
god
the
merciful
at
last
this
century
of
light
dawned
the
realities
shone
forth
and
the
mysteries
long
hidden
from
human
vision
were
revealed
among
these
revealed
realities
was
the
great
principle
of
the
equality
of
man
and
woman
which
is
now
finding
recognition
throughout
the
whole
worldamerica
europe
and
the
orient
history
records
the
appearance
in
the
world
of
women
who
have
been
signs
of
guidance
power
and
accomplishment
some
were
notable
poets
some
philosophers
and
scientists
others
courageous
upon
the
field
of
battle
qurratulayn
a
bahai
was
a
poetess
she
discomfited
the
learned
men
of
persia
by
her
brilliancy
and
fervor
when
she
entered
a
meeting
even
the
learned
were
silent
she
was
so
well
versed
in
philosophy
and
science
that
those
in
her
presence
always
considered
and
consulted
her
first
her
courage
was
unparalleled
she
faced
her
enemies
fearlessly
until
she
was
killed
she
withstood
a
despotic
king
the
shah
of
persia
who
had
the
power
to
decree
the
death
of
any
of
his
subjects
there
was
not
a
day
during
which
he
did
not
command
the
execution
of
some
this
woman
singly
and
alone
withstood
such
a
despot
until
her
last
breath
then
gave
her
life
for
her
faith
consider
the
mysteries
revealed
during
the
last
half
century
all
due
to
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
which
has
been
so
gloriously
manifested
in
this
age
and
cycle
in
this
day
man
must
investigate
reality
impartially
and
without
prejudice
in
order
to
reach
the
true
knowledge
and
conclusions
what
then
constitutes
the
inequality
between
man
and
woman
both
are
human
in
powers
and
function
each
is
the
complement
of
the
other
at
most
it
is
this
that
woman
has
been
denied
the
opportunities
which
man
has
so
long
enjoyed
especially
the
privilege
of
education
but
even
this
is
not
always
a
shortcoming
shall
we
consider
it
an
imperfection
and
weakness
in
her
nature
that
she
is
not
proficient
in
the
school
of
military
tactics
that
she
cannot
go
forth
to
the
field
of
battle
and
kill
that
she
is
not
able
to
handle
a
deadly
weapon
nay
rather
is
it
not
a
compliment
when
we
say
that
in
hardness
of
heart
and
cruelty
she
is
inferior
to
man
the
woman
who
is
asked
to
arm
herself
and
kill
her
fellow
creatures
will
say
i
cannot
is
this
to
be
considered
a
fault
and
lack
of
qualification
as
mans
equal
yet
be
it
known
that
if
woman
had
been
taught
and
trained
in
the
military
science
of
slaughter
she
would
have
been
the
equivalent
of
man
even
in
this
accomplishment
but
god
forbid
may
woman
never
attain
this
proficiency
may
she
never
wield
weapons
of
war
for
the
destruction
of
humanity
is
not
a
glorious
achievement
the
upbuilding
of
a
home
the
bringing
of
joy
and
comfort
into
human
hearts
are
truly
glories
of
mankind
let
not
a
man
glory
in
this
that
he
can
kill
his
fellow
creatures
nay
rather
let
him
glory
in
this
that
he
can
love
them
when
we
consider
the
kingdoms
of
existence
below
man
we
find
no
distinction
or
estimate
of
superiority
and
inferiority
between
male
and
female
among
the
myriad
organisms
of
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
sex
exists
but
there
is
no
differentiation
whatever
as
to
relative
importance
and
value
in
the
equation
of
life
if
we
investigate
impartially
we
may
even
find
species
in
which
the
female
is
superior
or
preferable
to
the
male
for
instance
there
are
trees
such
as
the
fig
the
male
of
which
is
fruitless
while
the
female
is
fruitful
the
male
of
the
date
palm
is
valueless
while
the
female
bears
abundantly
inasmuch
as
we
find
no
ground
for
distinction
or
superiority
according
to
the
creative
wisdom
in
the
lower
kingdoms
is
it
logical
or
becoming
of
man
to
make
such
distinction
in
regard
to
himself
the
male
of
the
animal
kingdom
does
not
glory
in
its
being
male
and
superior
to
the
female
in
fact
equality
exists
and
is
recognized
why
should
man
a
higher
and
more
intelligent
creature
deny
and
deprive
himself
of
this
equality
the
animals
enjoy
his
surest
index
and
guide
as
to
the
creative
intention
concerning
himself
are
the
conditions
and
analogies
of
the
kingdoms
below
him
where
equality
of
the
sexes
is
fundamental
the
truth
is
that
all
mankind
are
the
creatures
and
servants
of
one
god
and
in
his
estimate
all
are
human
man
is
a
generic
term
applying
to
all
humanity
the
biblical
statement
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
does
not
mean
that
woman
was
not
created
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
apply
to
her
as
well
in
persian
and
arabic
there
are
two
distinct
words
translated
into
english
as
man
one
meaning
man
and
woman
collectively
the
other
distinguishing
man
as
male
from
woman
the
female
the
first
word
and
its
pronoun
are
generic
collective
the
other
is
restricted
to
the
male
this
is
the
same
in
hebrew
to
accept
and
observe
a
distinction
which
god
has
not
intended
in
creation
is
ignorance
and
superstition
the
fact
which
is
to
be
considered
however
is
that
woman
having
formerly
been
deprived
must
now
be
allowed
equal
opportunities
with
man
for
education
and
training
there
must
be
no
difference
in
their
education
until
the
reality
of
equality
between
man
and
woman
is
fully
established
and
attained
the
highest
social
development
of
mankind
is
not
possible
even
granted
that
woman
is
inferior
to
man
in
some
degree
of
capacity
or
accomplishment
this
or
any
other
distinction
would
continue
to
be
productive
of
discord
and
trouble
the
only
remedy
is
education
opportunity
for
equality
means
equal
qualification
in
brief
the
assumption
of
superiority
by
man
will
continue
to
be
depressing
to
the
ambition
of
woman
as
if
her
attainment
to
equality
was
creationally
impossible
womans
aspiration
toward
advancement
will
be
checked
by
it
and
she
will
gradually
become
hopeless
on
the
contrary
we
must
declare
that
her
capacity
is
equal
even
greater
than
mans
this
will
inspire
her
with
hope
and
ambition
and
her
susceptibilities
for
advancement
will
continually
increase
she
must
not
be
told
and
taught
that
she
is
weaker
and
inferior
in
capacity
and
qualification
if
a
pupil
is
told
that
his
intelligence
is
less
than
his
fellow
pupils
it
is
a
very
great
drawback
and
handicap
to
his
progress
he
must
be
encouraged
to
advance
by
the
statement
you
are
most
capable
and
if
you
endeavor
you
will
attain
the
highest
degree
it
is
my
hope
that
the
banner
of
equality
may
be
raised
throughout
the
five
continents
where
as
yet
it
is
not
fully
recognized
and
established
in
this
enlightened
world
of
the
west
woman
has
advanced
an
immeasurable
degree
beyond
the
women
of
the
orient
and
let
it
be
known
once
more
that
until
woman
and
man

notes

when
we
look
upon
the
kingdoms
of
creation
below
man
we
find
three
forms
or
planes
of
existence
which
await
education
and
development
for
instance
the
function
of
a
gardener
is
to
till
the
soil
of
the
mineral
kingdom
and
plant
a
tree
which
under
his
training
and
cultivation
will
attain
perfection
of
growth
if
it
be
wild
and
fruitless
it
may
be
made
fruitful
and
prolific
by
grafting
if
small
and
unsightly
it
will
become
lofty
beautiful
and
verdant
under
the
gardeners
training
whereas
a
tree
bereft
of
his
cultivation
retrogresses
daily
its
fruit
grows
acrid
and
bitter
as
the
trees
of
the
jungle
or
it
may
become
entirely
barren
and
bereft
of
its
fruitage
likewise
we
observe
that
animals
which
have
undergone
training
in
their
sphere
of
limitation
will
progress
and
advance
unmistakably
become
more
beautiful
in
appearance
and
increase
in
intelligence
for
instance
how
intelligent
and
knowing
the
arabian
horse
has
become
through
training
even
how
polite
this
horse
has
become
through
education
as
to
the
human
world
it
is
more
in
need
of
guidance
and
education
than
the
lower
creatures
reflect
upon
the
vast
difference
between
the
inhabitants
of
africa
and
those
of
america
here
the
people
have
been
civilized
and
uplifted
there
they
are
in
the
utmost
and
abject
state
of
savagery
what
is
the
cause
of
their
savagery
and
the
reason
of
your
civilization
it
is
evident
that
this
difference
is
due
to
education
and
the
lack
of
education
consider
then
the
effectiveness
of
education
in
the
human
kingdom
it
makes
the
ignorant
wise
the
tyrant
merciful
the
blind
seeing
the
deaf
attentive
even
the
imbecile
intelligent
how
vast
this
difference
how
wide
the
chasm
which
separates
the
educated
man
from
the
man
who
lacks
teaching
and
training
this
is
the
effect
when
the
teacher
is
merely
an
ordinary
teacher
butpraise
be
to
godyour
teacher
and
instructor
is
bahaullah
he
is
the
educator
of
the
orient
and
occident
he
is
the
teacher
of
the
very
world
of
divinity
and
spirituality
the
sun
of
truth
the
word
of
god
the
lights
of
his
education
are
radiating
even
as
the
sun
see
what
it
has
accomplished
how
it
is
developing
all
humanity
so
that
i
a
persian
have
come
to
this
meeting
of
revered
souls
upon
the
american
continent
and
am
standing
here
expounding
to
you
in
the
greatest
love
this
is
through
the
training
of
bahaullah
which
can
unite
and
has
united
these
hearts
in
this
way
it
has
enlightened
the
world
even
so
it
has
breathed
the
spirit
of
god
into
men
even
so
it
has
resuscitated
the
hearts
of
men
therefore
praise
be
to
god
that
you
have
been
brought
under
the
education
of
this
one
who
is
the
very
sun
of
reality
and
who
is
shining
resplendently
upon
all
humankind
endowing
all
with

this
morning
the
city
is
enveloped
in
fog
and
mist
how
beautiful
is
a
city
brilliant
with
sunshine
just
as
these
mists
and
vapors
conceal
the
phenomenal
sun
so
human
imaginations
obscure
the
sun
of

consider
the
radiant
glory
of
the
great
solar
center
of
our
planetary
system
how
wonderful
the
sight
how
its
splendor
illumines
vision
until
clouds
and
mists
veil
it
from
the
eye
in
the
same
way
the
sun
of

becomes
veiled
and
hidden
by
the
superstitions
and

of
human
minds
when
the

no

haze

we

to
the

points
of
the

of

each
to
a
particular
rising
place
from
which
the
light
of

has
become

but
after
a
time
the
dawning
point
has
become
the
object
of
worship
instead
of
the
sun
itself
which
is
ever
one
sun
and
stationary
in
the
heavens
of
the
divine
will
differences
have
arisen
because
of
this
causing
clouds

to
overshadow
again
the
glorious

when
the

of

are
dispersed
all
will
see
the

then
will
all

inasmuch
as
these

human

hide
the

of

we
must
put
forth
our
utmost

may
we
unite

be

to
accomplish
it
for
the

its

all
the

are

of
the

of
the

none
are
preferred
above

so
likewise
all

the

of
the

none
are

all
are

the

of

until

therefore
make
use
of
intelligence

so
that
you

dispel
these
dense
clouds
from
the
horizon
of
human
hearts
and
all

it

when
we
carefully
investigate
the
kingdoms
of
existence
and
observe
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
about
us
we
discover
the
absolute
order
and
perfection
of
creation
the
dull
minerals
in
their
affinities
plants
and
vegetables
with
power
of
growth
animals
in
their
instinct
man
with
conscious
intellect
and
the
heavenly
orbs
moving
obediently
through
limitless
space
are
all
found
subject
to
universal
law
most
complete
most
perfect
that
is
why
a
wise
philosopher
has
said
there
is
no
greater
or
more
perfect
system
of
creation
than
that
which
already
exists
the
materialists
and
atheists
declare
that
this
order
and
symmetry
is
due
to
nature
and
its
forces
that
composition
and
decomposition
which
constitute
life
and
existence
are
exigencies
of
nature
that
man
himself
is
an
exigency
of
nature
that
nature
rules
and
governs
creation
and
that
all
existing
things
are
captives
of
nature
let
us
consider
these
statements
inasmuch
as
we
find
all
phenomena
subject
to
an
exact
order
and
under
control
of
universal
law
the
question
is
whether
this
is
due
to
nature
or
to
divine
and
omnipotent
rule
the
materialists
believe
that
it
is
an
exigency
of
nature
for
the
rain
to
fall
and
that
unless
rain
fell
the
earth
would
not
become
verdant
they
reason
that
if
clouds
cause
a
downpour
if
the
sun
sends
forth
heat
and
light
and
the
earth
is
endowed
with
capacity
vegetation
must
inevitably
follow
therefore
plant
life
is
a
property
of
these
natural
forces
and
is
a
sign
of
nature
just
as
combustion
is
the
natural
property
of
fire
therefore
fire
burns
and
we
cannot
conceive
of
fire
without
its
burning
in
reply
to
these
statements
we
say
that
from
the
premises
advanced
by
materialists
the
conclusions
are
drawn
that
nature
is
the
ruler
and
governor
of
existence
and
that
all
virtues
and
perfections
are
natural
exigencies
and
outcomes
furthermore
it
follows
that
man
is
but
a
part
or
member
of
that
whereof
nature
is
the
whole
man
possesses
certain
virtues
of
which
nature
is
deprived
he
exercises
volition
nature
is
without
will
for
instance
an
exigency
of
the
sun
is
the
giving
of
light
it
is
controlledit
cannot
do
otherwise
than
radiate
lightbut
it
is
not
volitional
an
exigency
of
the
phenomenon
of
electricity
is
that
it
is
revealed
in
sparks
and
flashes
under
certain
conditions
but
it
cannot
voluntarily
furnish
illumination
an
exigency
or
property
of
water
is
humidity
it
cannot
separate
itself
from
this
property
by
its
own
will
likewise
all
the
properties
of
nature
are
inherent
and
obedient
not
volitional
therefore
it
is
philosophically
predicated
that
nature
is
without
volition
and
innate
perception
in
this
statement
and
principle
we
agree
with
the
materialists
but
the
question
which
presents
food
for
reflection
is
this
how
is
it
that
man
who
is
a
part
of
the
universal
plan
is
possessed
of
certain
qualities
whereof
nature
is
devoid
is
it
conceivable
that
a
drop
should
be
imbued
with
qualities
of
which
the
ocean
is
completely
deprived
the
drop
is
a
part
the
ocean
is
the
whole
could
there
be
a
phenomenon
of
combustion
or
illumination
which
the
great
luminary
the
sun
itself
did
not
manifest
is
it
possible
for
a
stone
to
possess
inherent
properties
of
which
the
aggregate
mineral
kingdom
is
lacking
for
example
could
the
fingernail
which
is
a
part
of
human
anatomy
be
endowed
with
cellular
properties
of
which
the
brain
is
deprived
man
is
intelligent
instinctively
and
consciously
intelligent
nature
is
not
man
is
fortified
with
memory
nature
does
not
possess
it
man
is
the
discoverer
of
the
mysteries
of
nature
nature
is
not
conscious
of
those
mysteries
herself
it
is
evident
therefore
that
man
is
dual
in
aspect
as
an
animal
he
is
subject
to
nature
but
in
his
spiritual
or
conscious
being
he
transcends
the
world
of
material
existence
his
spiritual
powers
being
nobler
and
higher
possess
virtues
of
which
nature
intrinsically
has
no
evidence
therefore
they
triumph
over
natural
conditions
these
ideal
virtues
or
powers
in
man
surpass
or
surround
nature
comprehend
natural
laws
and
phenomena
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
unknown
and
invisible
and
bring
them
forth
into
the
realm
of
the
known
and
visible
all
the
existing
arts
and
sciences
were
once
hidden
secrets
of
nature
by
his
command
and
control
of
nature
man
took
them
out
of
the
plane
of
the
invisible
and
revealed
them
in
the
plane
of
visibility
whereas
according
to
the
exigencies
of
nature
these
secrets
should
have
remained
latent
and
concealed
according
to
the
exigencies
of
nature
electricity
should
be
a
hidden
mysterious
power
but
the
penetrating
intellect
of
man
has
discovered
it
taken
it
out
of
the
realm
of
mystery
and
made
it
an
obedient
human
servant
in
his
physical
body
and
its
functions
man
is
a
captive
of
nature
for
instance
he
cannot
continue
his
existence
without
sleep
an
exigency
of
nature
he
must
partake
of
food
and
drink
which
nature
demands
and
requires
but
in
his
spiritual
being
and
intelligence
man
dominates
and
controls
nature
the
ruler
of
his
physical
being
notwithstanding
this
contrary
opinions
and
materialistic
views
are
set
forth
which
would
relegate
man
completely
to
physical
subservience
to
natures
laws
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
comparative
degree
exceeds
the
superlative
that
the
imperfect
includes
the
perfect
that
the
pupil
surpasses
the
teacherall
of
which
is
illogical
and
impossible
when
it
is
clearly
manifest
and
evident
that
the
intelligence
of
man
his
constructive
faculty
his
power
of
penetration
and
discovery
transcend
nature
how
can
we
say
he
is
natures
thrall
and
captive
this
would
indicate
that
man
is
deprived
of
the
bounties
of
god
that
he
is
retrograding
toward
the
station
of
the
animal
that
his
keen
superintelligence
is
without
function
and
that
he
estimates
himself
as
an
animal
without
distinction
between
his
own
and
the
animals

i
was
once
conversing
with
a
famous
philosopher
of
the
materialistic
school
in
alexandria
he
was
strongly
opinionated
upon
the
point
that
man
and
the
other
kingdoms
of
existence
are
under
the
control
of
nature
and
that
after
all
man
is
only
a
social
animal
often
very
much
of
an
animal
when
he
was
discomfited
in
argument
he
said
impetuously
i
see
no
difference
between
myself
and
the
donkey
and
i
am
not
willing
to
admit
distinctions
which
i
cannot
perceive
abdulbaha
replied
no
i
consider
you
quite
different
and
distinct
i
call
you
a
man
and
the
donkey
but
an
animal
i
perceive
that
you
are
highly
intelligent
whereas
the
donkey
is
not
i
know
that
you
are
well
versed
in
philosophy
and
i
also
know
that
the
donkey
is
entirely
deficient
in
it
therefore
i
am
not
willing
to
accept
your
statement
consider
the
lady
beside
me
who
is
writing
in
this
little
book
it
seems
a
very
trifling
ordinary
matter
but
upon
intelligent
reflection
you
will
conclude
that
what
has
been
written
presupposses
and
proves
the
existence
of
a
writer
these
words
have
not
written
themselves
and
these
letters
have
not
come
together
of
their
own
volition
it
is
evident
there
must
be
a
writer
and
now
consider
this
infinite
universe
is
it
possible
that
it
could
have
been
created
without
a
creator
or
that
the
creator
and
cause
of
this
infinite
congeries
of
worlds
should
be
without
intelligence
is
the
idea
tenable
that
the
creator
has
no
comprehension
of
what
is
manifested
in
creation
man
the
creature
has
volition
and
certain
virtues
is
it
possible
that
his
creator
is
deprived
of
these
a
child
could
not
accept
this
belief
and
statement
it
is
perfectly
evident
that
man
did
not
create
himself
and
that
he
cannot
do
so
how
could
man
of
his
own
weakness
create
such
a
mighty
being
therefore
the
creator
of
man
must
be
more
perfect
and
powerful
than
man
if
the
creative
cause
of
man
be
simply
on
the
same
level
with
man
then
man
himself
should
be
able
to
create
whereas
we
know
very
well
that
we
cannot
create
even
our
own
likeness
therefore
the
creator
of
man
must
be
endowed
with
superlative
intelligence
and
power
in
all
points
that
creation
involves
and
implies
we
are
weak
he
is
mighty
because
were
he
not
mighty
he
could
not
have
created
us
we
are
ignorant
he
is
wise
we
are
poor
he
is
rich
otherwise
he
would
have
been
incapable
of
our
creation
among
the
proofs
of
the
existence
of
a
divine
power
is
this
that
things
are
often
known
by
their
opposites
were
it
not
for
darkness
light
could
not
be
sensed
were
it
not
for
death
life
could
not
be
known
if
ignorance
did
not
exist
knowledge
would
not
be
a
reality
it
is
necessary
that
each
should
exist
in
order
that
the
other
should
have
reality
night
and
day
must
be
in
order
that
each
may
be
distinguished
night
itself
is
an
indication
and
evidence
of
day
which
follows
and
day
itself
indicates
the
coming
night
unless
night
were
a
reality
there
could
not
be
day
were
it
not
for
death
there
could
be
no
life
things
are
known
by
their
opposites
therefore
our
weakness
is
an
evidence
that
there
is
might
our
ignorance
proves
the
reality
of
knowledge
our
need
is
an
indication
of
supply
and
wealth
were
it
not
for
wealth
this
need
would
not
exist
were
it
not
for
knowledge
ignorance
would
be
unknown
were
it
not
for
power
there
would
be
no
impotence
in
other
words
demand
and
supply
is
the
law
and
undoubtedly
all
virtues
have
a
center
and
source
that
source
is

may
it
be
the
cause
of
great
illumination
in
the
occident
in
this
western
world
with
its
stimulating
climate
its
capacities
for
knowledge
and
lofty
ideals
the
message
of
peace
should
be
easily
spread
the
people
are
not
so
influenced
by
imitations
and
prejudices
and
through
their
comprehension
of
the
real
and
unreal
they
should
attain
the
truth
they
should
become
leaders
in
the
effort
to
establish
the
oneness
of
humankind
what
is
higher
than
this
responsibility
in
the
kingdom
of
god
no
service
is
greater
and
in
the
estimation
of
the
prophets
including
jesus
christ
there
is
no
deed
so
estimable
yet
even
now
warfare
prevails
envy
and
hatred
have
arisen
between
nations
but
because
i
find
the
american
nation
so
capable
of
achievement
and
this
government
the
fairest
of
western
governments
its
institutions
superior
to
others
my
wish
and
hope
is
that
the
banner
of
international
reconciliation
may
first
be
raised
on
this
continent
and
the
standard
of
the
most
great
peace
be
unfurled
here
may
the
american
people
and
their
government
unite
in
their
efforts
in
order
that
this
light
may
dawn
from
this
point
and
spread
to
all
regions
for
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
bestowals
of
god
in
order
that
america
may
avail
herself
of
this
opportunity
i
beg
that
you
strive
and
pray
with
heart
and
soul
devoting
all
your
energies
to
this
end
that
the
banner
of
international
peace
may
be
upraised
here
and
that
this
democracy
may
be
the
cause
of
the
cessation
of

notes
by
marzieh
moss
according
to
the
statement
of
philosophers
the
difference
in
degree
of
humankind
from
lowest
to
highest
is
due
to
education
the
proofs
they
advance
are
these
the
civilization
of
europe
and
america
is
an
evidence
and
outcome
of
education
whereas
the
semicivilized
and
barbarous
peoples
of
africa
bear
witness
in
their
condition
that
they
have
been
deprived
of
its
advantages
education
makes
the
ignorant
wise
the
tyrant
just
promotes
happiness
strengthens
the
mind
develops
the
will
and
makes
fruitless
trees
of
humanity
fruitful
therefore
in
the
human
world
some
have
attained
lofty
degrees
while
others
grope
in
the
abyss
of
despair
nevertheless
the
highest
attainment
is
possible
for
every
member
of
the
human
race
even
to
the
station
of
the
prophets
this
is
the
statement
and
reasoning
of
the
philosophers
the
prophets
of
god
are
the
first
educators
they
bestow
universal
education
upon
man
and
cause
him
to
rise
from
the
lowest
levels
of
savagery
to
the
highest
pinnacles
of
spiritual
development
the
philosophers
too
are
educators
along
lines
of
intellectual
training
at
most
they
have
only
been
able
to
educate
themselves
and
a
limited
number
about
them
to
improve
their
own
morals
and
so
to
speak
civilize
themselves
but
they
have
been
incapable
of
universal
education
they
have
failed
to
cause
an
advancement
for
any
given
nation
from
savagery
to
civilization
it
is
evident
that
although
education
improves
the
morals
of
mankind
confers
the
advantages
of
civilization
and
elevates
man
from
lowest
degrees
to
the
station
of
sublimity
there
is
nevertheless
a
difference
in
the
intrinsic
or
natal
capacity
of
individuals
ten
children
of
the
same
age
with
equal
station
of
birth
taught
in
the
same
school
partaking
of
the
same
food
in
all
respects
subject
to
the
same
environment
their
interests
equal
and
in
common
will
evidence
separate
and
distinct
degrees
of
capability
and
advancement
some
will
be
exceedingly
intelligent
and
progressive
some
of
mediocre
ability
others
limited
and
incapable
one
may
become
a
learned
professor
while
another
under
the
same
course
of
education
proves
dull
and
stupid
from
all
standpoints
the
opportunities
have
been
equal
but
the
results
and
outcomes
vary
from
the
highest
to
lowest
degree
of
advancement
it
is
evident
therefore
that
mankind
differs
in
natal
capacity
and
intrinsic
intellectual
endowment
nevertheless
although
capacities
are
not
the
same
every
member
of
the
human
race
is
capable
of
education
jesus
christ
was
an
educator
of
humanity
his
teachings
were
altruistic
his
bestowal
universal
he
taught
mankind
by
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
and
not
through
human
agency
for
the
human
power
is
limited
whereas
the
divine
power
is
illimitable
and
infinite
the
influence
and
accomplishment
of
christ
will
attest
this
galen
the
greek
physician
and
philosopher
who
lived
in
the
second
century
ad
wrote
a
treatise
upon
the
civilization
of
nations
he
was
not
a
christian
but
he
bore
testimony
that
religious
beliefs
exercise
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
the
problems
of
civilization
in
substance
he
said
there
are
certain
people
among
us
followers
of
jesus
the
nazarene
who
was
killed
in
jerusalem
these
people
are
truly
imbued
with
moral
principles
which
are
the
envy
of
philosophers
they
believe
in
god
and
fear
him
they
have
hopes
in
his
favors
therefore
they
shun
all
unworthy
deeds
and
actions
and
incline
to
praiseworthy
ethics
and
morals
day
and
night
they
strive
that
their
deeds
may
be
commendable
and
that
they
may
contribute
to
the
welfare
of
humanity
therefore
each
one
of
them
is
virtually
a
philosopher
for
these
people
have
attained
unto
that
which
is
the
essence
and
purport
of
philosophy
these
people
have
praiseworthy
morals
even
though
they
may
be
illiterate
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
show
that
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
the
divine
prophets
are
the
first
teachers
of
the
human
race
they
are
universal
educators
and
the
fundamental
principles
they
have
laid
down
are
the
causes
and
factors
of
the
advancement
of
nations
forms
and
imitations
which
creep
in
afterward
are
not
conducive
to
that
progress
on
the
contrary
these
are
destroyers
of
human
foundations
established
by
the
heavenly
educators
these
are
clouds
which
obscure
the
sun
of
reality
if
you
reflect
upon
the
essential
teachings
of
jesus
you
will
realize
that
they
are
the
light
of
the
world
nobody
can
question
their
truth
they
are
the
very
source
of
life
and
the
cause
of
happiness
to
the
human
race
the
forms
and
superstitions
which
appeared
and
obscured
the
light
did
not
affect
the
reality
of
christ
for
example
jesus
christ
said
put
up
thy
sword
into
the
sheath
the
meaning
is
that
warfare
is
forbidden
and
abrogated
but
consider
the
christian
wars
which
took
place
afterward
christian
hostility
and
inquisition
spared
not
even
the
learned
he
who
proclaimed
the
revolution
of
the
earth
was
imprisoned
he
who
announced
the
new
astronomical
system
was
persecuted
as
a
heretic
scholars
and
scientists
became
objects
of
fanatical
hatred
and
many
were
killed
and
tortured
how
do
these
actions
conform
with
the
teachings
of
jesus
christ
and
what
relation
do
they
bear
to
his
own
example
for
christ
declared
love
your
enemies
and
pray
for
them
which
persecute
you
that
you
may
be
the
children
of
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
for
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good
and
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
how
can
hatred
hostility
and
persecution
be
reconciled
with
christ
and
his
teachings
therefore
there
is
need
of
turning
back
to
the
original
foundation
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
prophets
are
correct
and
true
the
imitations
and
superstitions
which
have
crept
in
are
at
wide
variance
with
the
original
precepts
and
commands
bahaullah
has
revoiced
and
reestablished
the
quintessence
of
the
teachings
of
all
the
prophets
setting
aside
the
accessories
and
purifying
religion
from
human
interpretation
he
has
written
a
book
entitled
the
hidden
words
the
preface
announces
that
it
contains
the
essences
of
the
words
of
the
prophets
of
the
past
clothed
in
the
garment
of
brevity
for
the
teaching
and
spiritual
guidance
of
the
people
of
the
world
read
it
that
you
may
understand
the
true
foundations
of
religion
and
reflect
upon
the
inspiration
of
the
messengers
of
god
it
is
light
upon
light
we
must
not
look
for
truth
in
the
deeds
and
actions
of
nations
we
must
investigate
truth
at
its
divine
source
and
summon
all
mankind
to
unity
in
reality
itself

notes
by
marzieh
moss
i
am
very
happy
in
being
present
at
this
meeting
praise
be
to
god
i
see
before
me
the
faces
of
those
who
are
endowed
with
capacity
to
know
and
who
desire
to
investigate
truth
this
is
conducive
to
the
greatest
joy
according
to
divine
philosophy
there
are
two
important
and
universal
conditions
in
the
world
of
material
phenomena
one
which
concerns
life
the
other
concerning
death
one
relative
to
existence
the
other
nonexistence
one
manifest
in
composition
the
other
in
decomposition
some
define
existence
as
the
expression
of
reality
or
being
and
nonexistence
as
nonbeing
imagining
that
death
is
annihilation
this
is
a
mistaken
idea
for
total
annihilation
is
an
impossibility
at
most
composition
is
ever
subject
to
decomposition
or
disintegrationthat
is
to
say
existence
implies
the
grouping
of
material
elements
in
a
form
or
body
and
nonexistence
is
simply
the
decomposing
of
these
groupings
this
is
the
law
of
creation
in
its
endless
forms
and
infinite
variety
of
expression
certain
elements
have
formed
the
composite
creature
man
this
composite
association
of
the
elements
in
the
form
of
a
human
body
is
therefore
subject
to
disintegration
which
we
call
death
but
after
disintegration
the
elements
themselves
persist
unchanged
therefore
total
annihilation
is
an
impossibility
and
existence
can
never
become
nonexistence
this
would
be
equivalent
to
saying
that
light
can
become
darkness
which
is
manifestly
untrue
and
impossible
as
existence
can
never
become
nonexistence
there
is
no
death
for
man
nay
rather
man
is
everlasting
and
everliving
the
rational
proof
of
this
is
that
the
atoms
of
the
material
elements
are
transferable
from
one
form
of
existence
to
another
from
one
degree
and
kingdom
to
another
lower
or
higher
for
example
an
atom
of
the
soil
or
dust
of
earth
may
traverse
the
kingdoms
from
mineral
to
man
by
successive
incorporations
into
the
bodies
of
the
organisms
of
those
kingdoms
at
one
time
it
enters
into
the
formation
of
the
mineral
or
rock
it
is
then
absorbed
by
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
becomes
a
constituent
of
the
body
and
fibre
of
a
tree
again
it
is
appropriated
by
the
animal
and
at
a
still
later
period
is
found
in
the
body
of
man
throughout
these
degrees
of
its
traversing
the
kingdoms
from
one
form
of
phenomenal
being
to
another
it
retains
its
atomic
existence
and
is
never
annihilated
nor
relegated
to
nonexistence
nonexistence
therefore
is
an
expression
applied
to
change
of
form
but
this
transformation
can
never
be
rightly
considered
annihilation
for
the
elements
of
composition
are
ever
present
and
existent
as
we
have
seen
in
the
journey
of
the
atom
through
successive
kingdoms
unimpaired
hence
there
is
no
death
life
is
everlasting
so
to
speak
when
the
atom
entered
into
the
composition
of
the
tree
it
died
to
the
mineral
kingdom
and
when
consumed
by
the
animal
it
died
to
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
so
on
until
its
transference
or
transmutation
into
the
kingdom
of
man
but
throughout
its
traversing
it
was
subject
to
transformation
and
not
annihilation
death
therefore
is
applicable
to
a
change
or
transference
from
one
degree
or
condition
to
another
in
the
mineral
realm
there
was
a
spirit
of
existence
in
the
world
of
plant
life
and
organisms
it
reappeared
as
the
vegetative
spirit
thence
it
attained
the
animal
spirit
and
finally
aspired
to
the
human
spirit
these
are
degrees
and
changes
but
not
obliteration
and
this
is
a
rational
proof
that
man
is
everlasting
everliving
therefore
death
is
only
a
relative
term
implying
change
for
example
we
will
say
that
this
light
before
me
having
reappeared
in
another
incandescent
lamp
has
died
in
the
one
and
lives
in
the
other
this
is
not
death
in
reality
the
perfections
of
the
mineral
are
translated
into
the
vegetable
and
from
thence
into
the
animal
the
virtue
always
attaining
a
superlative
degree
in
the
upward
change
in
each
kingdom
we
find
the
same
virtues
manifesting
themselves
more
fully
proving
that
the
reality
has
been
transferred
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
form
and
kingdom
of
being
therefore
nonexistence
is
only
relative
and
absolute
nonexistence
inconceivable
this
rose
in
my
hand
will
become
disintegrated
and
its
symmetry
destroyed
but
the
elements
of
its
composition
remain
changeless
nothing
affects
their
elemental
integrity
they
cannot
become
nonexistent
they
are
simply
transferred
from
one
state
to
another
through
his
ignorance
man
fears
death
but
the
death
he
shrinks
from
is
imaginary
and
absolutely
unreal
it
is
only
human
imagination
the
bestowal
and
grace
of
god
have
quickened
the
realm
of
existence
with
life
and
being
for
existence
there
is
neither
change
nor
transformation
existence
is
ever
existence
it
can
never
be
translated
into
nonexistence
it
is
gradation
a
degree
below
a
higher
degree
is
considered
as
nonexistence
this
dust
beneath
our
feet
as
compared
with
our
being
is
nonexistent
when
the
human
body
crumbles
into
dust
we
can
say
it
has
become
nonexistent
therefore
its
dust
in
relation
to
living
forms
of
human
being
is
as
nonexistent
but
in
its
own
sphere
it
is
existent
it
has
its
mineral
being
therefore
it
is
well
proved
that
absolute
nonexistence
is
impossible
it
is
only
relative
the
purpose
is
this
that
the
everlasting
bestowal
of
god
vouchsafed
to
man
is
never
subject
to
corruption
inasmuch
as
he
has
endowed
the
phenomenal
world
with
being
it
is
impossible
for
that
world
to
become
nonbeing
for
it
is
the
very
genesis
of
god
it
is
in
the
realm
of
origination
it
is
a
creational
and
not
a
subjective
world
and
the
bounty
descending
upon
it
is
continuous
and
permanent
therefore
man
the
highest
creature
of
the
phenomenal
world
is
endowed
with
that
continuous
bounty
bestowed
by
divine
generosity
without
cessation
for
instance
the
rays
of
the
sun
are
continuous
the
heat
of
the
sun
emanates
from
it
without
cessation
no
discontinuance
of
it
is
conceivable
even
so
the
bestowal
of
god
is
descending
upon
the
world
of
humanity
never
ceasing
continuous
forever
if
we
say
that
the
bestowal
of
existence
ceases
or
falters
it
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
sun
can
exist
with
cessation
of
its
effulgence
is
this
possible
therefore
the
effulgences
of
existence
are
ever
present
and
continuous
the
conception
of
annihilation
is
a
factor
in
human
degradation
a
cause
of
human
debasement
and
lowliness
a
source
of
human
fear
and
abjection
it
has
been
conducive
to
the
dispersion
and
weakening
of
human
thought
whereas
the
realization
of
existence
and
continuity
has
upraised
man
to
sublimity
of
ideals
established
the
foundations
of
human
progress
and
stimulated
the
development
of
heavenly
virtues
therefore
it
behooves
man
to
abandon
thoughts
of
nonexistence
and
death
which
are
absolutely
imaginary
and
see
himself
everliving
everlasting
in
the
divine
purpose
of
his
creation
he
must
turn
away
from
ideas
which
degrade
the
human
soul
so
that
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
he
may
advance
upward
and
higher
to
spiritual
perception
of
the
continuity
of
the
human
reality
if
he
dwells
upon
the
thought
of
nonexistence
he
will
become
utterly
incompetent
with
weakened
willpower
his
ambition
for
progress
will
be
lessened
and
the
acquisition
of
human
virtues
will
cease
therefore
you
must
thank
god
that
he
has
bestowed
upon
you
the
blessing
of
life
and
existence
in
the
human
kingdom
strive
diligently
to
acquire
virtues
befitting
your
degree
and
station
be
as
lights
of
the
world
which
cannot
be
hid
and
which
have
no
setting
in
horizons
of
darkness
ascend
to
the
zenith
of
an
existence
which
is
never
beclouded
by
the
fears
and
forebodings
of
nonexistence
when
man
is
not
endowed
with
inner
perception
he
is
not
informed
of
these
important
mysteries
the
retina
of
outer
vision
though
sensitive
and
delicate
may
nevertheless
be
a
hindrance
to
the
inner
eye
which
alone
can
perceive
the
bestowals
of
god
which
are
manifest
in
all
phenomenal
life
are
sometimes
hidden
by
intervening
veils
of
mental
and
mortal
vision
which
render
man
spiritually
blind
and
incapable
but
when
those
scales
are
removed
and
the
veils
rent
asunder
then
the
great
signs
of
god
will
become
visible
and
he
will
witness
the
eternal
light
filling
the
world
the
bestowals
of
god
are
all
and
always
manifest
the
promises
of
heaven
are
ever
present
the
favors
of
god
are
allsurrounding
but
should
the
conscious
eye
of
the
soul
of
man
remain
veiled
and
darkened
he
will
be
led
to
deny
these
universal
signs
and
remain
deprived
of
these
manifestations
of
divine
bounty
therefore
we
must
endeavor
with
heart
and
soul
in
order
that
the
veil
covering
the
eye
of
inner
vision
may
be
removed
that
we
may
behold
the
manifestations
of
the
signs
of
god
discern
his
mysterious
graces
and
realize
that
material
blessings
as
compared
with
spiritual
bounties
are
as
nothing
the
spiritual
blessings
of
god
are
greatest
when
we
were
in
the
mineral
kingdom
although
we
were
endowed
with
certain
gifts
and
powers
they
were
not
to
be
compared
with
the
blessings
of
the
human
kingdom
in
the
matrix
of
the
mother
we
were
the
recipients
of
endowments
and
blessings
of
god
yet
these
were
as
nothing
compared
to
the
powers
and
graces
bestowed
upon
us
after
birth
into
this
human
world
likewise
if
we
are
born
from
the
matrix
of
this
physical
and
phenomenal
environment
into
the
freedom
and
loftiness
of
the
spiritual
life
and
vision
we
shall
consider
this
mortal
existence
and
its
blessings
as
worthless
by
comparison
in
the
spiritual
world
the
divine
bestowals
are
infinite
for
in
that
realm
there
is
neither
separation
nor
disintegration
which
characterize
the
world
of
material
existence
spiritual
existence
is
absolute
immortality
completeness
and
unchangeable
being
therefore
we
must
thank
god
that
he
has
created
for
us
both
material
blessings
and
spiritual
bestowals
he
has
given
us
material
gifts
and
spiritual
graces
outer
sight
to
view
the
lights
of
the
sun
and
inner
vision
by
which
we
may
perceive
the
glory
of
god
he
has
designed
the
outer
ear
to
enjoy
the
melodies
of
sound
and
the
inner
hearing
wherewith
we
may
hear
the
voice
of
our
creator
we
must
strive
with
energies
of
heart
soul
and
mind
to
develop
and
manifest
the
perfections
and
virtues
latent
within
the
realities
of
the
phenomenal
world
for
the
human
reality
may
be
compared
to
a
seed
if
we
sow
the
seed
a
mighty
tree
appears
from
it
the
virtues
of
the
seed
are
revealed
in
the
tree
it
puts
forth
branches
leaves
blossoms
and
produces
fruits
all
these
virtues
were
hidden
and
potential
in
the
seed
through
the
blessing
and
bounty
of
cultivation
these
virtues
became
apparent
similarly
the
merciful
god
our
creator
has
deposited
within
human
realities
certain
latent
and
potential
virtues
through
education
and
culture
these
virtues
deposited
by
the
loving
god
will
become
apparent
in
the
human
reality
even
as
the
unfoldment
of
the
tree
from
within
the
germinating
seed
i
will
pray
for
you
o
thou
kind
lord
these
are
thy
servants
who
have
gathered
in
this
meeting

turned

and
unfold
the
virtues
which
thou
hast
made
latent
and
concealed
in
these
human
realities
o
god
we
are
as

and
thy
bounty
is
as

and
cause
these
plants
to
grow
through
thy
bestowal

from
the

notes
by

moss
you
are
the
children
of
whom
christ
has
said
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
god
and
according
to
the
words
of
bahaullah
you
are
the
very
lamps
or
candles
of
the
world
of
humanity
for
your
hearts
are
exceedingly
pure
and
your
spirits
most
sensitive
you
are
near
the
source
you
have
not
yet
become
contaminated
you
are
the
lambs
of
the
heavenly
shepherd
you
are
as
polished
mirrors
reflecting
pure
light
my
hope
is
that
your
parents
may
educate
you
spiritually
and
give
you
thorough
moral
training
may
you
develop
so
that
each
one
of
you
shall
become
imbued
with
all
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
may
you
advance
in
all
material
and
spiritual
degrees
may
you
become
learned
in
sciences
acquire
the
arts
and
crafts
prove
to
be
useful
members
of
human
society
and
assist
the
progress
of
human
civilization
may
you
be
a
cause
of
the
manifestation
of
divine
bestowalseach
one
of
you
a
shining
star
radiating
the
light
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
toward
the
horizons
of
the
east
and
west
may
you
be
devoted
to
the
love
and
unity
of
mankind
and
through
your
efforts
may
the
reality
deposited
in
the
human
heart
find
its
divine
expression
i
pray
for
you
asking
the
assistance
and
confirmation
of
god
in
your
behalf
you
are
all
my
children
my
spiritual
children
spiritual
children
are
dearer
than
physical
children
for
it
is
possible
for
physical
children
to
turn
away
from
the
spirit
of
god
but
you
are
spiritual
children
and
therefore
you
are
most
beloved
i
wish
for
you
progress
in
every
degree
of
development
may
god
assist
you
may
you
be
surrounded
by
the
beneficent
light
of
his
countenance
and
may
you
attain
maturity
under
his
nurture
and
protection
you
are
all
blessed
to
the
friends
i
am
going
away
but
you
must
arise
to
serve
the
word
of
god
your
hearts
must
be
pure
and
your
intentions
sincere
in
order
that
you
may
become
recipients
of
the
divine
bestowals
consider
that
although
the
sun
shines
equally
upon
all
things
yet
in
the
clear
mirror
its
reflection
is
most
brilliant
and
not
in
the
black
stone
this
great
effulgence
and
heat
have
been
produced
by
the
crystal
clearness
of
the
glass
if
there
were
no
clearness
and
purity
these
effects
would
not
be
witnessed
should
rain
fall
upon
salty
stony
earth
it
will
never
have
effect
but
when
it
falls
upon
good
pure
soil
green
and
verdant
growth
follows
and
fruits
are
produced
this
is
the
day
when
pure
hearts
have
a
portion
of
the
everlasting
bounties
and
sanctified
souls
are
being
illumined
by
the
eternal
manifestations
praise
be
to
god
you
are
believers
in
god
assured
by
the
words
of
god
and
turning
to
the
kingdom
of
god
you
have
heard
the
divine
call
your
hearts
are
moved
by
the
breezes
of
the
paradise
of
abha
you
have
good
intentions
your
purpose
is
the
good
pleasure
of
god
you
desire
to
serve
in
the
kingdom
of
the
merciful
one
therefore
arise
in
the
utmost
power
be
in
perfect
unity
never
become
angry
with
one
another
let
your
eyes
be
directed
toward
the
kingdom
of
truth
and
not
toward
the
world
of
creation
love
the
creatures
for
the
sake
of
god
and
not
for
themselves
you
will
never
become
angry
or
impatient
if
you
love
them
for
the
sake
of
god
humanity
is
not
perfect
there
are
imperfections
in
every
human
being
and
you
will
always
become
unhappy
if
you
look
toward
the
people
themselves
but
if
you
look
toward
god
you
will
love
them
and
be
kind
to
them
for
the
world
of
god
is
the
world
of
perfection
and
complete
mercy
therefore
do
not
look
at
the
shortcomings
of
anybody
see
with
the
sight
of
forgiveness
the
imperfect
eye
beholds
imperfections
the
eye
that
covers
faults
looks
toward
the
creator
of
souls
he
created
them
trains
and
provides
for
them
endows
them
with
capacity
and
life
sight
and
hearing
therefore
they
are
the
signs
of
his
grandeur
you
must
love
and
be
kind
to
everybody
care
for
the
poor
protect
the
weak
heal
the
sick
teach
and
educate
the
ignorant
it
is
my
hope
that
the
unity
and
harmony
of
the
friends
in
chicago
may
be
the
cause
of
the
unity
of
the
friends
throughout
america
and
that
all
people
may
become
recipients
of
their
love
and
kindness
may
they
be
an
example
for
mankind
then
the
confirmations
of
the
kingdom
of
abha
and
the
bestowals
of
the
sun
of

will
be
allencircling

notes
by
marzieh
moss
i
offer
thanks
to
god
for
the
privilege
of
being
present
in
an
assemblage
which
is
commemorating
him
whose
members
have
no
thought
or
intention
save
his
good
pleasure
and
the
unbiased
investigation
of
reality
i
praise
god
for
this
meeting
of
human
souls
free
from
the
bondage
of
imitations
and
prejudice
willing
to
examine
reasonably
and
accept
that
which
is
found
to
be
true
in
our
solar
system
the
center
of
illumination
is
the
sun
itself
through
the
will
of
god
this
central
luminary
is
the
one
source
of
the
existence
and
development
of
all
phenomenal
things
when
we
observe
the
organisms
of
the
material
kingdoms
we
find
that
their
growth
and
training
are
dependent
upon
the
heat
and
light
of
the
sun
without
this
quickening
impulse
there
would
be
no
growth
of
tree
or
vegetation
neither
would
the
existence
of
animal
or
human
being
be
possible
in
fact
no
forms
of
created
life
would
be
manifest
upon
the
earth
but
if
we
reflect
deeply
we
will
perceive
that
the
great
bestower
and
giver
of
life
is
god
the
sun
is
the
intermediary
of
his
will
and
plan
without
the
bounty
of
the
sun
therefore
the
world
would
be
in
darkness
all
illumination
of
our
planetary
system
proceeds
or
emanates
from
the
solar
center
likewise
in
the
spiritual
realm
of
intelligence
and
idealism
there
must
be
a
center
of
illumination
and
that
center
is
the
everlasting
evershining
sun
the
word
of
god
its
lights
are
the
lights
of
reality
which
have
shone
upon
humanity
illumining
the
realm
of
thought
and
morals
conferring
the
bounties
of
the
divine
world
upon
man
these
lights
are
the
cause
of
the
education
of
souls
and
the
source
of
the
enlightenment
of
hearts
sending
forth
in
effulgent
radiance
the
message
of
the
glad
tidings
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
brief
the
moral
and
ethical
world
and
the
world
of
spiritual
regeneration
are
dependent
for
their
progressive
being
upon
that
heavenly
center
of
illumination
it
gives
forth
the
light
of
religion
and
bestows
the
life
of
the
spirit
imbues
humanity
with
archetypal
virtues
and
confers
eternal
splendors
this
sun
of
reality
this
center
of
effulgences
is
the
prophet
or
manifestation
of
god
just
as
the
phenomenal
sun
shines
upon
the
material
world
producing
life
and
growth
likewise
the
spiritual
or
prophetic
sun
confers
illumination
upon
the
human
world
of
thought
and
intelligence
and
unless
it
rose
upon
the
horizon
of
human
existence
the
kingdom
of
man
would
become
dark
and
extinguished
the
sun
of
reality
is
one
sun
but
it
has
different
dawning
places
just
as
the
phenomenal
sun
is
one
although
it
appears
at
various
points
of
the
horizon
during
the
time
of
summer
the
luminary
of
the
physical
world
rises
far
to
the
north
of
the
equinoctial
in
spring
and
fall
it
dawns
midway
and
in
winter
it
appears
in
the
most
southerly
point
of
its
zodiacal
journey
these
daysprings
or
dawning
points
differ
widely
but
the
sun
is
ever
the
same
sunwhether
it
be
the
phenomenal
or
spiritual
luminary
souls
who
focus
their
vision
upon
the
sun
of
reality
will
be
the
recipients
of
light
no
matter
from
what
point
it
rises
but
those
who
are
fettered
by
adoration
of
the
dawning
point
are
deprived
when
it
appears
in
a
different
station
upon
the
spiritual
horizon
furthermore
just
as
the
solar
cycle
has
its
four
seasons
the
cycle
of
the
sun
of
reality
has
its
distinct
and
successive
periods
each
brings
its
vernal
season
or
springtime
when
the
sun
of
reality
returns
to
quicken
the
world
of
mankind
a
divine
bounty
descends
from
the
heaven
of
generosity
the
realm
of
thoughts
and
ideals
is
set
in
motion
and
blessed
with
new
life
minds
are
developed
hopes
brighten
aspirations
become
spiritual
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
appear
with
freshened
power
of
growth
and
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
become
visible
in
man
it
is
the
springtime
of
the
inner
world
after
the
spring
summer
comes
with
its
fullness
and
spiritual
fruitage
autumn
follows
with
its
withering
winds
which
chill
the
soul
the
sun
seems
to
be
going
away
until
at
last
the
mantle
of
winter
overspreads
and
only
faint
traces
of
the
effulgence
of
that
divine
sun
remain
just
as
the
surface
of
the
material
world
becomes
dark
and
dreary
the
soil
dormant
the
trees
naked
and
bare
and
no
beauty
or
freshness
remains
to
cheer
the
darkness
and
desolation
so
the
winter
of
the
spiritual
cycle
witnesses
the
death
and
disappearance
of
divine
growth
and
extinction
of
the
light
and
love
of
god
but
again
the
cycle
begins
and
a
new
springtime
appears
in
it
the
former
springtime
has
returned
the
world
is
resuscitated
illumined
and
attains
spirituality
religion
is
renewed
and
reorganized
hearts
are
turned
to
god
the
summons
of
god
is
heard
and
life
is
again
bestowed
upon
man
for
a
long
time
the
religious
world
had
been
weakened
and
materialism
had
advanced
the
spiritual
forces
of
life
were
waning
moralities
were
becoming
degraded
composure
and
peace
had
vanished
from
souls
and
satanic
qualities
were
dominating
hearts
strife
and
hatred
overshadowed
humanity
bloodshed
and
violence
prevailed
god
was
neglected
the
sun
of
reality
seemed
to
have
gone
completely
deprivation
of
the
bounties
of
heaven
was
a
fact
and
so
the
season
of
winter
fell
upon
mankind
but
in
the
generosity
of
god
a
new
springtime
dawned
the
lights
of
god
shone
forth
the
effulgent
sun
of
reality
returned
and
became
manifest
the
realm
of
thoughts
and
kingdom
of
hearts
became
exhilarated
a
new
spirit
of
life
breathed
into
the
body
of
the
world
and
continuous
advancement
became
apparent
i
hope
that
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
reality
will
illumine
the
whole
world
so
that
no
strife
and
warfare
no
battles
and
bloodshed
remain
may
fanaticism
and
religious
bigotry
be
unknown
all
humanity
enter
the
bond
of
brotherhood
souls
consort
in
perfect
agreement
the
nations
of
earth
at
last
hoist
the
banner
of
truth
and
the
religions
of
the
world
enter
the
divine
temple
of
oneness
for
the
foundations
of
the
heavenly
religions
are
one
reality
reality
is
not
divisible
it
does
not
admit
multiplicity
all
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
have
proclaimed
and
promulgated
the
same
reality
they
have
summoned
mankind
to
reality
itself
and
reality
is
one
the
clouds
and
mists
of
imitations
have
obscured
the
sun
of
truth
we
must
forsake
these
imitations
dispel
these
clouds
and
mists
and
free
the
sun
from
the
darkness
of
superstition

all
the

will
reconcile
all
nationalities
will
flow
together
in

all
degrees
of

will

under

until
the
heavenly
civilization
is
founded
no
result
will
be

from
material
civilization
even
as
you
observe
see
what
catastrophes
overwhelm
mankind
consider
the
wars
which
disturb
the
world
consider
the
enmity
and
hatred
the
existence
of
these

and
conditions
indicates
and
proves
that
the
heavenly
civilization
has
not
yet
been
established
if
the
civilization
of
the
kingdom
be
spread
to
all
the
nations
this
dust
of
disagreement
will
be
dispelled
these
clouds
will
pass
away
and
the
sun
of
reality
in
its

notes
by
marzieh
moss
the
divine
religions
were
founded
for
the
purpose
of
unifying
humanity
and
establishing
universal
peace
any
movement
which
brings
about
peace
and
agreement
in
human
society
is
truly
a
divine
movement
any
reform
which
causes
people
to
come
together
under
the
shelter
of
the
same
tabernacle
is
surely
animated
by
heavenly
motives
at
all
times
and
in
all
ages
of
the
world
religion
has
been
a
factor
in
cementing
together
the
hearts
of
men
and
in
uniting
various
and
divergent
creeds
it
is
the
peace
element
in
religion
that
blends
mankind
and
makes
for
unity
warfare
has
ever
been
the
cause
of
separation
disunion
and
discord
consider
how
jesus
christ
united
the
divergent
peoples
sects
and
denominations
of
the
early
days
it
is
evident
that
the
fundamentals
of
religion
are
intended
to
unify
and
bind
together
their
purpose
is
universal
everlasting
peace
prior
to
the
time
of
jesus
christ
the
word
of
god
had
unified
opposite
types
and
conflicting
elements
of
human
society
and
since
his
appearance
the
divine
teachers
of
the
primal
principles
of
the
law
of
god
have
all
intended
this
universal
outcome
in
persia
bahaullah
was
able
to
unite
people
of
varying
thought
creed
and
denomination
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
were
christians
muslims
jews
zoroastrians
and
a
great
variety
of
subdivided
forms
and
beliefs
together
with
racial
distinctions
such
as
semitic
arabic
persian
turk
etc
but
through
the
power
and
efficacy
of
religion
bahaullah
united
these
differing
peoples
and
caused
them
to
consort
together
in
perfect
agreement
such
unity
and
accord
became
manifest
among
them
that
they
were
considered
as
one
people
and
one
kind
the
cause
of
this
fellowship
and
unity
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
divine
law
has
two
distinct
aspects
or
functions
one
the
essential
or
fundamental
the
other
the
material
or
accidental
the
first
aspect
of
the
revealed
religion
of
god
is
that
which
concerns
the
ethical
development
and
spiritual
progress
of
mankind
the
awakening
of
potential
human
susceptibilities
and
the
descent
of
divine
bestowals
these
ordinances
are
changeless
essential
eternal
the
second
function
of
the
divine
religion
deals
with
material
conditions
the
laws
of
human
intercourse
and
social
regulation
these
are
subject
to
change
and
transformation
in
accordance
with
the
time
place
and
conditions
the
essential
ordinances
of
religion
were
the
same
during
the
time
of
abraham
the
day
of
moses
and
the
cycle
of
jesus
but
the
accidental
or
material
laws
were
abrogated
and
superseded
according
to
the
exigency
and
requirement
of
each
succeeding
age
for
example
in
the
law
of
moses
there
were
ten
distinct
commandments
in
regard
to
murder
which
were
revealed
according
to
the
requirement
and
capacity
of
the
people
but
in
the
day
of
jesus
these
were
abrogated
and
superseded
in
conformity
with
the
changed
and
advanced
human
conditions
the
central
purpose
of
the
divine
religions
is
the
establishment
of
peace
and
unity
among
mankind
their
reality
is
one
therefore
their
accomplishment
is
one
and
universalwhether
it
be
through
the
essential
or
material
ordinances
of
god
there
is
but
one
light
of
the
material
sun
one
ocean
one
rain
one
atmosphere
similarly
in
the
spiritual
world
there
is
one
divine
reality
forming
the
center
and
altruistic
basis
for
peace
and
reconciliation
among
various
and
conflicting
nations
and
peoples
consider
how
the
roman
empire
and
greek
nation
were
at
war
in
enmity
and
hatred
after
the
messianic
day
how
the
hostilities
of
egypt
and
assyria
though
subdued
in
intensity
still
flamed
in
the
warring
element
of
these
ancient
and
declining
nations
but
the
teachings
of
jesus
christ
proved
to
be
the
cement
by
which
they
were
united
warfare
ceased
strife
and
hatred
passed
away
and
these
belligerent
peoples
associated
in
love
and
friendship
for
strife
and
warfare
are
the
very
destroyers
of
human
foundations
whereas
peace
and
amity
are
the
builders
and
safeguards
of
human
welfare
as
an
instance
two
nations
which
have
remained
at
peace
for
centuries
declare
war
against
each
other
what
destruction
and
loss
befalls
both
in
one
year
of
strife
and
conflictthe
undoing
of
centuries
how
urgent
their
necessity
and
demand
for
peace
with
its
comfort
and
progress
instead
of
war
which
blasts
and
destroys
the
foundation
of
all
human
attainment
the
body
politic
may
be
likened
to
the
human
organism
as
long
as
the
various
members
and
parts
of
that
organism
are
coordinated
and
cooperating
in
harmony
we
have
as
a
result
the
expression
of
life
in
its
fullest
degree
when
these
members
lack
coordination
and
harmony
we
have
the
reverse
which
in
the
human
organism
is
disease
dissolution
death
similarly
in
the
body
politic
of
humanity
dissension
discord
and
warfare
are
always
destructive
and
inevitably
fatal
all
created
beings
are
dependent
upon
peace
and
coordination
for
every
contingent
and
phenomenal
being
is
a
composition
of
distinct
elements
as
long
as
there
is
affinity
and
cohesion
among
these
constituent
elements
strength
and
life
are
manifest
but
when
dissension
and
repulsion
arise
among
them
disintegration
follows
this
is
proof
that
peace
and
amity
which
god
has
willed
for
his
children
are
the
saving
factors
of
human
society
whereas
war
and
strife
which
violate
his
ordinances
are
the
cause
of
death
and
destruction
therefore
god
has
sent
his
prophets
to
announce
the
message
of
goodwill
peace
and
life
to
the
world
of
mankind
inasmuch
as
the
essential
reality
of
the
religions
is
one
and
their
seeming
variance
and
plurality
is
adherence
to
forms
and
imitations
which
have
arisen
it
is
evident
that
these
causes
of
difference
and
divergence
must
be
abandoned
in
order
that
the
underlying
reality
may
unite
mankind
in
its
enlightenment
and
upbuilding
all
who
hold
fast
to
the
one
reality
will
be
in
agreement
and
unity
then
shall
the
religions
summon
people
to
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
to
universal
justice
then
will
they
proclaim
equality
of
rights
and
exhort
men
to
virtue
and
to
faith
in
the
loving
mercy
of
god
the
underlying
foundation
of
the
religions
is
one
there
is
no
intrinsic
difference
between
them
therefore
if
the
essential
and
fundamental
ordinances
of
the
religions
be
observed
peace
and
unity
will
dawn
and
all
the
differences
of
sects
and
denominations
will
disappear
and
now
let
us
consider
the
various
peoples
of
the
world
all
the
nationsamerican
british
french
german
turkish
persian
arabare
children
of
the
same
adam
members
of
the
same
human
household
why
should
dissension
exist
among
them
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
one
native
land
and
that
native
land
was
provided
for
all
god
has
not
set
these
boundaries
and
race
limitations
why
should
imaginary
barriers
which
god
has
not
originally
destined
be
made
a
cause
of
contention
god
has
created
and
provided
for
all
he
is
the
preserver
of
all
and
all
are
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
his
mercy
not
a
single
soul
is
deprived
inasmuch
as
we
have
such
a
loving
god
and
creator
why
should
we
be
at
war
with
each
other
now
that
his
light
is
shining
universally
why
should
we
cast
ourselves
into
darkness
as
his
table
is
spread
for
all
his
children
why
should
we
deprive
each
other
of
its
sustenance
as
his
effulgence
is
shining
upon
all
why
should
we
seek
to
live
among
the
shadows
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
only
cause
is
ignorance
and
that
the
result
is
perdition
discord
deprives
humanity
of
the
eternal
favors
of
god
therefore
we
must
forget
all
imaginary
causes
of
difference
and
seek
the
very
fundamentals
of
the
divine
religions
in
order
that
we
may
associate
in
perfect
love
and
accord
and
consider
humankind
as
one
family
the
surface
of
the
earth
as
one
nationality
and
all
races
as
one
humanity
let
us
live
under
the
protection
of
god
attaining
eternal
happiness
in
this
world
and
everlasting
life
in
the
world

this
is
a
very
joyous
evening
an
evidence
in
itself
of
the
possibility
of
uniting
the

the
westan
eastern
man
appearing
before
an
assemblage
of
reverent
western
people
the
east
and
west
the
orient
and

shall
be
united
if
we
search
history
we
shall
not
find
the
record
of
such
an
occasion
where
one
has
traveled
from
the
far
east
to
the
far
west
to
address
a
meeting
of
this
universal
character
this
is
a
miracle
of
the
twentieth
century
which
proves
that
the
seemingly
impossible
may
become
real
and
possible
in
the
kingdom
of
man
praise
be
to
god
the
dark
ages
have
disappeared
and
the
age
of
light
has
at
last
arrived
the
sun
of
reality
has
dawned
with
supreme
effulgence
the
realities
of
things
have
become
manifest
and
renewed
the
mysteries
of
the
unknown
have
been
revealed
and
great
inventions
and
discoveries
mark
this
period
as
a
most
wonderful
age
through
the
ingenuity
and
inventions
of
man
it
is
possible
to
cross
the
wide
oceans
fly
through
the
air
and
travel
in
submarine
depths
at
any
moment
the
orient
and
occident
can
communicate
with
each
other
trains
speed
across
the
continents
the
human
voice
has
been
arrested
and
reproduced
and
now
man
can
speak
at
long
distances
from
any
point
these
are
some
of
the
signs
of
this
glorious
century
the
great
progress
mentioned
has
taken
place
in
the
material
world
remarkable
signs
and
evidences
have
become
manifest
hidden
realities
and
mysteries
have
been
disclosed
this
is
the
time
for
man
to
strive
and
put
forth
his
greatest
efforts
in
spiritual
directions
material
civilization
has
reached
an
advanced
plane
but
now
there
is
need
of
spiritual
civilization
material
civilization
alone
will
not
satisfy
it
cannot
meet
the
conditions
and
requirements
of
the
present
age
its
benefits
are
limited
to
the
world
of
matter
there
is
no
limitation
to
the
spirit
of
man
for
spirit
in
itself
is
progressive
and
if
the
divine
civilization
be
established
the
spirit
of
man
will
advance
every
developed
susceptibility
will
increase
the
effectiveness
of
man
discoveries
of
the
real
will
become
more
and
more
possible
and
the
influence
of
divine
guidance
will
be
increasingly
recognized
all
this
is
conducive
to
the
divine
form
of
civilization
this
is
what
is
meant
in
the
bible
by
the
descent
of
the
new
jerusalem
the
heavenly
jerusalem
is
none
other
than
divine
civilization
and
it
is
now
ready
it
is
to
be
and
shall
be
organized
and
the
oneness
of
humankind
will
be
a
visible
fact
humanity
will
then
be
brought
together
as
one
the
various
religions
will
be
united
and
different
races
will
be
known
as
one
kind
the
orient
and
occident
will
be
conjoined
and
the
banner
of
international
peace
will
be
unfurled
the
world
shall
at
last
find
peace
and
the
equalities
and
rights
of
men
shall
be
established
the
capacity
of
humankind
will
be
tested
and
a
degree
shall
be
attained
where
equality
is
a
reality
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
will
enjoy
like
interests
and
the
poor
shall
possess
a
portion
of
the
comforts
of
life
just
as
the
rich
are
surrounded
by
their
luxuries
in
palaces
the
poor
will
have
at
least
their
comfortable
and
pleasant
places
of
abode
and
just
as
the
wealthy
enjoy
a
variety
of
food
the
needy
shall
have
their
necessities
and
no
longer
live
in
poverty
in
short
a
readjustment
of
the
economic
order
will
come
about
the
divine
sonship
will
attract
the
sun
of
reality
will
shine
forth
and
all
phenomenal
being
will
attain
a
portion
consider
what
is
this
material
civilization
of
the
day
giving
forth
has
it
not
produced
the
instruments
of
warfare
and
destruction
in
olden
times
the
weapon
of
war
was
the
sword
today
it
is
the
smokeless
gun
warships
a
century
ago
were
sailing
vessels
now
we
have
dreadnoughts
instruments
and
means
of
human
destruction
have
enormously
multiplied
in
this
era
of
material
civilization
but
if
material
civilization
shall
become
organized
in
conjunction
with
divine
civilization
if
the
man
of
moral
integrity
and
intellectual
acumen
shall
unite
for
human
betterment
and
uplift
with
the
man
of
spiritual
capacity
the
happiness
and
progress
of
the
human
race
will
be
assured
all
the
nations
of
the
world
will
then
be
closely
related
and
companionable
and
the
religions
will
merge
into
one
for
the
divine
reality
within
them
all
is
one
reality
abraham
proclaimed
this
reality
jesus
promulgated
it
all
the
prophets
who
have
appeared
in
the
world
have
founded
their
teachings
upon
it
therefore
the
people
of
the
world
have
this
one
true
unchangeable
basis
for
peace
and
agreement
and
war
which
has
raged
for
thousands
of
years
will
pass
away
for
centuries
and
cycles
humanity
has
been
engaged
in
war
and
conflict
at
one
time
the
pretext
for
war
has
been
religion
at
another
time
patriotism
racial
prejudice
national
politics
territorial
conquest
or
commercial
expansion
in
brief
humanity
has
never
been
at
peace
during
the
period
of
known
history
what
blood
has
been
shed
how
many
fathers
have
mourned
the
loss
of
sons
how
many
sons
have
wept
for
fathers
and
mothers
for
dear
ones
human
beings
have
been
the
food
and
targets
of
the
battlefield
and
everywhere
warfare
and
strife
have
been
the
theme
and
burden
of
history
ferocity
has
characterized
men
even
more
than
animals
the
lion
tiger
bear
and
wolf
are
ferocious
because
of
their
needs
unless
they
are
fierce
cruel
and
unrelenting
they
will
die
of
starvation
the
lion
cannot
graze
its
teeth
are
fitted
only
for
food
of
flesh
this
is
also
true
of
other
wild
animals
ferocity
is
natural
to
them
as
their
means
of
subsistence
but
human
ferocity
proceeds
from
selfishness
greed
and
oppression
it
springs
from
no
natural
necessity
man
needlessly
kills
a
thousand
fellow
creatures
becomes
a
hero
and
is
glorified
through
centuries
of
posterity
a
great
city
is
destroyed
in
one
day
by
a
commanding
general
how
ignorant
how
inconsistent
is
humankind
if
a
man
slays
another
man
we
brand
him
as
a
murderer
and
criminal
and
sentence
him
to
capital
punishment
but
if
he
kills
one
hundred
thousand
men
he
is
a
military
genius
a
great
celebrity
a
napoleon
idolized
by
his
nation
if
a
man
steals
one
dollar
he
is
called
a
thief
and
put
into
prison
if
he
rapes
and
pillages
an
innocent
country
by
military
invasion
he
is
crowned
a
hero
how
ignorant
is
humankind
ferocity
does
not
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
man
it
is
the
province
of
man
to
confer
life
not
death
it
behooves
him
to
be
the
cause
of
human
welfare
but
inasmuch
as
he
glories
in
the
savagery
of
animalism
it
is
an
evidence
that
divine
civilization
has
not
been
established
in
human
society
material
civilization
has
advanced
unmistakably
but
because
it
is
not
associated
with
divine
civilization
evil
and
wickedness
abound
in
ancient
times
if
two
nations
were
at
war
twelve
months
not
over
twenty
thousand
men
would
be
killed
now
the
instruments
of
death
have
become
so
multiplied
and
perfected
that
one
hundred
thousand
can
be
destroyed
in
a
day
in
three
months
during
the
russojapanese
war
one
million
perished
this
was
undreamed
of
in
former
cycles
the
cause
is
the
absence
of
divine
civilization
this
revered
american
nation
presents
evidences
of
greatness
and
worth
it
is
my
hope
that
this
just
government
will
stand
for
peace
so
that
warfare
may
be
abolished
throughout
the
world
and
the
standards
of
national
unity
and
reconciliation
be
upraised
this
is
the
greatest
attainment
of
the
world
of
humanity
this
american
nation
is
equipped
and
empowered
to
accomplish
that
which
will
adorn
the
pages
of
history
to
become
the
envy
of
the
world
and
be
blest
in
the
east
and
the
west
for
the
triumph
of
its
democracy
i
pray
that
this
may
come
to
pass
and
i
ask
the
blessing
of
god

its

the

the

of

the

depend
upon

the

then
the
radiance
of
the

be

and

civilization

body
a

they

they

they

it

my
hope
that

as
they

beatty
i
have
come
from
the
orient
to
visit
your
country
surely
this
continent
is
praiseworthy
from
all
points
of
view
and
there
are
signs
of
prosperity
everywhere
the
people
show
refinement
and
evidences
of
progressive
civilization
abound
i
will
give
you
a
brief
exposition
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
bahaullahs
teachings
in
order
that
you
may
be
informed
of
the
nature
and
significance
of
the
bahai
movement
about
sixty
years
ago
the
greatest
enmity
and
strife
existed
among
the
various
peoples
and
religious
denominations
of
persia
throughout
the
world
generally
war
and
dissension
prevailed
at
this
time
bahaullah
appeared
in
persia
and
began
devoting
himself
to
the
uplift
and
education
of
the
people
he
united
divergent
sects
and
creeds
removed
religious
racial
patriotic
and
political
prejudices
and
established
a
strong
bond
of
unity
and
reconciliation
among
varying
degrees
and
classes
of
mankind
the
enmity
then
existing
among
the
people
was
so
bitter
and
intense
that
even
ordinary
association
was
out
of
the
question
they
would
not
meet
and
consult
with
each
other
at
all
through
the
power
of
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
the
most
wonderful
results
were
witnessed
he
removed
the
prejudices
and
hatred
from
human
hearts
and
wrought
such
transformation
in
their
attitudes
toward
each
other
that
today
in
persia
there
is
perfect
accord
among
hitherto
bigoted
religionists
varying
sects
and
divergent
classes
this
was
not
an
easy
accomplishment
for
bahaullah
underwent
severe
trials
great
difficulties
and
violent
persecution
he
was
imprisoned
tortures
were
inflicted
upon
him
and
finally
he
was
banished
from
his
native
land
he
bore
every
ordeal
and
infliction
cheerfully
in
his
successive
exiles
from
country
to
country
up
to
the
time
of
his
ascension
from
this
world
he
was
enabled
to
promulgate
his
teachings
even
from
prison
wherever
his
oppressors
sent
him
he
hoisted
the
standard
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
promulgated
the
principles
of
the
unity
of
mankind
some
of
these
principles
are
as
follows
first
it
is
incumbent
upon
all
mankind
to
investigate
truth
if
such
investigation
be
made
all
should
agree
and
be
united
for
truth
or
reality
is
not
multiple
it
is
not
divisible
the
different
religions
have
one
truth
underlying
them
therefore
their
reality
is
one
each
of
the
divine
religions
embodies
two
kinds
of
ordinances
the
first
is
those
which
concern
spiritual
susceptibilities
the
development
of
moral
principles
and
the
quickening
of
the
conscience
of
man
these
are
essential
or
fundamental
one
and
the
same
in
all
religions
changeless
and
eternalreality
not
subject
to
transformation
abraham
heralded
this
reality
moses
promulgated
it
and
jesus
christ
established
it
in
the
world
of
mankind
all
the
divine
prophets
and
messengers
were
the
instruments
and
channels
of
this
same
eternal
essential
truth
the
second
kind
of
ordinances
in
the
divine
religions
is
those
which
relate
to
the
material
affairs
of
humankind
these
are
the
material
or
accidental
laws
which
are
subject
to
change
in
each
day
of
manifestation
according
to
exigencies
of
the
time
conditions
and
differing
capacities
of
humanity
for
instance
in
the
day
of
moses
ten
commandments
in
regard
to
murder
were
revealed
by
him
these
commandments
were
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
that
day
and
time
other
laws
embodying
drastic
punishments
were
enacted
by
mosesan
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
the
penalty
for
theft
was
amputation
of
the
hand
these
laws
and
penalties
were
applicable
to
the
degree
of
the
israelitish
people
of
that
period
who
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
and
desert
under
conditions
where
severity
was
necessary
and
justifiable
but
in
the
time
of
jesus
christ
this
kind
of
law
was
not
expedient
therefore
christ
abrogated
and
superseded
the
commands
of
moses
in
brief
every
one
of
the
divine
religions
contains
essential
ordinances
which
are
not
subject
to
change
and
material
ordinances
which
are
abrogated
according
to
the
exigencies
of
time
but
the
people
of
the
world
have
forsaken
the
divine
teachings
and
followed
forms
and
imitations
of
the
truth
inasmuch
as
these
human
interpretations
and
superstitions
differ
dissensions
and
bigotry
have
arisen
and
strife
and
warfare
have
prevailed
by
investigating
the
truth
or
foundation
of
reality
underlying
their
own
and
other
beliefs
all
would
be
united
and
agreed
for
this
reality
is
one
it
is
not
multiple
and
not
divisible
the
second
principle
or
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
proclamation
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanitythat
all
are
servants
of
god
and
belong
to
one
family
that
god
has
created
all
and
therefore
his
bestowals
are
universal
and
that
his
providence
training
sustenance
and
lovingkindness
surround
all
mankind
this
is
the
divine
policy
and
it
is
impossible
for
man
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
better
plan
and
policy
than
that
which
god
has
instituted
therefore
we
must
recognize
and
assist
the
purpose
of
the
glorious
lord
inasmuch
as
god
is
kind
and
loving
to
all
why
should
we
be
unkind
as
this
human
world
is
one
household
why
should
its
members
be
occupied
with
animosity
and
contention
therefore
humanity
must
be
looked
upon
with
the
eye
of
equal
estimate
and
in
the
same
attitude
of
love
the
noblest
of
men
is
he
who
serves
humankind
and
he
is
nearest
the
threshold
of
god
who
is
the
least
of
his
servants
the
glory
and
majesty
of
man
are
dependent
upon
his
servitude
to
his
fellow
creatures
and
not
upon
the
exercise
of
hostility
and
hatred
the
third
principle
or
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
oneness
of
religion
and
science
any
religious
belief
which
is
not
conformable
with
scientific
proof
and
investigation
is
superstition
for
true
science
is
reason
and
reality
and
religion
is
essentially
reality
and
pure
reason
therefore
the
two
must
correspond
religious
teaching
which
is
at
variance
with
science
and
reason
is
human
invention
and
imagination
unworthy
of
acceptance
for
the
antithesis
and
opposite
of
knowledge
is
superstition
born
of
the
ignorance
of
man
if
we
say
religion
is
opposed
to
science
we
lack
knowledge
of
either
true
science
or
true
religion
for
both
are
founded
upon
the
premises
and
conclusions
of
reason
and
both
must
bear
its
test
the
fourth
principle
or
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
readjustment
and
equalization
of
the
economic
standards
of
mankind
this
deals
with
the
question
of
human
livelihood
it
is
evident
that
under
present
systems
and
conditions
of
government
the
poor
are
subject
to
the
greatest
need
and
distress
while
others
more
fortunate
live
in
luxury
and
plenty
far
beyond
their
actual
necessities
this
inequality
of
portion
and
privilege
is
one
of
the
deep
and
vital
problems
of
human
society
that
there
is
need
of
an
equalization
and
apportionment
by
which
all
may
possess
the
comforts
and
privileges
of
life
is
evident
the
remedy
must
be
legislative
readjustment
of
conditions
the
rich
too
must
be
merciful
to
the
poor
contributing
from
willing
hearts
to
their
needs
without
being
forced
or
compelled
to
do
so
the
composure
of
the
world
will
be
assured
by
the
establishment
of
this
principle
in
the
religious
life
of
mankind
the
fifth
principle
or
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
abandoning
of
religious
racial
patriotic
and
political
prejudices
which
destroy
the
foundations
of
human
society
all
mankind
are
creatures
and
servants
of
the
one
god
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
one
home
humanity
is
one
family
and
household
distinctions
and
boundaries
are
artificial
human
why
should
there
be
discord
and
strife
among
men
all
must
become
united
and
coordinated
in
service
to
the
world
of
humanity
the
sixth
principle
or
teaching
of
bahaullah
concerns
the
equality
of
man
and
woman
he
has
declared
that
in
the
estimation
of
god
there
is
no
distinction
of
sex
the
one
whose
heart
is
most
pure
whose
deeds
and
service
in
the
cause
of
god
are
greater
and
nobler
is
most
acceptable
before
the
divine
thresholdwhether
male
or
female
in
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
sex
exists
in
perfect
equality
and
without
distinction
or
invidious
estimate
the
animal
although
inferior
to
man
in
intelligence
and
reason
recognizes
sex
equality
why
should
man
who
is
endowed
with
the
sense
of
justice
and
sensibilities
of
conscience
be
willing
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
human
family
should
be
rated
and
considered
as
subordinate
such
differentiation
is
neither
intelligent
nor
conscientious
therefore
the
principle
of
religion
has
been
revealed
by
bahaullah
that
woman
must
be
given
the
privilege
of
equal
education
with
man
and
full
right
to
his
prerogatives
that
is
to
say
there
must
be
no
difference
in
the
education
of
male
and
female
in
order
that
womankind
may
develop
equal
capacity
and
importance
with
man
in
the
social
and
economic
equation
then
the
world
will
attain
unity
and
harmony
in
past
ages
humanity
has
been
defective
and
inefficient
because
it
has
been
incomplete
war
and
its
ravages
have
blighted
the
world
the
education
of
woman
will
be
a
mighty
step
toward
its
abolition
and
ending
for
she
will
use
her
whole
influence
against
war
woman
rears
the
child
and
educates
the
youth
to
maturity
she
will
refuse
to
give
her
sons
for
sacrifice
upon
the
field
of
battle
in
truth
she
will
be
the
greatest
factor
in
establishing
universal
peace
and
international
arbitration
assuredly
woman
will
abolish
warfare
among
mankind
inasmuch
as
human
society
consists
of
two
parts
the
male
and
female
each
the
complement
of
the
other
the
happiness
and
stability
of
humanity
cannot
be
assured
unless
both
are
perfected
therefore
the
standard
and
status
of
man
and
woman
must
become
equalized
among
other
teachings
and
principles
bahaullah
counsels
the
education
of
all
members
of
society
no
individual
should
be
denied
or
deprived
of
intellectual
training
although
each
should
receive
according
to
capacity
none
must
be
left
in
the
grades
of
ignorance
for
ignorance
is
a
defect
in
the
human
world
all
mankind
must
be
given
a
knowledge
of
science
and
philosophythat
is
as
much
as
may
be
deemed
necessary
all
cannot
be
scientists
and
philosophers
but
each
should
be
educated
according
to
his
needs
and
deserts
bahaullah
teaches
that
the
world
of
humanity
is
in
need
of
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
for
in
spiritual
quickening
and
enlightenment
true
oneness
is
attained
with
god
and
man
the
most
great
peace
cannot
be
assured
through
racial
force
and
effort
it
cannot
be
established
by
patriotic
devotion
and
sacrifice
for
nations
differ
widely
and
local
patriotism
has
limitations
furthermore
it
is
evident
that
political
power
and
diplomatic
ability
are
not
conducive
to
universal
agreement
for
the
interests
of
governments
are
varied
and
selfish
nor
will
international
harmony
and
reconciliation
be
an
outcome
of
human
opinions
concentrated
upon
it
for
opinions
are
faulty
and
intrinsically
diverse
universal
peace
is
an
impossibility
through
human
and
material
agencies
it
must
be
through
spiritual
power
there
is
need
of
a
universal
impelling
force
which
will
establish
the
oneness
of
humanity
and
destroy
the
foundations
of
war
and
strife
none
other
than
the
divine
power
can
do
this
therefore
it
will
be
accomplished
through
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
no
matter
how
far
the
material
world
advances
it
cannot
establish
the
happiness
of
mankind
only
when
material
and
spiritual
civilization
are
linked
and
coordinated
will
happiness
be
assured
then
material
civilization
will
not
contribute
its
energies
to
the
forces
of
evil
in
destroying
the
oneness
of
humanity
for
in
material
civilization
good
and
evil
advance
together
and
maintain
the
same
pace
for
example
consider
the
material
progress
of
man
in
the
last
decade
schools
and
colleges
hospitals
philanthropic
institutions
scientific
academies
and
temples
of
philosophy
have
been
founded
but
hand
in
hand
with
these
evidences
of
development
the
invention
and
production
of
means
and
weapons
for
human
destruction
have
correspondingly
increased
in
early
days
the
weapon
of
war
was
the
sword
now
it
is
the
magazine
rifle
among
the
ancients
men
fought
with
javelins
and
daggers
now
they
employ
shells
and
bombs
dreadnoughts
are
built
torpedoes
invented
and
every
few
days
new
ammunition
is
forthcoming
all
this
is
the
outcome
of
material
civilization
therefore
although
material
advancement
furthers
good
purposes
in
life
at
the
same
time
it
serves
evil
ends
the
divine
civilization
is
good
because
it
cultivates
morals
consider
what
the
prophets
of
god
have
contributed
to
human
morality
jesus
christ
summoned
all
to
the
most
great
peace
through
the
acquisition
of
pure
morals
if
the
moral
precepts
and
foundations
of
divine
civilization
become
united
with
the
material
advancement
of
man
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
happiness
of
the
human
world
will
be
attained
and
that
from
every
direction
the
glad
tidings
of
peace
upon
earth
will
be
announced
then
humankind
will
achieve
extraordinary
progress
the
sphere
of
human
intelligence
will
be
immeasurably
enlarged
wonderful
inventions
will
appear
and
the
spirit
of
god
will
reveal
itself
all
men
will
consort
in
joy
and
fragrance
and
eternal
life
will
be
conferred
upon
the
children
of
the
kingdom
then
will
the
power
of
the
divine
make
itself
effective
and
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
penetrate
the
essence
of
all
things
therefore
the
material
and
the
divine
or
merciful
civilizations
must
progress
together
until
the
highest
aspirations
and
desires
of
humanity
shall
become
realized

it
is
only
three
weeks
that
we
have
been
away
from
the
new
york
friends
yet
so
great
has
been
the
longing
to
see
you
that
it
seems
like
three
months
we
have
had
no
rest
by
day
or
night
since
we
left

traveling
moving
about
or

it
was
all
so
pleasantly
done
and
we
have
been
most
happy

the
friends
in
america
are
very
good
all
the
people
we
have
met
here
are
kind
and
pleasant
they
are
polite
and
not
antagonistic
although
somewhat
inquisitive
a
small
minority
of
them
seem
prejudiced
yet
even
these
have
their
good
points
the
american
people
have
a
real
love
for
advancement
they
are
not
content
to
stand
still
they
are
most
energetic
and
progressive
when
you
see
a
tree
growing
and
developing
be
hopeful
of
its
outcome
it
will
blossom
and
bear
fruit
eventually
if
you
see
dry
wood
or
old
trees
there
is
no
hope
whatever
of
fruitage
the
questions
asked
us
have
been
opportune
and
to
the
point
our
answers
have
not
been
utilized
for
controversy
and
argument
we
met
savants
and
learned
men
and
satisfied
them
with
our
explanations
important
people
expressed
their
satisfaction
and
pleasure
at
our
replies
to
their
inquiries
in
brief
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
in
the
aggregate
of
people
we
met
anyone
who
was
dissatisfied
some
scholastic
minds
aimed
only
at
fruitless
discussion
in
chicago
we
met
two
clergymendelivering
an
address
at
the
church
of
one
and
having
dinner
with
the
other
both
manifested
great
love
likewise
among
all
the
people
we
met
not
a
single
soul
arose
in
opposition
or
went
away
disappointed
yesterday
in
washington
we
met
a
group
of
important
people
one
prominent
in
political
circles
came
with
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
there
were
many
ladies
of
the
diplomatic
circle
present
after
we
had
spoken
the
politician
referred
to
raised
the
point
that
the
foundation
of
all
religions
from
time
immemorial
had
been
peace
love
and
accordprinciples
conducive
to
fellowship
and
unificationyet
jesus
he
declared
had
been
the
cause
of
discord
and
strife
and
not
a
factor
in
the
realization
of
unity
therefore
he
said
i
cannot
accept
your
statements
and
explanations
that
religion
has
been
the
source
of
human
betterment
after
we
explained
further
he
said
what
you
have
stated
may
cause
me
to
change
my
views
and
agree
with
you
during
this
time
the
justice
remained
silent
fearing
he
might
have
some
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
we
asked
if
anything
presented
had
been
objectionable
to
his
opinion
he
replied
not
at
all
not
at
all
its
all
right
its
all
right
this
is
the
characteristic
expression
of
the
occidentall
right
all
right
there
were
also
present
at
this
meeting
several
cabinet
officers
united
states
senators
many
from
the
foreign
diplomatic
service
army
and
navy
officials
and
other
dignitaries
the
servant
of
god
our
hostess
experienced
much
trouble
in
preparation
and
entertainment
but
was
always
active
and
energetic
in
service
inviting
important
and
influential
people
to
the
gatherings
we
spoke
to
all
from
their
own
standpoints
with
most
satisfactory
results
we
were
working
day
and
night
so
there
was
very
little
time
for
individual
and
private
interviews
in
washington
too
we
called
a
meeting
of
the
blacks
and
whites
the
attendance
was
very
large
the
blacks
predominating
at
our
second
gathering
this
was
reversed
but
at
the
third
meeting
we
were
unable
to
say
which
color
predominated
these
meetings
were
a
great
practical
lesson
upon
the
unity
of
colors
and
races
in
the
bahai
teaching
we
said
in
part
the
black
man
must
ever
be
grateful
to
the
white
man
for
he
has
manifested
great
courage
and
selfsacrifice
in
behalf
of
the
black
race
four
years
he
fought
their
cause
enduring
severe
hardships
sacrificing
life
family
treasure
all
for
his
black
brother
until
the
great
war
ended
in
the
proclamation
of
freedom
by
this
effort
and
accomplishment
the
black
race
throughout
the
world
was
influenced
and
benefited
had
this
not
been
accomplished
the
black
man
in
africa
would
still
be
bound
by
the
chains
of
slavery
therefore
his
race
should
everywhere
be
grateful
for
no
greater
evidence
of
humanism
and
courageous
devotion
could
be
shown
than
the
white
man
has
displayed
if
the
blacks
of
the
united
states
forget
this
sacrifice
zeal
and
manhood
on
the
part
of
the
whites
no
ingratitude
could
be
greater
or
more
censurable
if
they
could
see
the
wretched
conditions
and
surroundings
of
the
black
people
of
africa
today
the
contrast
would
be
apparent
and
the
fact
clearly
evident
that
the
black
race
in
america
enjoys
incomparable
advantages
the
comfort
and
civilization
under
which
they
live
here
are
due
to
the
white
mans
effort
and
sacrifice
had
this
sacrifice
not
been
made
they
would
still
be
in
the
bonds
and
chains
of
slavery
scarcely
lifted
out
of
an
aboriginal
condition
therefore
always
show
forth
your
gratitude
to
the
white
man
eventually
all
differences
will
disappear
and
you
will
completely
win
his
friendship
god
maketh
no
distinction
between
the
white
and
the
black
if
the
hearts
are
pure
both
are
acceptable
unto
him
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
on
account
of
either
color
or
race
all
colors
are
acceptable
to
him
be
they
white
black
or
yellow
inasmuch
as
all
were
created
in
the
image
of
god
we
must
bring
ourselves
to
realize
that
all
embody
divine
possibilities
if
you
go
into
a
garden
and
find
all
the
flowers
alike
in
form
species
and
color
the
effect
is
wearisome
to
the
eye
the
garden
is
more
beautiful
when
the
flowers
are
manycolored
and
different
the
variety
lends
charm
and
adornment
in
a
flock
of
doves
some
are
white
some
black
red
blue
yet
they
make
no
distinction
among
themselves
all
are
doves
no
matter
what
the
color
this
variety
in
forms
and
colorings
which
is
manifest
in
all
the
kingdoms
is
according
to
creative
wisdom
and
has
a
divine
purpose
nevertheless
whether
the
creatures
be
all
alike
or
all
different
should
not
be
the
cause
of
strife
and
quarreling
among
them
especially
why
should
man
find
cause
for
discord
in
the
color
or
race
of
his
fellow
creature
no
educated
or
illumined
mind
will
allow
that
this
differentiation
and
discord
should
exist
or
that
there
is
any
ground
for
it
therefore
the
whites
should
be
just
and
kind
to
the
blacks
who
in
turn
should
reflect
an
equal
measure
of
appreciation
and
gratitude
then
will
the
world
become
as
one
great
garden
of
flowering
humanity
variegated
and
multicolored
rivaling
each
other
only
in
the
virtues
and
graces
which
are

notes
by

foster
i
wish
to
speak
upon
the
subject
of
divine
unity
the
oneness
of
god
before
this
revered
assemblage
it
is
a
selfevident
fact
that
phenomenal
existence
can
never
grasp
nor
comprehend
the
ancient
and
essential
reality
utter
weakness
cannot
understand
absolute
strength
when
we
view
the
world
of
creation
we
discover
differences
in
degree
which
make
it
impossible
for
the
lower
to
comprehend
the
higher
for
example
the
mineral
kingdom
no
matter
how
much
it
may
advance
can
never
comprehend
the
phenomena
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
whatever
development
the
vegetable
may
attain
it
can
have
no
message
from
nor
come
in
touch
with
the
kingdom
of
the
animal
however
perfect
may
be
the
growth
of
a
tree
it
cannot
realize
the
sensation
of
sight
hearing
smell
taste
and
touch
these
are
beyond
its
limitation
although
it
is
the
possessor
of
existence
in
the
world
of
creation
a
tree
nevertheless
has
no
knowledge
of
the
superior
degree
of
the
animal
kingdom
likewise
no
matter
how
great
the
advancement
of
the
animal
it
can
have
no
idea
of
the
human
plane
no
knowledge
of
intellect
and
spirit
difference
in
degree
is
an
obstacle
to
this
comprehension
a
lower
degree
cannot
comprehend
a
higher
although
all
are
in
the
same
world
of
creationwhether
mineral
vegetable
or
animal
degree
is
the
barrier
and
limitation
in
the
human
plane
of
existence
we
can
say
we
have
knowledge
of
a
vegetable
its
qualities
and
product
but
the
vegetable
has
no
knowledge
or
comprehension
whatever
of
us
no
matter
how
near
perfection
this
rose
may
advance
in
its
own
sphere
it
can
never
possess
hearing
and
sight
inasmuch
as
in
the
creational
world
which
is
phenomenal
difference
of
degree
is
an
obstacle
or
hindrance
to
comprehension
how
can
the
human
being
which
is
a
created
exigency
comprehend
the
ancient
divine
reality
which
is
essential
this
is
impossible
because
the
reality
of
divinity
is
sanctified
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
created
being
man
furthermore
that
which
man
can
grasp
is
finite
to
man
and
man
to
it
is
as
infinite
is
it
possible
then
for
the
reality
of
divinity
to
be
finite
and
the
human
creature
infinite
on
the
contrary
the
reverse
is
true
the
human
is
finite
while
the
essence
of
divinity
is
infinite
whatever
comes
within
the
sphere
of
human
comprehension
must
be
limited
and
finite
as
the
essence
of
divinity
transcends
the
comprehension
of
man
therefore
god
brings
forth
certain
manifestations
of
the
divine
reality
upon
whom
he
bestows
heavenly
effulgences
in
order
that
they
may
be
intermediaries
between
humanity
and
himself
these
holy
manifestations
or
prophets
of
god
are
as
mirrors
which
have
acquired
illumination
from
the
sun
of
truth
but
the
sun
does
not
descend
from
its
high
zenith
and
does
not
effect
entrance
within
the
mirror
in
truth
this
mirror
has
attained
complete
polish
and
purity
until
the
utmost
capacity
of
reflection
has
been
developed
in
it
therefore
the
sun
of
reality
with
its
fullest
effulgence
and
splendor
is
revealed
therein
these
mirrors
are
earthly
whereas
the
reality
of
divinity
is
in
its
highest
apogee
although
its
lights
are
shining
and
its
heat
is
manifest
in
them
although
these
mirrors
are
telling
their
story
of
its
effulgence
the
sun
nevertheless
remains
in
its
own
lofty
station
it
does
not
descend
it
does
not
effect
entrance
because
it
is
holy
and
sanctified
the
sun
of
divinity
and
of
reality
has
revealed
itself
in
various
mirrors
though
these
mirrors
are
many
yet
the
sun
is
one
the
bestowals
of
god
are
one
the
reality
of
the
divine
religion
is
one
consider
how
one
and
the
same
light
has
reflected
itself
in
the
different
mirrors
or
manifestations
of
it
there
are
certain
souls
who
are
lovers
of
the
sun
they
perceive
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
from
every
mirror
they
are
not
fettered
or
attached
to
the
mirrors
they
are
attached
to
the
sun
itself
and
adore
it
no
matter
from
what
point
it
may
shine
but
those
who
adore
the
mirror
and
are
attached
to
it
become
deprived
of
witnessing
the
light
of
the
sun
when
it
shines
forth
from
another
mirror
for
instance
the
sun
of
reality
revealed
itself
from
the
mosaic
mirror
the
people
who
were
sincere
accepted
and
believed
in
it
when
the
same
sun
shone
from
the
messianic
mirror
the
jews
who
were
not
lovers
of
the
sun
and
who
were
fettered
by
their
adoration
of
the
mirror
of
moses
did
not
perceive
the
lights
and
effulgences
of
the
sun
of
reality
resplendent
in
jesus
therefore
they
were
deprived
of
its
bestowals
yet
the
sun
of
reality
the
word
of
god
shone
from
the
messianic
mirror
through
the
wonderful
channel
of
jesus
christ
more
fully
and
more
wonderfully
its
effulgences
were
manifestly
radiant
but
even
to
this
day
the
jews
are
holding
to
the
mosaic
mirror
therefore
they
are
bereft
of
witnessing
the
lights
of
eternity
in
jesus
in
brief
the
sun
is
one
sun
the
light
is
one
light
which
shines
upon
all
phenomenal
beings
every
creature
has
a
portion
thereof
but
the
pure
mirror
can
reveal
the
story
of
its
bounty
more
fully
and
completely
therefore
we
must
adore
the
light
of
the
sun
no
matter
through
what
mirror
it
may
be
revealed
we
must
not
entertain
prejudice
for
prejudice
is
an
obstacle
to
realization
inasmuch
as
the
effulgence
is
one
effulgence
the
human
realities
must
all
become
recipients
of
the
same
light
recognizing
in
it
the
compelling
force
that
unites
them
in
its
illumination
as
this
is
the
radiant
century
it
is
my
hope
that
the
sun
of
truth
may
illumine
all
humanity
may
the
eyes
be
opened
and
the
ears
become
attentive
may
souls
become
resuscitated
and
consort
together
in
the
utmost
harmony
as
recipients
of
the
same
light
perchance
god
will
remove
this
strife
and
warfare
of
thousands
of
years
may
this
bloodshed
pass
away
this
tyranny
and
oppression
cease
this
warfare
be
ended
may
the
light
of
love
shine
forth
and
illumine
hearts
and
may
human
lives
be
cemented
and
connected
until
all
of
us
may
find
agreement
and
tranquillity
beneath
the
same
tabernacle
and
with
the
standard
of
the
most
great
peace
above
us
move
steadily
onward
o
thou
kind
lord
o
thou
who
art
generous
and
merciful
we
are
the
servants
of
thy
threshold
and
are
gathered
beneath
the
sheltering
shadow
of
thy
divine
unity
the
sun
of
thy
mercy
is
shining
upon
all
and
the
clouds
of
thy
bounty
shower
upon
all
thy
gifts
encompass
all
thy
loving
providence
sustains
all
thy
protection
overshadows
all
and
the
glances
of
thy

notes
by
esther
foster
when
we
review
history
from
the
beginning
down
to
the
present
day
we
find
that
strife
and
warfare
have
prevailed
throughout
the
human
world
warsreligious
racial
or
politicalhave
arisen
from
human
ignorance
misunderstanding
and
lack
of
education
we
will
first
consider
religious
strife
and
conflict
it
is
evident
that
the
divine
prophets
have
appeared
in
the
world
to
establish
love
and
agreement
among
mankind
they
have
been
the
shepherds
and
not
the
wolves
the
shepherd
comes
forth
to
gather
and
lead
his
flock
and
not
to
disperse
them
by
creating
strife
every
divine
shepherd
has
assembled
a
flock
which
had
formerly
been
scattered
among
the
shepherds
was
moses
at
a
time
when
the
tribes
of
israel
were
wandering
and
dispersed
he
assembled
united
and
educated
them
to
higher
degrees
of
capacity
and
progress
until
they
passed
out
of
the
wilderness
of
discipline
into
the
holy
land
of
possession
he
transformed
their
degradation
into
glory
changed
their
poverty
into
wealth
and
replaced
their
vices
by
virtues
until
they
rose
to
such
a
zenith
that
the
splendor
of
the
sovereignty
of
solomon
was
made
possible
and
the
fame
of
their
civilization
extended
to
the
east
and
the
west
it
is
evident
therefore
that
moses
was
a
divine
shepherd
for
he
gathered
the
tribes
of
israel
together
and
united
them
in
the
power
and
strength
of
a
great
nationhood
when
the
messianic
star
of
jesus
christ
dawned
he
declared
he
had
come
to
gather
together
the
lost
tribes
or
scattered
sheep
of
moses
he
not
only
shepherded
the
flock
of
israel
but
brought
together
people
of
chaldea
egypt
syria
ancient
assyria
and
phoenicia
these
people
were
in
a
state
of
utmost
hostility
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
each
other
with
the
ferocity
of
animals
but
jesus
christ
brought
them
together
cemented
and
united
them
in
his
cause
and
established
such
a
bond
of
love
among
them
that
enmity
and
warfare
were
abandoned
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
divine
teachings
are
intended
to
create
a
bond
of
unity
in
the
human
world
and
establish
the
foundations
of
love
and
fellowship
among
mankind
divine
religion
is
not
a
cause
for
discord
and
disagreement
if
religion
becomes
the
source
of
antagonism
and
strife
the
absence
of
religion
is
to
be
preferred
religion
is
meant
to
be
the
quickening
life
of
the
body
politic
if
it
be
the
cause
of
death
to
humanity
its
nonexistence
would
be
a
blessing
and
benefit
to
man
therefore
in
this
day
the
divine
teachings
must
be
sought
for
they
are
the
remedies
for
the
present
conditions
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
purpose
of
a
remedy
is
to
heal
and
cure
if
it
be
productive
of
worse
symptoms
its
absence
or
discontinuance
is
preferable
at
a
time
when
the
arabian
tribes
and
nomadic
peoples
were
widely
separated
living
in
the
deserts
under
lawless
conditions
strife
and
bloodshed
continual
among
them
no
tribe
free
from
the
menace
of
attack
and
destruction
by
anotherat
such
a
critical
time
muhammad
appeared
he
gathered
these
wild
tribes
of
the
desert
together
reconciled
united
and
caused
them
to
agree
so
that
enmity
and
warfare
ceased
the
arabian
nation
immediately
advanced
until
its
dominion
extended
westward
to
spain
and
andalusia
from
these
facts
and
premises
we
may
conclude
that
the
establishing
of
the
divine
religions
is
for
peace
not
for
war
and
the
shedding
of
blood
inasmuch
as
all
are
founded
upon
one
reality
which
is
love
and
unity
the
wars
and
dissensions
which
have
characterized
the
history
of
religion
have
been
due
to
imitations
and
superstitions
which
arise
afterward
religion
is
reality
and
reality
is
one
the
fundamentals
of
the
religion
of
god
are
therefore
one
in
reality
there
is
neither
difference
nor
change
in
the
fundamentals
variance
is
caused
by
blind
imitations
prejudices
and
adherence
to
forms
which
appear
later
and
inasmuch
as
these
differ
discord
and
strife
result
if
the
religions
of
the
world
would
forsake
these
causes
of
difficulty
and
seek
the
fundamentals
all
would
agree
and
strife
and
dissension
would
pass
away
for
religion
and
reality
are
one
and
not
multiple
other
wars
are
caused
by
purely
imaginary
racial
differences
for
humanity
is
one
kind
one
race
and
progeny
inhabiting
the
same
globe
in
the
creative
plan
there
is
no
racial
distinction
and
separation
such
as
frenchman
englishman
american
german
italian
or
spaniard
all
belong
to
one
household
these
boundaries
and
distinctions
are
human
and
artificial
not
natural
and
original
all
mankind
are
the
fruits
of
one
tree
flowers
of
the
same
garden
waves
of
one
sea
in
the
animal
kingdom
no
such
distinction
and
separation
are
observed
the
sheep
of
the
east
and
the
sheep
of
the
west
would
associate
peacefully
the
oriental
flock
would
not
look
surprised
as
if
saying
these
are
sheep
of
the
occident
they
do
not
belong
to
our
country
all
would
gather
in
harmony
and
enjoy
the
same
pasture
without
evidence
of
local
or
racial
distinction
the
birds
of
different
countries
mingle
in
friendliness
we
find
these
virtues
in
the
animal
kingdom
shall
man
deprive
himself
of
these
virtues
man
is
endowed
with
superior
reasoning
power
and
the
faculty
of
perception
he
is
the
manifestation
of
divine
bestowals
shall
racial
ideas
prevail
and
obscure
the
creative
purpose
of
unity
in
his
kingdom
shall
he
say
i
am
a
german
i
am
a
frenchman
or
an
englishman
and
declare
war
because
of
this
imaginary
and
human
distinction
god
forbid
this
earth
is
one
household
and
the
native
land
of
all
humanity
therefore
the
human
race
should
ignore
distinctions
and
boundaries
which
are
artificial
and
conducive
to
disagreement
and
hostility
we
have
come
from
the
east
praise
be
to
god
we
find
this
continent
prosperous
the
climate
salubrious
and
delightful
the
inhabitants
genial
and
courteous
the
government
equitable
and
just
shall
we
entertain
any
other
thought
and
feeling
than
that
of
love
for
you
shall
we
say
this
is
not
our
native
land
therefore
everything
is
objectionable
this
would
be
gross
ignorance
to
which
man
must
not
subject
himself
man
is
endowed
with
powers
to
investigate
reality
and
the
reality
is
that
humanity
is
one
in
kind
and
equal
in
the
creative
plan
therefore
false
distinctions
of
race
and
native
land
which
are
factors
and
causes
of
warfare
must
be
abandoned
consider
what
is
happening
in
tripoli
how
the
poor
are
being
killed
and
the
blood
of
the
helpless
is
being
shed
upon
both
sides
children
made
fatherless
fathers
lamenting
the
death
of
their
sons
mothers
bewailing
the
loss
of
dear
ones
and
what
is
the
benefit
after
all
nothing
conceivable
is
it
therefore
justifiable
the
domestic
animals
do
not
manifest
hatred
and
cruelty
toward
each
other
that
is
the
attribute
of
the
wild
and
ferocious
beasts
in
a
flock
of
one
thousand
sheep
you
will
witness
no
bloodshed
numberless
species
of
birds
are
peaceful
in
flocks
wolves
lions
tigers
are
ferocious
because
it
is
their
natural
and
necessary
means
for
obtaining
food
man
has
no
need
of
such
ferocity
his
food
is
provided
in
other
ways
therefore
it
is
evident
that
warfare
cruelty
and
bloodshed
in
the
kingdom
of
man
are
caused
by
human
greed
hatred
and
selfishness
the
kings
and
rulers
of
nations
enjoy
luxury
and
ease
in
their
palaces
and
send
the
common
people
to
the
battlefieldoffer
them
as
the
food
and
targets
of
cannon
each
day
they
invent
new
instruments
for
the
more
complete
destruction
of
the
foundations
of
the
human
race
they
are
callous
and
merciless
toward
their
fellow
creatures
what
shall
atone
for
the
sufferings
and
grief
of
mothers
who
have
so
tenderly
cared
for
their
sons
what
sleepless
nights
they
have
spent
and
what
days
of
devotion
and
love
they
have
given
to
bring
their
children
to
maturity
yet
the
savagery
of
these
warring
rulers
causes
great
numbers
of
their
victims
to
be
torn
and
mutilated
in
a
day
what
ignorance
and
degradation
yea
even
greater
than
the
ferocious
beasts
themselves
for
a
wolf
will
carry
away
and
devour
one
sheep
at
a
time
whereas
an
ambitious
tyrant
may
cause
the
death
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
in
a
battle
and
glory
in
his
military
prowess
saying
i
am
commander
in
chief
i
have
won
this
mighty
victory
consider
the
ignorance
and
inconsistency
of
the
human
race
if
a
man
kills
another
no
matter
what
the
cause
may
be
he
is
pronounced
a
murderer
imprisoned
or
executed
but
the
brutal
oppressor
who
has
slain
one
hundred
thousand
is
idolized
as
a
hero
conqueror
or
military
genius
a
man
steals
a
small
sum
of
money
he
is
called
a
thief
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
but
the
military
leader
who
invades
and
pillages
a
whole
kingdom
is
acclaimed
heroic
and
a
mighty
man
of
valor
how
base
and
ignorant
is
man
in
persia
previous
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
among
the
various
tribes
and
peoples
sects
and
denominations
there
existed
the
greatest
animosity
strife
and
hatred
at
that
time
too
all
the
other
nations
of
the
east
were
in
the
same
condition
religionists
were
hostile
and
bigoted
sects
were
at
enmity
races
hated
each
other
tribes
were
constantly
at
war
everywhere
antagonism
and
conflict
prevailed
men
shunned
and
were
suspicious
of
each
other
the
man
who
could
kill
a
number
of
his
fellow
creatures
was
glorified
for
his
heroism
and
strength
among
religionists
it
was
esteemed
a
praiseworthy
deed
to
take
the
life
of
one
who
held
an
opposite
belief
at
this
time
bahaullah
arose
and
declared
his
mission
he
founded
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
proclaimed
that
all
are
servants
of
the
loving
and
merciful
god
who
has
created
nourished
and
provided
for
all
therefore
why
should
men
be
unjust
and
unkind
to
each
other
showing
forth
that
which
is
contrary
to
god
as
he
loves
us
why
should
we
entertain
animosity
and
hate
if
god
did
not
love
all
he
would
not
have
created
trained
and
provided
for
all
lovingkindness
is
the
divine
policy
shall
we
consider
human
policy
and
attitude
superior
to
the
wisdom
and
policy
of
god
this
would
be
inconceivable
impossible
therefore
we
must
emulate
and
follow
the
divine
policy
dealing
with
each
other
in
the
utmost
love
and
tenderness
bahaullah
declared
the
most
great
peace
and
international
arbitration
he
voiced
these
principles
in
numerous
epistles
which
were
circulated
broadcast
throughout
the
east
he
wrote
to
all
the
kings
and
rulers
encouraging
advising
and
admonishing
them
in
regard
to
the
establishment
of
peace
making
it
evident
by
conclusive
proofs
that
the
happiness
and
glory
of
humanity
can
only
be
assured
through
disarmament
and
arbitration
this
was
nearly
fifty
years
ago
because
he
promulgated
the
message
of
universal
peace
and
international
agreement
the
kings
of
the
orient
arose
against
him
for
they
did
not
find
their
personal
and
national
benefits
advanced
by
his
admonition
and
teaching
they
persecuted
him
bitterly
inflicted
upon
him
every
torment
imprisoned
bastinadoed
banished
him
and
eventually
confined
him
in
a
fortress
then
they
arose
against
his
followers
for
the
establishment
of
international
peace
the
blood
of
twenty
thousand
bahais
was
spilled
their
homes
were
destroyed
their
children
made
captives
and
their
possessions
pillaged
yet
none
of
these
people
waxed
cold
or
wavered
in
devotion
even
to
this
day
the
bahais
are
persecuted
and
quite
recently
a
number
were
killed
for
wherever
they
are
found
they
put
forth
the
greatest
efforts
to
establish
the
peace
of
the
world
they
not
only
promulgate
principles
they
are
people
of
action
in
persia
today
through
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
you
will
find
people
of
various
beliefs
and
denominations
living
together
in
the
utmost
peace
and
agreement
the
former
enmities
and
hatred
have
passed
away
and
they
exercise
the
utmost
love
toward
all
mankind
for
they
realize
and
know
that
all
are
the
creatures
and
servants
of
one
god
this
is
directly
due
to
the
divine
teachings
at
most
it
is
simply
this
that
the
ignorant
must
be
educated
the
ailing
must
be
healed
those
who
are
as
children
in
the
scale
of
development
must
be
helped
to
reach
the
age
of
maturity
we
must
not
be
unfriendly
to
anyone
because
of
ignorance
neither
must
we
reject
the
immature
or
turn
away
from
the
sick
but
administer
the
remedy
for
each
human
need
until
all
are
united
in
the
providence
of
god
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
essential
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
are
unity
and
love
if
religion
be
productive
of
discord
among
mankind
it
is
a
destroyer
and
not
divine
for
religion
implies
unity
and
binding
together
and
not
separation
mere
knowledge
of
principles
is
not
sufficient
we
all
know
and
admit
that
justice
is
good
but
there
is
need
of
volition
and
action
to
carry
out
and
manifest
it
for
example
we
might
think
it
good
to
build
a
church
but
simply
thinking
of
it
as
a
good
thing
will
not
help
its
erection
the
ways
and
means
must
be
provided
we
must
will
to
build
it
and
then
proceed
with
the
construction
all
of
us
know
that
international
peace
is
good
that
it
is
conducive
to
human
welfare
and
the
glory
of
man
but
volition
and
action
are
necessary
before
it
can
be
established
action
is
essential
inasmuch
as
this
century
is
a
century
of
light
capacity
for
action
is
assured
to
mankind
necessarily
the
divine
principles
will
be
spread
among
men
until
the
time
of
action
arrives
surely
this
has
been
so
and
truly
the
time
and
conditions
are
ripe
for
action
now
all
men
know
that
verily
war
is
a
destroyer
of
human
foundations
and
in
every
country
of
the
world
this
is
admitted
and
apparent
i
find
the
united
states
of
america
an
exceedingly
progressive
nation
the
government
just
the
people
in
a
state
of
readiness
and
the
principle
of
equality
established
to
an
extraordinary
degree
therefore
it
is
my
hope
that
inasmuch
as
the
standard
of
international
peace
must
be
upraised
it
may
be
upraised
upon
this
continent
for
this
nation
is
more
deserving
and
has
greater
capacity
for
such
an
initial
step
than
any
other
if
other
nations
should
attempt
to
do
this
the
motive
would
be
misunderstood
for
instance
if
great
britain
should
declare
for
international
peace
it
would
be
said
that
it
has
been
done
to
ensure
the
safety
of
her
colonies
if
france
should
hoist
the
standard
other
nations
would
declare
some
hidden
diplomatic
policy
underlies
the
action
russia
would
be
suspected
of
national
designs
if
the
first
step
were
taken
by
that
people
and
so
on
with
all
the
european
and
eastern
governments
but
the
united
states
of
america
could
not
be
accused
of
any
such
selfish
interest
your
government
has
strictly
speaking
no
colonies
to
protect
you
are
not
endeavoring
to
extend
your
domain
nor
have
you
need
of
territorial
expansion
therefore
if
america
takes
the
first
step
toward
the
establishing
of
world
peace
it
is
certain
to
be
ascribed
to
unselfishness
and
altruism
the
world
will
say
there
is
no
other
motive
than
altruism
and
service
to
humanity
in
this
action
by
the
united
states
therefore
it
is
my
hope
that
you
may
stand
forth
as
the
first
herald
of
peace
and
hoist
this
banner
for
this
banner
will
be
hoisted
raise
it
aloft
for
you
are
the
most
qualified
and
deserving
of
nations
the
other

although
i
felt

this

yet
because
i
attach
great
importance
to
this
assembly
and
was
longing
to
see
your
faces
i
have
come
the
expression
of
kindly
feelings
and
the
spirit
of
hospitality
manifested
by
the
former
speakers
are
most
grateful
i
am
thankful
for
the
susceptibilities
of
your
hearts
for
it
is
an
evidence
that
your
greatest
desire
is
the
establishment
of
international
peace
you
are
lovers
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
seekers
after
the
good
pleasure
of
the
lord
investigators
of
the
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
today
there
is
no
greater
glory
for
man
than
that
of
service
in
the
cause
of
the
most
great
peace
peace
is
light
whereas
war
is
darkness
peace
is
life
war
is
death
peace
is
guidance
war
is
error
peace
is
the
foundation
of
god
war
is
a
satanic
institution
peace
is
the
illumination
of
the
world
of
humanity
war
is
the
destroyer
of
human
foundations
when
we
consider
outcomes
in
the
world
of
existence
we
find
that
peace
and
fellowship
are
factors
of
upbuilding
and
betterment
whereas
war
and
strife
are
the
causes
of
destruction
and
disintegration
all
created
things
are
expressions
of
the
affinity
and
cohesion
of
elementary
substances
and
nonexistence
is
the
absence
of
their
attraction
and
agreement
various
elements
unite
harmoniously
in
composition
but
when
these
elements
become
discordant
repelling
each
other
decomposition
and
nonexistence
result
everything
partakes
of
this
nature
and
is
subject
to
this
principle
for
the
creative
foundation
in
all
its
degrees
and
kingdoms
is
an
expression
or
outcome
of
love
consider
the
restlessness
and
agitation
of
the
human
world
today
because
of
war
peace
is
health
and
construction
war
is
disease
and
dissolution
when
the
banner
of
truth
is
raised
peace
becomes
the
cause
of
the
welfare
and
advancement
of
the
human
world
in
all
cycles
and
ages
war
has
been
a
factor
of
derangement
and
discomfort
whereas
peace
and
brotherhood
have
brought
security
and
consideration
of
human
interests
this
distinction
is
especially
pronounced
in
the
present
world
conditions
for
warfare
in
former
centuries
had
not
attained
the
degree
of
savagery
and
destructiveness
which
now
characterizes
it
if
two
nations
were
at
war
in
olden
times
ten
or
twenty
thousand
would
be
sacrificed
but
in
this
century
the
destruction
of
one
hundred
thousand
lives
in
a
day
is
quite
possible
so
perfected
has
the
science
of
killing
become
and
so
efficient
the
means
and
instruments
of
its
accomplishment
that
a
whole
nation
can
be
obliterated
in
a
short
time
therefore
comparison
with
the
methods
and
results
of
ancient
warfare
is
out
of
the
question
according
to
an
intrinsic
law
all
phenomena
of
being
attain
to
a
summit
and
degree
of
consummation
after
which
a
new
order
and
condition
is
established
as
the
instruments
and
science
of
war
have
reached
the
degree
of
thoroughness
and
proficiency
it
is
hoped
that
the
transformation
of
the
human
world
is
at
hand
and
that
in
the
coming
centuries
all
the
energies
and
inventions
of
man
will
be
utilized
in
promoting
the
interests
of
peace
and
brotherhood
therefore
may
this
esteemed
and
worthy
society
for
the
establishment
of
international
peace
be
confirmed
in
its
sincere
intentions
and
empowered
by
god
then
will
it
hasten
the
time
when
the
banner
of
universal
agreement
will
be
raised
and
international
welfare
will
be
proclaimed
and
consummated
so
that
the
darkness
which
now
encompasses
the
world
shall
pass
away
sixty
years
ago
bahaullah
was
in
persia
seventy
years
ago
the
bab
appeared
there
these
two
blessed
souls
devoted
their
lives
to
the
foundation
of
international
peace
and
love
among
mankind
they
strove
with
heart
and
soul
to
establish
the
teachings
by
which
divergent
people
might
be
brought
together
and
no
strife
rancor
or
hatred
prevail
bahaullah
addressing
all
humanity
said
that
adam
the
parent
of
mankind
may
be
likened
to
the
tree
of
nativity
upon
which
you
are
the
leaves
and
blossoms
inasmuch
as
your
origin
was
one
you
must
now
be
united
and
agreed
you
must
consort
with
each
other
in
joy
and
fragrance
he

he
said
that
man
must
recognize
the
oneness
of
humanity
for
all
in
origin
belong
to
the
same
household
and
all
are
servants
of
the
same
god
therefore
mankind
must
continue
in
the
state
of
fellowship
and
love
emulating
the
institutions
of
god
and
turning
away
from
satanic
promptings
for
the
divine
bestowals
bring
forth
unity
and
agreement
whereas
satanic
leadings
induce
hatred
and
war
this
remarkable
personage
was
able
by
these
principles
to
establish
a
bond
of
unity
among
the
differing
sects
and
divergent
people
of
persia
those
who
followed
his
teachings
no
matter
from
what
denomination
or
faction
they
came
were
conjoined
by
the
ties
of
love
until
now
they
cooperate
and
live
together
in
peace
and
agreement
they
are
real
brothers
and
sisters
no
distinctions
of
class
are
observed
among
them
and
complete
harmony
prevails
daily
this
bond
of
affinity
is
strengthening
and
their
spiritual
fellowship
continually
develops
in
order
to
ensure
the
progress
of
mankind
and
to
establish
these
principles
bahaullah
suffered
every
ordeal
and
difficulty
the
bab
became
a
martyr
and
over
twenty
thousand
men
and
women
sacrificed
their
lives
for
their
faith
bahaullah
was
imprisoned
and
subjected
to
severe
persecutions
finally
he
was
exiled
from
persia
to
mesopotamia
from
baghdad
he
was
sent
to
constantinople
and
adrianople
and
from
thence
to
the
prison
of
akka
in
syria
through
all
these
ordeals
he
strove
day
and
night
to
proclaim
the
oneness
of
humanity
and
promulgate
the
message
of
universal
peace
from
the
prison
of
akka
he
addressed
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
earth
in
lengthy
letters
summoning
them
to
international
agreement
and
explicitly
stating
that
the
standard
of
the
most
great
peace
would
surely
be
upraised
in
the
world
this
has
come
to
pass
the
powers
of
earth
cannot
withstand
the
privileges
and
bestowals
which
god
has
ordained
for
this
great
and
glorious
century
it
is
a
need
and
exigency
of
the
time
man
can
withstand
anything
except
that
which
is
divinely
intended
and
indicated
for
the
age
and
its
requirements
nowpraise
be
to
godin
all
countries
of
the
world
lovers
of
peace
are
to
be
found
and
these
principles
are
being
spread
among
mankind
especially
in
this
country
praise
be
to
god
this
thought
is
prevailing
and
souls
are
continually
arising
as
defenders
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
endeavoring
to
assist
and
establish
international
peace
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
wonderful
democracy
will
be
able
to
realize
it
and
the
banner
of
international
agreement
will
be
unfurled
here
to
spread
onward
and
outward
among
all
the
nations
of
the
world
i
give
thanks
to
god
that
i
find
you
imbued
with
such
susceptibilities
and
lofty
aspirations
and
i
hope
that
you
will
be
the
means
of
spreading
this
light
to
all
men
thus
may
the
sun
of
reality
shine
upon
the
east
and
west
the
enveloping
clouds
shall
pass
away
and
the
heat
of
the
divine
rays
will
dispel
the
mist
the
reality
of
man
shall
develop
and
come
forth
as
the
image
of
god
his
creator
the
thoughts
of
man
shall
take
such
upward
flight
that
former
accomplishments
shall
appear
as
the
play
of
children
for
the
ideas
and
beliefs
of
the
past
and
the
prejudices
regarding
race
and
religion
have
ever
lowered
and
been
destructive
to
human
evolution
i
am
most
hopeful
that
in
this
century
these
lofty
thoughts
shall
be
conducive
to
human
welfare
let
this
century
be
the
sun
of
previous
centuries
the
effulgences
of
which
shall
last
forever
so
that
in
times
to
come
they
shall
glorify
the
twentieth
century
saying
the
twentieth
century
was
the
century
of
lights
the
twentieth
century
was
the
century
of
life
the
twentieth
century
was
the
century
of
international

the
twentieth

was
the

of

has
left

religions
are
many
but
the
reality
of

is
one
the

are

but
the

is
one
the
fountains
are
many
but
the
fountainhead
is
one
the
branches
are

but
the
tree
is

the
foundation
of
the

religions
is

were

no

there
would

no

muhammad
was
the
messenger
of
reality
the
bab
was
the
door
of
reality
bahaullah
was
the
splendor
of
reality
reality
is
one
it
does
not
admit
multiplicity
or
division
reality
is
as
the
sun
which
shines
forth
from
different
dawning
points
it
is
as
the
light
which
has
illumined
many
lanterns
therefore
if
the
religions
investigate
reality
and
seek
the
essential
truth
of
their
own
foundations
they
will
agree
and
no
difference
will
be
found
but
inasmuch
as
religions
are
submerged
in
dogmatic
imitations
forsaking
the
original
foundations
and
as
imitations
differ
widely
therefore
the
religions
are
divergent
and
antagonistic
these
imitations
may
be
likened
to
clouds
which
obscure
the
sunrise
but
reality
is
the
sun
if
the
clouds
disperse
the
sun
of
reality
shines
upon
all
and
no
difference
of
vision
will
exist
the
religions
will
then
agree
for
fundamentally
they
are
the
same
the
subject
is
one
but
predicates
are
many
the
divine
religions
are
like
the
progression
of
the
seasons
of
the
year
when
the
earth
becomes
dead
and
desolate
and
because
of
frost
and
cold
no
trace
of
vanished
spring
remains
the
springtime
dawns
again
and
clothes
everything
with
a
new
garment
of
life
the
meadows
become
fresh
and
green
the
trees
are
adorned
with
verdure
and
fruits
appear
upon
them
then
the
winter
comes
again
and
all
the
traces
of
spring
disappear
this
is
the
continuous
cycle
of
the
seasonsspring
winter
then
the
return
of
spring
but
though
the
calendar
changes
and
the
years
move
forward
each
springtime
that
comes
is
the
return
of
the
springtime
that
has
gone
this
spring
is
the
renewal
of
the
former
spring
springtime
is
springtime
no
matter
when
or
how
often
it
comes
the
divine
prophets
are
as
the
coming
of
spring
each
renewing
and
quickening
the
teachings
of
the
prophet
who
came
before
him
just
as
all
seasons
of
spring
are
essentially
one
as
to
newness
of
life
vernal
showers
and
beauty
so
the
essence
of
the
mission
and
accomplishment
of
all
the
prophets
is
one
and
the
same
now
the
people
of
religion
have
lost
sight
of
the
essential
reality
of
the
spiritual
springtime
they
have
held
tenaciously
to
ancestral
forms
and
imitations
and
because
of
this
there
is
variance
strife
and
altercation
among
them
therefore
we
must
now
abandon
these
imitations
and
seek
the
foundation
of
the
divine
teachings
and
inasmuch
as
the
foundation
is
one
reality
the
divergent
religionists
must
agree
in
it
so
that
love
and
unity
will
be
established
among
all
people
and
denominations
at
a
time
when
the
orient
was
rent
by
religious
dissension
bahaullah
appeared
he
founded
teachings
which
became
the
means
of
uniting
the
various
and
divergent
peoples
he
promulgated
principles
which
removed
the
cause
of
their
dissension
until
today
in
persia
those
who
had
been
constantly
at
war
are
united
christians
muslims
zoroastrians
jewspeople
of
every
belief
and
denomination
who
have
followed
the
teachings
of
bahaullahhave
attained
complete
fellowship
and
spiritual
agreement
former
differences
and
dissensions
have
passed
away
entirely
some
of
the
principles
of
bahaullahs
teaching
are
as
follows
first
that
the
oneness
of
humanity
shall
be
recognized
and
established
all
men
are
the
servants
of
god
he
has
created
all
he
is
the
provider
and
preserver
he
is
loving
to
all
inasmuch
as
he
is
just
and
kind
why
should
we
be
unjust
toward
each
other
as
god
has
quickened
us
with
life
why
should
we
be
the
cause
of
death
as
he
has
comforted
us
why
should
we
be
the
cause
of
anxiety
and
suffering
can
humanity
conceive
a
plan
and
policy
better
and
superior
to
that
of
god
it
is
certain
that
no
matter
how
capable
man
may
be
in
origination
of
plan
and
organization
of
purpose
his
efforts
will
be
inadequate
when
compared
with
the
divine
plan
and
purpose
for
the
policy
of
god
is
perfect
therefore
we
must
follow
the
will
and
plan
of
god
as
he
is
kind
to
all
we
must
be
likewise
and
it
is
certain
that
this
will
be
most
acceptable
to
god
second
that
truth
or
reality
must
be
investigated
for
reality
is
one
and
by
investigating
it
all
will
find
love
and
unity
those
who
are
ignorant
must
be
educated
the
ailing
must
be
healed
the
undeveloped
must
be
brought
to
maturity
shall
we
reject
or
oppose
the
ignorant
sick
or
immature
because
of
their
incapacity
is
it
not
better
to
be
kind
and
gentle
and
to
provide
the
means
of
remedy
therefore
under
no
circumstances
whatsoever
should
we
assume
any
attitude
except
that
of
gentleness
and
humility
third
that
religion
is
in
harmony
with
science
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
prophets
are
scientific
but
the
forms
and
imitations
which
have
appeared
are
opposed
to
science
if
religion
does
not
agree
with
science
it
is
superstition
and
ignorance
for
god
has
endowed
man
with
reason
in
order
that
he
may
perceive
reality
the
foundations
of
religion
are
reasonable
god
has
created
us
with
intelligence
to
perceive
them
if
they
are
opposed
to
science
and
reason
how
could
they
be
believed
and
followed
fourth
that
religion
must
be
conducive
to
love
and
unity
among
mankind
for
if
it
be
the
cause
of
enmity
and
strife
the
absence
of
religion
is
preferable
when
moses
appeared
the
tribes
of
israel
were
in
a
state
of
disunion
as
captives
of
the
pharaohs
moses
gathered
them
together
and
the
divine
law
established
fellowship
among
them
they
became
as
one
people
united
consolidated
after
which
they
were
rescued
from
bondage
they
passed
into
the
promised
land
advanced
in
all
degrees
developed
sciences
and
arts
progressed
in
material
affairs
increased
in
divine
or
spiritual
civilization
until
their
nation
rose
to
its
zenith
in
the
sovereignty
of
solomon
it
is
evident
therefore
that
religion
is
the
cause
of
unity
fellowship
and
progress
among
mankind
the
function
of
a
shepherd
is
to
gather
the
sheep
together
and
not
to
scatter
them
then
christ
appeared
he
united
varying
and
divergent
creeds
and
warring
people
of
his
time
he
brought
together
greeks
and
romans
reconciled
egyptians
and
assyrians
chaldeans
and
phoenicians
christ
established
unity
and
agreement
among
people
of
these
hostile
and
warring
nations
therefore
it
is
again
evident
that
the
purpose
of
religion
is
peace
and
concord
likewise
muhammad
appeared
at
a
time
when
the
peoples
and
tribes
of
arabia
were
divergent
and
in
a
state
of
continual
warfare
they
killed
each
other
pillaged
and
took
captive
wives
and
children
muhammad
united
these
fierce
tribes
established
a
foundation
of
fellowship
among
them
so
that
they
gave
up
warring
against
each
other
absolutely
and
established
communities
the
result
was
that
the
arabian
tribes
freed
themselves
from
the
persian
yoke
and
roman
control
established
an
independent
sovereignty
which
rose
to
a
high
degree
of
civilization
advanced
in
sciences
and
arts
extended
the
saracen
dominion
as
far
west
as
spain
and
andalusia
and
became
famous
throughout
the
world
therefore
it
is
proved
once
more
that
the
religion
of
god
is
intended
to
be
the
cause
of
advancement
and
solidarity
and
not
of
enmity
and
dissolution
if
it
becomes
the
cause
of
hatred
and
strife
its
absence
is
preferable
its
purpose
is
unity
and
its
foundations
are
one
when
bahaullah
appeared
in
persia
violent
strife
and
hatred
separated
the
peoples
and
tribes
of
that
country
they
would
not
come
together
for
any
purpose
except
war
they
would
not
partake
of
the
same
food
or
drink
of
the
same
water
association
and
intercourse
were
impossible
bahaullah
founded
the
oneness
of
humanity
among
these
people
and
bound
their
hearts
together
with
such
ties
of
love
that
they
were
completely
united
he
reestablished
the
prophetic
foundations
reformed
and
renewed
the
principles
laid
down
by
the
messengers
of
god
who
had
preceded
him
and
now
it
is
hoped
that
through
his
life
and
teachings
the
east
and
west
shall
become
so
united
that
no
trace
of
enmity
strife
and
discord
shall
remain

because
this
is
called
the
church
of
brotherhood
i
wish
to
speak
upon
the
brotherhood
of
mankind
there
is
perfect
brotherhood
underlying
humanity
for
all
are
servants
of
one
god
and
belong
to
one
family
under
the
protection
of
divine
providence
the
bond
of
fraternity
exists
in
humanity
because
all
are
intelligent
beings
created
in
the
realm
of
evolutionary
growth
there
is
brotherhood
potential
in
humanity
because
all
inhabit
this
earthly
globe
under
the
one
canopy
of
heaven
there
is
brotherhood
natal
in
mankind
because
all
are
elements
of
one
human
society
subject
to
the
necessity
of
agreement
and
cooperation
there
is
brotherhood
intended
in
humanity
because
all
are
waves
of
one
sea
leaves
and
fruit
of
one
tree
this
is
physical
fellowship
which
ensures
material
happiness
in
the
human
world
the
stronger
it
becomes
the
more
will
mankind
advance
and
the
circle
of
materiality
be
enlarged
the
real
brotherhood
is
spiritual
for
physical
brotherhood
is
subject
to
separation
the
wars
of
the
outer
world
of
existence
separate
humankind
but
in
the
eternal
world
of
spiritual
brotherhood
separation
is
unknown
material
or
physical
association
is
based
upon
earthly
interests
but
divine
fellowship
owes
its
existence
to
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
spiritual
brotherhood
may
be
likened
to
the
light
while
the
souls
of
humankind
are
as
lanterns
the
incandescent
lamps
here
are
many
yet
the
light
is
one
at
a
time
in
the
orient
when
even
physical
brotherhood
was
not
in
existence
bahaullah
appeared
at
first
he
set
forth
the
principles
of
physical
brotherhood
and
afterward
founded
the
spiritual
brotherhood
he
breathed
such
a
spirit
into
the
countries
of
the
orient
that
various
peoples
and
warring
tribes
were
blended
in
unity
their
bestowals
and
susceptibilities
became
one
their
purposes
one
purpose
their
desires
one
desire
to
such
a
degree
that
they
sacrificed
themselves
for
each
other
forfeiting
name
possessions
and
comfort
their
fellowship
became
indissoluble
this
is
eternal
spiritual
fellowship
heavenly
and
divine
brotherhood
which
defies
dissolution
material
civilization
advances
through
the
physical
association
of
mankind
the
progress
you
observe
in
the
outer
world
is
founded
mainly
upon
the
fraternity
of
material
interests
were
it
not
for
this
physical
and
mental
association
civilization
would
not
have
progressed
nowpraise
be
to
godthe
indissoluble
spiritual
association
is
evident
therefore
it
is
certain
that
divine
civilization
has
been
founded
and
the
world
will
progress
and
advance
spiritually
in
this
radiant
century
divine
knowledge
merciful
attributes
and
spiritual
virtues
will
attain
the
highest
degree
of
advancement
the
traces
have
become
manifest
in
persia
souls
have
advanced
to
such
a
degree
as
to
forfeit
life
and
possessions
for
each
other
their
spiritual
perceptions
have
developed
their
intelligence
has
quickened
their
souls
are
awakened
the
utmost
love
has
been
manifested
therefore
it
is
my
hope
that
spiritual
fraternity
shall
unite
the
east
and
the
west
and
bring
about
the
complete
abolition
of
warfare
among
mankind
may
it
bind
together
individuals
and
members
of
the
human
family
and
be
the
cause
of
advancing
minds
illuminating
hearts
and
allowing
divine
bestowals
to
encompass
us
from
all
directions
may
spiritual
susceptibilities
set
hearts
aglow
with
the
message
of
glad
tidings
may
spiritual
brotherhood
cause
rebirth
and
regeneration
for
its
creative
quickening
emanates
from
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
is
founded
by
the
power
of
god
surely
that
which
is
founded
through
the
divine
power
of
the
holy
spirit
is
permanent
in
its
potency
and
lasting
in
its
effect
material
brotherhood
does
not
prevent
nor
remove
warfare
it
does
not
dispel
differences
among
mankind
but
spiritual
alliance
destroys
the
very
foundation
of
war
effaces
differences
entirely
promulgates
the
oneness
of
humanity
revivifies
mankind
causes
hearts
to
turn
to
the
kingdom
of
god
and
baptizes
souls
with
the
holy
spirit
through
this
divine
brotherhood
the
material
world
will
become
resplendent
with
the
lights
of
divinity
the
mirror
of
materiality
will
acquire
its
lights
from
heaven
and
justice
will
be
established
in
the
world
so
that
no
trace
of
darkness
hatred
and
enmity
shall
be
visible
humanity
shall
come
within
the
bounds
of
security
the
prophethood
of
all
the
messengers
of
god
shall
be
established
zion
shall
leap
and
dance
jerusalem
shall
rejoice
the
mosaic
flame
shall
ignite
the
messianic
light
shall
shine
the
world
will
become
another
world
and
humanity
shall
put
on
another
power
this
is
the
greatest
divine
bestowal
this
is
the
effulgence
of
the
kingdom
of
god
this
is
the
day
of
illumination
this
is
the
merciful
century
we
must
appreciate
these
things
and
strive
in
order
that
the
utmost
desire
of
the
prophets
may
now
be
realized
and
all
the
glad
tidings
be
fulfilled
trust
in
the
favor
of
god
look
not
at
your
own
capacities
for
the
divine
bestowal
can
transform
a
drop
into
an
ocean
it
can
make
a
tiny
seed
a
lofty
tree
verily
divine
bestowals
are
like
the
sea
and
we
are
the
fishes
of
that
sea
the
fishes
must
not
look
at
themselves
they
must
behold
the
ocean
which
is
vast
and
wonderful
provision
for
the
sustenance
of
all
is
in
this
ocean
therefore
the
divine
bounties
encompass
all
and
love
eternal
shines
upon
all
the
question
has
been
asked
will
the
spiritual
progress
of
the
world
equal
and
keep
pace
with
material
progress
in
the
future
in
a
living
organism
the
full
measure
of
its
development
is
not
known
or
realized
at
the
time
of
its
inception
or
birth
development
and
progression
imply
gradual
stages
or
degrees
for
example
spiritual
advancement
may
be
likened
to
the
light
of
the
early
dawn
although
this
dawn
light
is
dim
and
pale
a
wise
man
who
views
the
march
of
the
sunrise
at
its
very
beginning
can
foretell
the
ascendancy
of
the
sun
in
its
full
glory
and
effulgence
he
knows
for
a
certainty
that
it
is
the
beginning
of
its
manifestation
and
that
later
it
will
assume
great
power
and
potency
again
for
example
if
he
takes
a
seed
and
observes
that
it
is
sprouting
he
will
know
assuredly
that
it
will
ultimately
become
a
tree
now
is
the
beginning
of
the
manifestation
of
the
spiritual
power
and
inevitably
the
potency
of
its
life
forces
will
assume
greater
and
greater
proportions
therefore
this
twentieth
century
is
the
dawn
or
beginning
of
spiritual
illumination
and
it
is
evident
that
day
by
day
it
will
advance
it
will
reach
such
a
degree
that
spiritual
effulgences
will
overcome
the
physical
so
that
divine
susceptibilities
will
overpower
material
intelligence
and
the
heavenly
light
dispel
and
banish
earthly
darkness
divine
healing
shall
purify
all
ills
and
the
cloud
of
mercy
will
pour
down
its
rain
the
sun
of
reality
will
shine
and
all
the
earth
shall
put
on
its
beautiful
green
carpet
among
the
results
of
the
manifestation
of
spiritual
forces
will
be
that
the
human
world
will
adapt
itself
to
a
new
social
form
the
justice
of
god
will
become
manifest
throughout
human
affairs
and
human
equality
will
be
universally
established
the
poor
will
receive
a
great
bestowal
and
the
rich
attain
eternal
happiness
for
although
at
the
present
time
the
rich
enjoy
the
greatest
luxury
and
comfort
they
are
nevertheless
deprived
of
eternal
happiness
for
eternal
happiness
is
contingent
upon
giving
and
the
poor
are
everywhere
in
the
state
of
abject
need
through
the
manifestation
of
gods
great
equity
the
poor
of
the
world
will
be
rewarded
and
assisted
fully
and
there
will
be
a
readjustment
in
the
economic
conditions
of
mankind
so
that
in
the
future
there
will
not
be
the
abnormally
rich
nor
the
abject
poor
the
rich
will
enjoy
the
privilege
of
this
new
economic
condition
as
well
as
the
poor
for
owing
to
certain
provisions
and
restrictions
they
will
not
be
able
to
accumulate
so
much
as
to
be
burdened
by
its
management
while
the
poor
will
be
relieved
from
the
stress
of
want
and
misery
the
rich
will
enjoy
his
palace
and
the
poor
will
have
his
comfortable
cottage
the
essence
of
the
matter
is
that
divine
justice
will
become
manifest
in
human
conditions
and
affairs
and
all
mankind
will
find
comfort
and
enjoyment
in
life
it
is
not
meant
that
all
will
be
equal
for
inequality
in
degree
and
capacity
is
a
property
of
nature
necessarily
there
will
be
rich
people
and
also
those
who
will
be
in
want
of
their
livelihood
but
in
the
aggregate
community
there
will
be
equalization
and
readjustment
of
values
and
interests
in
the
future
there
will
be
no
very
rich
nor
extremely
poor
there
will
be
an
equilibrium
of
interests
and
a
condition
will
be
established
which
will
make
both
rich
and
poor
comfortable
and
content
this
will
be
an
eternal
and
blessed
outcome
of
the
glorious
twentieth
century
which
will
be
realized
universally
the
significance
of
it
is
that
the
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
revealed
in
the
promises
of
the
holy
books
will
be
fulfilled

today
questions
of
the
utmost
importance
are
facing
humanity
questions
peculiar
to
this
radiant
century
in
former
centuries
there
was
not
even
mention
of
them
inasmuch
as
this
is
the
century
of
illumination
the
century
of
humanity
the
century
of
divine
bestowals
these
questions
are
being
presented
for
the
expression
of
public
opinion
and
in
all
the
countries
of
the
world
discussion
is
taking
place
looking
to
their
solution
one
of
these
questions
concerns
the
rights
of
woman
and
her
equality
with
man
in
past
ages
it
was
held
that
woman
and
man
were
not
equalthat
is
to
say
woman
was
considered
inferior
to
man
even
from
the
standpoint
of
her
anatomy
and
creation
she
was
considered
especially
inferior
in
intelligence
and
the
idea
prevailed
universally
that
it
was
not
allowable
for
her
to
step
into
the
arena
of
important
affairs
in
some
countries
man
went
so
far
as
to
believe
and
teach
that
woman
belonged
to
a
sphere
lower
than
human
but
in
this
century
which
is
the
century
of
light
and
the
revelation
of
mysteries
god
is
proving
to
the
satisfaction
of
humanity
that
all
this
is
ignorance
and
error
nay
rather
it
is
well
established
that
mankind
and
womankind
as
parts
of
composite
humanity
are
coequal
and
that
no
difference
in
estimate
is
allowable
for
all
are
human
the
conditions
in
past
centuries
were
due
to
womans
lack
of
opportunity
she
was
denied
the
right
and
privilege
of
education
and
left
in
her
undeveloped
state
naturally
she
could
not
and
did
not
advance
in
reality
god
has
created
all
mankind
and
in
the
estimation
of
god
there
is
no
distinction
as
to
male
and
female
the
one
whose
heart
is
pure
is
acceptable
in
his
sight
be
that
one
man
or
woman
god
does
not
inquire
art
thou
woman
or
art
thou
man
he
judges
human
actions
if
these
are
acceptable
in
the
threshold
of
the
glorious
one
man
and
woman
will
be
equally
recognized
and
rewarded
furthermore
the
education
of
woman
is
more
necessary
and
important
than
that
of
man
for
woman
is
the
trainer
of
the
child
from
its
infancy
if
she
be
defective
and
imperfect
herself
the
child
will
necessarily
be
deficient
therefore
imperfection
of
woman
implies
a
condition
of
imperfection
in
all
mankind
for
it
is
the
mother
who
rears
nurtures
and
guides
the
growth
of
the
child
this
is
not
the
function
of
the
father
if
the
educator
be
incompetent
the
educated
will
be
correspondingly
lacking
this
is
evident
and
incontrovertible
could
the
student
be
brilliant
and
accomplished
if
the
teacher
is
illiterate
and
ignorant
the
mothers
are
the
first
educators
of
mankind
if
they
be
imperfect
alas
for
the
condition
and
future
of
the
race
again
it
is
well
established
in
history
that
where
woman
has
not
participated
in
human
affairs
the
outcomes
have
never
attained
a
state
of
completion
and
perfection
on
the
other
hand
every
influential
undertaking
of
the
human
world
wherein
woman
has
been
a
participant
has
attained
importance
this
is
historically
true
and
beyond
disproof
even
in
religion
jesus
christ
had
twelve
disciples
and
among
his
followers
a
woman
known
as
mary
magdalene
judas
iscariot
had
become
a
traitor
and
hypocrite
and
after
the
crucifixion
the
remaining
eleven
disciples
were
wavering
and
undecided
it
is
certain
from
the
evidence
of
the
gospels
that
the
one
who
comforted
them
and
reestablished
their
faith
was
mary
magdalene
the
world
of
humanity
consists
of
two
parts
male
and
female
each
is
the
complement
of
the
other
therefore
if
one
is
defective
the
other
will
necessarily
be
incomplete
and
perfection
cannot
be
attained
there
is
a
right
hand
and
a
left
hand
in
the
human
body
functionally
equal
in
service
and
administration
if
either
proves
defective
the
defect
will
naturally
extend
to
the
other
by
involving
the
completeness
of
the
whole
for
accomplishment
is
not
normal
unless
both
are
perfect
if
we
say
one
hand
is
deficient
we
prove
the
inability
and
incapacity
of
the
other
for
singlehanded
there
is
no
full
accomplishment
just
as
physical
accomplishment
is
complete
with
two
hands
so
man
and
woman
the
two
parts
of
the
social
body
must
be
perfect
it
is
not
natural
that
either
should
remain
undeveloped
and
until
both
are
perfected
the
happiness
of
the
human
world
will
not
be
realized
the
most
momentous
question
of
this
day
is
international
peace
and
arbitration
and
universal
peace
is
impossible
without
universal
suffrage
children
are
educated
by
the
women
the
mother
bears
the
troubles
and
anxieties
of
rearing
the
child
undergoes
the
ordeal
of
its
birth
and
training
therefore
it
is
most
difficult
for
mothers
to
send
to
the
battlefield
those
upon
whom
they
have
lavished
such
love
and
care
consider
a
son
reared
and
trained
twenty
years
by
a
devoted
mother
what
sleepless
nights
and
restless
anxious
days
she
has
spent
having
brought
him
through
dangers
and
difficulties
to
the
age
of
maturity
how
agonizing
then
to
sacrifice
him
upon
the
battlefield
therefore
the
mothers
will
not
sanction
war
nor
be
satisfied
with
it
so
it
will
come
to
pass
that
when
women
participate
fully
and
equally
in
the
affairs
of
the
world
when
they
enter
confidently
and
capably
the
great
arena
of
laws
and
politics
war
will
cease
for
woman
will
be
the
obstacle
and
hindrance
to
it
this
is
true
and
without
doubt
it
has
been
objected
by
some
that
woman
is
not
equally
capable
with
man
and
that
she
is
deficient
by
creation
this
is
pure
imagination
the
difference
in
capability
between
man
and
woman
is
due
entirely
to
opportunity
and
education
heretofore
woman
has
been
denied
the
right
and
privilege
of
equal
development
if
equal
opportunity
be
granted
her
there
is
no
doubt
she
would
be
the
peer
of
man
history
will
evidence
this
in
past
ages
noted
women
have
arisen
in
the
affairs
of
nations
and
surpassed
men
in
their
accomplishments
among
them
was
zenobia
queen
of
the
east
whose
capital
was
palmyra
even
today
the
site
of
that
city
bears
witness
to
her
greatness
ability
and
sovereignty
for
there
the
traveler
will
find
ruins
of
palaces
and
fortifications
of
the
utmost
strength
and
solidity
built
by
this
remarkable
woman
in
the
third
century
after
christ
she
was
the
wife
of
the
governorgeneral
of
athens
after
her
husbands
death
she
assumed
control
of
the
government
in
his
stead
and
ruled
her
province
most
efficiently
afterward
she
conquered
syria
subdued
egypt
and
founded
a
most
wonderful
kingdom
with
political
sagacity
and
thoroughness
the
roman
empire
sent
a
great
army
against
her
when
this
army
replete
with
martial
splendor
reached
syria
zenobia
herself
appeared
upon
the
field
leading
her
forces
on
the
day
of
battle
she
arrayed
herself
in
regal
garments
placed
a
crown
upon
her
head
and
rode
forth
sword
in
hand
to
meet
the
invading
legions
by
her
courage
and
military
strategy
the
roman
army
was
routed
and
so
completely
dispersed
that
they
were
not
able
to
reorganize
in
retreat
the
government
of
rome
held
consultation
saying
no
matter
what
commander
we
send
we
cannot
overcome
her
therefore
the
emperor
aurelian
himself
must
go
to
lead
the
legions
of
rome
against
zenobia
aurelian
marched
into
syria
with
two
hundred
thousand
soldiers
the
army
of
zenobia
was
greatly
inferior
in
size
the
romans
besieged
her
in
palmyra
two
years
without
success
finally
aurelian
was
able
to
cut
off
the
citys
supply
of
provisions
so
that
she
and
her
people
were
compelled
by
starvation
to
surrender
she
was
not
defeated
in
battle
aurelian
carried
her
captive
to
rome
on
the
day
of
his
entry
into
the
city
he
arranged
a
triumphal
processionfirst
elephants
then
lions
tigers
birds
monkeysand
after
the
monkeys
zenobia
a
crown
was
upon
her
head
a
chain
of
gold
about
her
neck
with
queenly
dignity
and
unconscious
of
humiliation
looking
to
the
right
and
left
she
said
verily
i
glory
in
being
a
woman
and
in
having
withstood
the
roman
empire
at
that
time
the
dominion
of
rome
covered
half
the
known
earth
and
this
chain
about
my
neck
is
a
sign
not
of
humiliation
but
of
glorification
this
is
a
symbol
of
my
power
not
of
my
defeat
among
other
historical
women
was
catherine
i
wife
of
peter
the
great
russia
and
turkey
were
at
war
muhammad
pasha
commander
of
the
turkish
forces
had
defeated
peter
and
was
about
to
take
st
petersburg
the
russians
were
in
a
most
critical
position
catherine
the
wife
of
peter
said
i
will
arrange
this
matter
she
had
an
interview
with
muhammad
pasha
negotiated
a
treaty
of
peace
and
induced
him
to
turn
back
she
saved
her
husband
and
her
nation
this
was
a
great
accomplishment
afterward
she
was
crowned
empress
of
russia
and
ruled
with
wisdom
until
her
death
the
discovery
of
america
by
columbus
was
during
the
reign
of
isabella
of
spain
to
whose
intelligence
and
assistance
this
wonderful
accomplishment
was
largely
due
in
brief
many
remarkable
women
have
appeared
in
the
history
of
the
world
but
further
mention
of
them
is
not
necessary
today
among
the
bahais
of
persia
there
are
many
women
who
are
the
very
pride
and
envy
of
the
men
they
are
imbued
with
all
the
virtues
and
excellences
of
humanity
they
are
eloquent
they
are
poets
and
scholars
and
embody
the
quintessence
of
humility
in
political
ability
and
acumen
they
have
been
able
to
cope
and
compete
with
representative
men
they
have
consecrated
their
lives
and
forfeited
their
possessions
in
martyrdom
for
the
sake
of
humanity
and
the
traces
of
their
glory
will
last
forever
the
pages
of
the
history
of
persia
are
illumined
by
the
lives
and
records
of
these
women
the
purpose
in
brief
is
this
that
if
woman
be
fully
educated
and
granted
her
rights
she
will
attain
the
capacity
for
wonderful
accomplishments
and
prove
herself
the
equal
of
man
she
is
the
coadjutor
of
man
his
complement
and
helpmeet
both
are
human
both
are
endowed
with
potentialities
of
intelligence
and
embody
the
virtues
of
humanity
in
all
human
powers
and
functions
they
are
partners
and
coequals
at
present
in
spheres
of
human
activity
woman
does
not
manifest
her
natal
prerogatives
owing
to
lack
of
education
and
opportunity
without
doubt
education
will
establish
her
equality
with
men
consider
the
animal
kingdom
where
no
distinction
is
observed
between
male
and
female
they
are
equal
in
powers
and
privileges
among
birds
of
the
air
no
distinction
is
evidenced
their
powers
are
equal
they
dwell
together
in
complete
unity
and
mutual
recognition
of
rights
shall
we
not
enjoy
the
same
equality
its
absence
is
not
befitting
to
mankind

is
the

it

science
is

the

of

inner
significances
of
the
heavenly

and

of

this
is
may
the
anniversary
of
the
message
and
declaration
of
the
bab
it
is
a
blessed
day
and
the
dawn
of
manifestation
for
the
appearance
of
the
bab
was
the
early
light
of
the
true
morn
whereas
the
manifestation
of
the
blessed
beauty
bahaullah
was
the
shining
forth
of
the
sun
therefore
it
is
a
blessed
day
the
inception
of
the
heavenly
bounty
the
beginning
of
the
divine
effulgence
on
this
day
in
the
bab
was
sent
forth
heralding
and
proclaiming
the
kingdom
of
god
announcing
the
glad
tidings
of
the
coming
of
bahaullah
and
withstanding
the
opposition
of
the
whole
persian
nation
some
of
the
persians
followed
him
for
this
they
suffered
the
most
grievous
difficulties
and
severe
ordeals
they
withstood
the
tests
with
wonderful
power
and
sublime
heroism
thousands
were
cast
into
prison
punished
persecuted
and
martyred
their
homes
were
pillaged
and
destroyed
their
possessions
confiscated
they
sacrificed
their
lives
most
willingly
and
remained
unshaken
in
their
faith
to
the
very
end
those
wonderful
souls
are
the
lamps
of
god
the
stars
of
sanctity
shining
gloriously
from
the
eternal
horizon
of
the
will
of
god
the
bab
was
subjected
to
bitter
persecution
in
shiraz
where
he
first
proclaimed
his
mission
and
message
a
period
of
famine
afflicted
that
region
and
the
bab
journeyed
to
isfahan
there
the
learned
men
rose
against
him
in
great
hostility
he
was
arrested
and
sent
to
tabriz
from
thence
he
was
transferred
to
maku
and
finally
imprisoned
in
the
strong
castle
of
chihriq
afterward
he
was
martyred
in
tabriz
this
is
merely
an
outline
of
the
history
of
the
bab
he
withstood
all
persecutions
and
bore
every
suffering
and
ordeal
with
unflinching
strength
the
more
his
enemies
endeavored
to
extinguish
that
flame
the
brighter
it
became
day
by
day
his
cause
spread
and
strengthened
during
the
time
when
he
was
among
the
people
he
was
constantly
heralding
the
coming
of
bahaullah
in
all
his
books
and
tablets
he
mentioned
bahaullah
and
announced
the
glad
tidings
of
his
manifestation
prophesying
that
he
would
reveal
himself
in
the
ninth
year
he
said
that
in
the
ninth
year
you
will
attain
to
all
happiness
in
the
ninth
year
you
will
be
blessed
with
the
meeting
of
the
promised
one
of
whom
i
have
spoken
he
mentioned
the
blessed
perfection
bahaullah
by
the
title
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
in
brief
that
blessed
soul
offered
his
very
life
in
the
pathway
of
bahaullah
even
as
it
is
recorded
in
historical
writings
and
records
in
his
first
book
the
best
of
stories
he
says
o
remnant
of
god
i
am
wholly
sacrificed
to
thee
i
am
content
with
curses
in
thy
path
i
crave
nought
but
to
be
slain
in
thy
love
and
god
the
supreme
sufficeth
as
an
eternal
protection
consider
how
the
bab
endured
difficulties
and
tribulations
how
he
gave
his
life
in
the
cause
of
god
how
he
was
attracted
to
the
love
of
the
blessed
beauty
bahaullah
and
how
he
announced
the
glad
tidings
of
his
manifestation
we
must
follow
his
heavenly
example
we
must
be
selfsacrificing
and
aglow
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
we
must
partake
of
the
bounty
and
grace
of
the
lord
for
the
bab
has
admonished
us
to
arise
in
service
to
the
cause
of
god
to
be
absolutely
severed
from
all
else
save
god
during
the
day
of
the
blessed
perfection
bahaullah
to
be
completely
attracted
by
the
love
of
bahaullah
to
love
all
humanity
for
his
sake
to
be
lenient
and
merciful
to
all
for
him
and
to
upbuild
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
therefore
this
day
may
is
the
anniversary
of
a
blessed
event

from
stenographic

creation
is
the
expression
of
motion
motion
is
life
a
moving
object
is
a
living
object
whereas
that
which
is
motionless
and
inert
is
as
dead
all
created
forms
are
progressive
in
their
planes
or
kingdoms
of
existence
under
the
stimulus
of
the
power
or
spirit
of
life
the
universal
energy
is
dynamic
nothing
is
stationary
in
the
material
world
of
outer
phenomena
or
in
the
inner
world
of
intellect
and
consciousness
religion
is
the
outer
expression
of
the
divine
reality
therefore
it
must
be
living
vitalized
moving
and
progressive
if
it
be
without
motion
and
nonprogressive
it
is
without
the
divine
life
it
is
dead
the
divine
institutes
are
continuously
active
and
evolutionary
therefore
the
revelation
of
them
must
be
progressive
and
continuous
all
things
are
subject
to
reformation
this
is
a
century
of
life
and
renewal
sciences
and
arts
industry
and
invention
have
been
reformed
law
and
ethics
have
been
reconstituted
reorganized
the
world
of

has
been
regenerated
sciences
of
former
ages
and
philosophies
of
the
past
are
useless
today
present
exigencies
demand
new
methods
of
solution
world
problems
are
without
precedent
old
ideas
and
modes
of
thought
are
fast
becoming
obsolete
ancient
laws
and
archaic
ethical
systems
will
not
meet
the
requirements
of
modern
conditions
for
this
is
clearly
the
century
of
a
new
life
the
century
of
the
revelation
of
reality
and
therefore
the
greatest
of
all
centuries
consider
how
the
scientific
developments
of
fifty
years
have
surpassed
and
eclipsed
the
knowledge
and
achievements
of
all
the
former
ages
combined
would
the
announcements
and
theories
of
ancient
astronomers
explain
our
present
knowledge
of
the
suns
and
planetary
systems
would
the
mask
of
obscurity
which
beclouded
medieval
centuries
meet
the
demand
for
cleareyed
vision
and
understanding
which
characterizes
the
world
today
will
the
despotism
of
former
governments
answer
the
call
for
freedom
which
has
risen
from
the
heart
of
humanity
in
this
cycle
of
illumination
it
is
evident
that
no
vital
results
are
now
forthcoming
from
the
customs
institutions
and
standpoints
of
the
past
in
view
of
this
shall
blind
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
and
theological
interpretations
continue
to
guide
and
control
the
religious
life
and
spiritual
development
of
humanity
today
shall
man
gifted
with
the
power
of
reason
unthinkingly
follow
and
adhere
to
dogma
creeds
and
hereditary
beliefs
which
will
not
bear
the
analysis
of
reason
in
this
century
of
effulgent
reality
unquestionably
this
will
not
satisfy
men
of
science
for
when
they
find
premise
or
conclusion
contrary
to
present
standards
of
proof
and
without
real
foundation
they
reject
that
which
has
been
formerly
accepted
as
standard
and
correct
and
move
forward
from
new
foundations
the
divine
prophets
have
revealed
and
founded
religion
they
have
laid
down
certain
laws
and
heavenly
principles
for
the
guidance
of
mankind
they
have
taught
and
promulgated
the
knowledge
of
god
established
praiseworthy
ethical
ideals
and
inculcated
the
highest
standards
of
virtues
in
the
human
world
gradually
these
heavenly
teachings
and
foundations
of
reality
have
been
beclouded
by
human
interpretations
and
dogmatic
imitations
of
ancestral
beliefs
the
essential
realities
which
the
prophets
labored
so
hard
to
establish
in
human
hearts
and
minds
while
undergoing
ordeals
and
suffering
tortures
of
persecution
have
now
well
nigh
vanished
some
of
these
heavenly
messengers
have
been
killed
some
imprisoned
all
of
them
despised
and
rejected
while
proclaiming
the
reality
of
divinity
soon
after
their
departure
from
this
world
the
essential
truth
of
their
teachings
was
lost
sight
of
and
dogmatic
imitations
adhered
to
inasmuch
as
human
interpretations
and
blind
imitations
differ
widely
religious
strife
and
disagreement
have
arisen
among
mankind
the
light
of
true
religion
has
been
extinguished
and
the
unity
of
the
world
of
humanity
destroyed
the
prophets
of
god
voiced
the
spirit
of
unity
and
agreement
they
have
been
the
founders
of
divine
reality
therefore
if
the
nations
of
the
world
forsake
imitations
and
investigate
the
reality
underlying
the
revealed
word
of
god
they
will
agree
and
become
reconciled
for
reality
is
one
and
not
multiple
the
nations
and
religions
are
steeped
in
blind
and
bigoted
imitations
a
man
is
a
jew
because
his
father
was
a
jew
the
muslim
follows
implicitly
the
footsteps
of
his
ancestors
in
belief
and
observance
the
buddhist
is
true
to
his
heredity
as
a
buddhist
that
is
to
say
they
profess
religious
belief
blindly
and
without
investigation
making
unity
and
agreement
impossible
it
is
evident
therefore
that
this
condition
will
not
be
remedied
without
a
reformation
in
the
world
of
religion
in
other
words
the
fundamental
reality
of
the
divine
religions
must
be
renewed
reformed
revoiced
to
mankind
from
the
seed
of
reality
religion
has
grown
into
a
tree
which
has
put
forth
leaves
and
branches
blossoms
and
fruit
after
a
time
this
tree
has
fallen
into
a
condition
of
decay
the
leaves
and
blossoms
have
withered
and
perished
the
tree
has
become
stricken
and
fruitless
it
is
not
reasonable
that
man
should
hold
to
the
old
tree
claiming
that
its
life
forces
are
undiminished
its
fruit
unequaled
its
existence
eternal
the
seed
of
reality
must
be
sown
again
in
human
hearts
in
order
that
a
new
tree
may
grow
therefrom
and
new
divine
fruits
refresh
the
world
by
this
means
the
nations
and
peoples
now
divergent
in
religion
will
be
brought
into
unity
imitations
will
be
forsaken
and
a
universal
brotherhood
in
reality
itself
will
be
established
warfare
and
strife
will
cease
among
mankind
all
will
be
reconciled
as
servants
of
god
for
all
are
sheltered
beneath
the
tree
of
his
providence
and
mercy
god
is
kind
to
all
he
is
the
giver
of
bounty
to
all
alike
even
as
jesus
christ
has
declared
that
god
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjustthat
is
to
say
the
mercy
of
god
is
universal
all
humanity
is
under
the
protection
of
his
love
and
favor
and
unto
all
he
has
pointed
the
way
of
guidance
and
progress
progress
is
of
two
kinds
material
and
spiritual
the
former
is
attained
through
observation
of
the
surrounding
existence
and
constitutes
the
foundation
of
civilization
spiritual
progress
is
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
is
the
awakening
of
the
conscious
soul
of
man
to
perceive
the
reality
of
divinity
material
progress
ensures
the
happiness
of
the
human
world
spiritual
progress
ensures
the
happiness
and
eternal
continuance
of
the
soul
the
prophets
of
god
have
founded
the
laws
of
divine
civilization
they
have
been
the
root
and
fundamental
source
of
all
knowledge
they
have
established
the
principles
of
human
brotherhood
of
fraternity
which
is
of
various
kindssuch
as
the
fraternity
of
family
of
race
of
nation
and
of
ethical
motives
these
forms
of
fraternity
these
bonds
of
brotherhood
are
merely
temporal
and
transient
in
association
they
do
not
ensure
harmony
and
are
usually
productive
of
disagreement
they
do
not
prevent
warfare
and
strife
on
the
contrary
they
are
selfish
restricted
and
fruitful
causes
of
enmity
and
hatred
among
mankind
the
spiritual
brotherhood
which
is
enkindled
and
established
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
unites
nations
and
removes
the
cause
of
warfare
and
strife
it
transforms
mankind
into
one
great
family
and
establishes
the
foundations
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
it
promulgates
the
spirit
of
international
agreement
and
ensures
universal
peace
therefore
we
must
investigate
the
foundation
of
this
heavenly
fraternity
we
must
forsake
all
imitations
and
promote
the
reality
of
the
divine
teachings
in
accordance
with
these
principles
and
actions
and
by
the
assistance
of
the
holy
spirit
both
material
and
spiritual
happiness
shall
become
realized
until
all
nations
and
peoples
become
united
by
the
bonds
of
the
holy
spirit
in
this
real
fraternity
until
national
and
international
prejudices
are
effaced
in
the
reality
of
this
spiritual
brotherhood
true
progress
prosperity
and
lasting
happiness
will
not
be
attained
by
man
this
is
the
century
of
new
and
universal
nationhood
sciences
have
advanced
industries
have
progressed
politics
have
been
reformed
liberty
has
been

justice
is

this
is
the
century
of
motion
divine
stimulus
and
accomplishment
the
century
of
human

and
altruistic

the

i
am
going
away
from
your
city
but
i
leave
my
heart
with
you
my
spirit
will
be
here
i
will
not
forget
you
i
ask
confirmation
for
you
from
the
kingdom
of
bahaullah
i
pray
that
you
may
advance
continually
in
spiritual
susceptibilities
that
day
by
day
you
may
grow
more
radiant
and
draw
nearer
to
god
until
you
become
instrumental
in
illumining
the
world
of
humanity
may
these
confirmations
of
the
kingdom
of
god
encompass
you
this
is
my
hope
my
prayer
in
the
estimation
of
historians
this
radiant
century
is
equivalent
to
one
hundred
centuries
of
the
past
if
comparison
be
made
with
the
sum
total
of
all
former
human
achievements
it
will
be
found
that
the
discoveries
scientific
advancement
and
material
civilization
of
this
present
century
have
equaled
yea
far
exceeded
the
progress
and
outcome
of
one
hundred
former
centuries
the
production
of
books
and
compilations
of
literature
alone
bears
witness
that
the
output
of
the
human
mind
in
this
century
has
been
greater
and
more
enlightening
than
all
the
past
centuries
together
it
is
evident
therefore
that
this
century
is
of
paramount
importance
reflect
upon
the
miracles
of
accomplishment
which
have
already
characterized
it
the
discoveries
in
every
realm
of
human
research
inventions
scientific
knowledge
ethical
reforms
and
regulations
established
for
the
welfare
of
humanity

day
by
day
discoveries
are
increasing
what
a
wonderful
century
this
is
it
is
an
age
of
universal
reformation
laws
and
statutes
of
civil
and
federal
governments
are
in
process
of
change
and
transformation
sciences
and
arts
are
being
molded
anew
thoughts
are
metamorphosed
the
foundations
of
human
society
are
changing
and
strengthening
today
sciences
of
the
past
are
useless
the
ptolemaic
system
of
astronomy
and
numberless
other
systems
and
theories
of
scientific
and
philosophical
explanation
are
discarded
known
to
be
false
and
worthless
ethical
precedents
and
principles
cannot
be
applied
to
the
needs
of
the
modern
world
thoughts
and
theories
of
past
ages
are
fruitless
now
thrones
and
governments
are
crumbling
and
falling
all
conditions
and
requisites
of
the
past
unfitted
and
inadequate
for
the
present
time
are
undergoing
radical
reform
it
is
evident
therefore
that
counterfeit
and
spurious
religious
teaching
antiquated
forms
of
belief
and
ancestral
imitations
which
are
at
variance
with
the
foundations
of
divine
reality
must
also
pass
away
and
be
reformed
they
must
be
abandoned
and
new
conditions
be
recognized
the
morals
of
humanity
must
undergo
change
new
remedies
and
solutions
for
human
problems
must
be
adopted
human
intellects
themselves
must
change
and
be
subject
to
the
universal
reformation
just
as
the
thoughts
and
hypotheses
of
past
ages
are
fruitless
today
likewise
dogmas
and
codes
of
human
invention
are
obsolete
and
barren
of
product
in
religion
nay
it
is
true
that
they
are
the
cause
of
enmity
and
conducive
to
strife
in
the
world
of
humanity
war
and
bloodshed
proceed
from
them
and
the
oneness
of
mankind
finds
no
recognition
in
their
observance
therefore
it
is
our
duty
in
this
radiant
century
to
investigate
the
essentials
of
divine
religion
seek
the
realities
underlying
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
discover
the
source
of
fellowship
and
agreement
which
will
unite
mankind
in
the
heavenly
bond
of
love
this
unity
is
the
radiance
of
eternity
the
divine
spirituality
the
effulgence
of
god
and
the
bounty
of
the
kingdom
we
must
investigate
the
divine
source
of
these
heavenly
bestowals
and
adhere
unto
them
steadfastly
for
if
we
remain
fettered
and
restricted
by
human
inventions
and
dogmas
day
by
day
the
world
of
mankind
will
be
degraded
day
by
day
warfare
and
strife
will
increase
and
satanic
forces
converge
toward
the
destruction
of
the
human
race
if
love
and
agreement
are
manifest
in
a
single
family
that
family
will
advance
become
illumined
and
spiritual
but
if
enmity
and
hatred
exist
within
it
destruction
and
dispersion
are
inevitable
this
is
likewise
true
of
a
city
if
those
who
dwell
within
it
manifest
a
spirit
of
accord
and
fellowship
it
will
progress
steadily
and
human
conditions
become
brighter
whereas
through
enmity
and
strife
it
will
be
degraded
and
its
inhabitants
scattered
in
the
same
way
the
people
of
a
nation
develop
and
advance
toward
civilization
and
enlightenment
through
love
and
accord
and
are
disintegrated
by
war
and
strife
finally
this
is
true
of
humanity
itself
in
the
aggregate
when
love
is
realized
and
the
ideal
spiritual
bonds
unite
the
hearts
of
men
the
whole
human
race
will
be
uplifted
the
world
will
continually
grow
more
spiritual
and
radiant
and
the
happiness
and
tranquillity
of
mankind
be
immeasurably
increased
warfare
and
strife
will
be
uprooted
disagreement
and
dissension
pass
away
and
universal
peace
unite
the
nations
and
peoples
of
the
world
all
mankind
will
dwell
together
as
one
family
blend
as
the
waves
of
one
sea
shine
as
stars
of
one
firmament
and
appear
as
fruits
of
the
same
tree
this
is
the
happiness
and
felicity
of
humankind
this
is
the
illumination
of
man
the
eternal
glory
and
everlasting
life
this
is
the
divine
bestowal
i
desire
this
station
for
you
and
i
pray
god
that
the
people
of
america
may
achieve
this
great
end
in
order
that
the
virtue
of
this
democracy
may
be
ensured
and
their
names
be
glorified
eternally
may
the
confirmations
of
god
uphold
them
in
all
things
and
their
memories
become
revered
throughout
the
east
and
the
west
may
they
become
the
servants
of
the
most
high
god
near
and
dear
to
him
in
the
oneness
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
bahaullah
endured
ordeals
and
hardships
sixty
years
there
was
no
persecution
vicissitude
or
suffering
he
did
not
experience
at
the
hand
of
his
enemies
and
oppressors
all
the
days
of
his
life
were
passed
in
difficulty
and
tribulationat
one
time
in
prison
another
in
exile
sometimes
in
chains
he
willingly
endured
these
difficulties
for
the
unity
of
mankind
praying
that
the
world
of
humanity
might
realize
the
radiance
of
god
the
oneness
of
humankind
become
a
reality
strife
and
warfare
cease
and
peace
and
tranquillity
be
realized
by
all
in
prison
he
hoisted
the
banner
of
human
solidarity
proclaiming
universal
peace
writing
to
the
kings
and
rulers
of
nations
summoning
them
to
international
unity
and
counseling
arbitration
his
life
was
a
vortex
of
persecution
and
difficulty
yet
catastrophes
extreme
ordeals
and
vicissitudes
did
not
hinder
the
accomplishment
of
his
work
and
mission
nay
on
the
contrary
his
power
became
greater
and
greater
his
efficiency
and
influence
spread
and
increased
until
his
glorious
light
shone
throughout
the
orient
love
and
unity
were
established
and
the
differing
religions
found
a
center
of
contact
and
reconciliation
therefore
we
also
must
strive
in
this
pathway
of
love
and
service
sacrificing
life
and
possessions
passing
our
days
in
devotion
consecrating
our
efforts
wholly
to
the
cause
of
god
so
that
god
willing
the
ensign
of
universal
religion
may
be
uplifted
in
the
world
of
mankind
and
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
be
established
in
your
hearts
i
have
beheld
the
reflection
of
a
great
and
wonderful
love
the
americans
have
shown
me
uniform
kindness
and
i
entertain
a
deep
spiritual
love
for
them
i
am
pleased
with
the
susceptibilities
of
your
hearts
i
will
pray
for
you
asking
divine
assistance
and
then
say
farewell
o
my
god
o
my
god
verily
these
servants
are
turning
to
thee
supplicating
thy
kingdom
of
mercy
verily
they
are
attracted
by
thy
holiness
and
set
aglow
with
the
fire
of
thy
love
seeking
confirmation
from
thy
wondrous
kingdom
and
hoping
for
attainment
in
thy

verily
they
long
for

notes
by
esther
foster
as
i
entered
the
church
this
evening
i
heard
the
hymn
nearer
my
god
to
thee
the
greatest
attainment
in
the
world
of
humanity
is
nearness
to
god
every
lasting
glory
honor
grace
and
beauty
which
comes
to
man
comes
through
nearness
to
god
all
the
prophets
and
apostles
longed
and
prayed
for
nearness
to
the
creator
how
many
nights
they
passed
in
sleepless
yearning
for
this
station
how
many
days
they
devoted
to
supplication
for
this
attainment
seeking
ever
to
draw
nigh
unto
him
but
nearness
to
god
is
not
an
easy
accomplishment
during
the
time
jesus
christ
was
upon
the
earth
mankind
sought
nearness
to
god
but
in
that
day
no
one
attained
it
save
a
very
fewhis
disciples
those
blessed
souls
were
confirmed
with
divine
nearness
through
the
love
of
god
divine
nearness
is
dependent
upon
attainment
to
the
knowledge
of
god
upon
severance
from
all
else
save
god
it
is
contingent
upon
selfsacrifice
and
to
be
found
only
through
forfeiting
wealth
and
worldly
possessions
it
is
made
possible
through
the
baptism
of
water
and
fire
revealed
in
the
gospels
water
symbolizes
the
water
of
life
which
is
knowledge
and
fire
is
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
therefore
man
must
be
baptized
with
the
water
of
life
the
holy
spirit
and
the
fire
of
the
love
of
the
kingdom
until
he
attains
these
three
degrees
nearness
to
god
is
not
possible
this
is
the
process
by
which
the
bahais
of
persia
have
attained
it
they
gave
their
lives
for
this
station
sacrificed
honor
comfort
and
possessions
hastened
with
the
utmost
joy
to
the
place
of
martyrdom
their
blood
was
spilled
their
bodies
were
tortured
and
destroyed
their
homes
pillaged
their
children
carried
into
captivity
they
endured
all
these
conditions
joyfully
and
willingly
through
such
sacrifice
nearness
to
god
is
made
possible
and
be
it
known
that
this
nearness
is
not
dependent
upon
time
or
place
nearness
to
god
is
dependent
upon
purity
of
the
heart
and
exhilaration
of
the
spirit
through
the
glad
tidings
of
the
kingdom
consider
how
a
pure
wellpolished
mirror
fully
reflects
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
no
matter
how
distant
the
sun
may
be
as
soon
as
the
mirror
is
cleaned
and
purified
the
sun
will
manifest
itself
the
more
pure
and
sanctified
the
heart
of
man
becomes
the
nearer
it
draws
to
god
and
the
light
of
the
sun
of
reality
is
revealed
within
it
this
light
sets
hearts
aglow
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
opens
in
them
the
doors
of
knowledge
and
unseals
the
divine
mysteries
so
that
spiritual
discoveries
are
made
possible
all
the
prophets
have
drawn
near
to
god
through
severance
we
must
emulate
those
holy
souls
and
renounce
our
own
wishes
and
desires
we
must
purify
ourselves
from
the
mire
and
soil
of
earthly
contact
until
our
hearts
become
as
mirrors
in
clearness
and
the
light
of
the
most
great
guidance
reveals
itself
in
them
bahaullah
proclaims
in
the
hidden
words
that
god
inspires
his
servants
and
is
revealed
through
them
he
says
thy
heart
is
my
home
sanctify
it
for
my
descent
thy
spirit
is
my
place
of
revelation
cleanse
it
for
my
manifestation
therefore
we
learn
that
nearness
to
god
is
possible
through
devotion
to
him
through
entrance
into
the
kingdom
and
service
to
humanity
it
is
attained
by
unity
with
mankind
and
through
lovingkindness
to
all
it
is
dependent
upon
investigation
of
truth
acquisition
of
praiseworthy
virtues
service
in
the
cause
of
universal
peace
and
personal
sanctification
in
a
word
nearness
to
god
necessitates
sacrifice
of
self
severance
and
the
giving
up
of
all
to
him
nearness
is
likeness
behold
how
the
sun
shines
upon
all
creation
but
only
surfaces
that
are
pure
and
polished
can
reflect
its
glory
and
light
the
darkened
soul
has
no
portion
of
the
revelation
of
the
glorious
effulgence
of
reality
and
the
soil
of
self
unable
to
take
advantage
of
that
light
does
not
produce
growth
the
eyes
of
the
blind
cannot
behold
the
rays
of
the
sun
only
pure
eyes
with
sound
and
perfect
sight
can
receive
them
green
and
living
trees
can
absorb
the
bounty
of
the
sun
dead
roots
and
withered
branches
are
destroyed
by
it
therefore
man
must
seek
capacity
and
develop
readiness
as
long
as
he
lacks
susceptibility
to
divine
influences
he
is
incapable
of
reflecting
the
light
and
assimilating
its
benefits
sterile
soil
will
produce
nothing
even
if
the
cloud
of
mercy
pours
rain
upon
it
a
thousand
years
we
must
make
the
soil
of
our
hearts
receptive
and
fertile
by
tilling
in
order
that
the
rain
of
divine
mercy
may
refresh
them
and
bring
forth
roses
and
hyacinths
of
heavenly
planting
we
must
have
perceiving
eyes
in
order
to
see
the
light
of
the
sun
we
must
cleanse
the
nostril
in
order
to
scent
the
fragrances
of
the
divine
rose
garden
we
must
render
the
ears
attentive
in
order
to
hear
the
summons
of
the
supreme
kingdom
no
matter
how
beautiful
the
melody
the
ear
that
is
deaf
cannot
hear
it
cannot
receive
the
call
of
the
supreme
concourse
the
nostril
that
is
clogged
with
dust
cannot
inhale
the
fragrant
odors
of
the
blossoms
therefore
we
must
ever
strive
for
capacity
and
seek
readiness
as
long
as
we
lack
susceptibility
the
beauties
and
bounties
of
god
cannot
penetrate
christ
spoke
a
parable
in
which
he
said
his
words
were
like
the
seeds
of
the
sower
some
fall
upon
stony
ground
some
upon
sterile
soil
some
are
choked
by
thorns
and
thistles
but
some
fall
upon
the
ready
receptive
and
fertile
ground
of
human
hearts
when
seeds
are
cast
upon
sterile
soil
no
growth
follows
those
cast
upon
stony
ground
will
grow
a
short
time
but
lacking
deep
roots
will
wither
away
thorns
and
thistles
destroy
others
completely
but
the
seed
cast
in
good
ground
brings
forth
harvest
and
fruitage
in
the
same
way
the
words
i
speak
to
you
here
tonight
may
produce
no
effect
whatever
some
hearts
may
be
affected
then
soon
forget
others
owing
to
superstitious
ideas
and
imaginations
may
even
fail
to
hear
and
understand
but
the
blessed
souls
who
are
attentive
to
my
exhortation
and
admonition
listening
with
the
ear
of
acceptance
allowing
my
words
to
penetrate
effectively
will
advance
day
by
day
toward
full
fruition
yea
even
to
the
supreme
concourse
consider
how
the
parable
makes
attainment
dependent
upon
capacity
unless
capacity
is
developed
the
summons
of
the
kingdom
cannot
reach
the
ear
the
light
of
the
sun
of
truth
will
not
be
observed
and
the
fragrances
of
the
rose
garden
of
inner
significance
will
be
lost
let
us
endeavor
to
attain
capacity
susceptibility
and
worthiness
that
we
may
hear
the
call
of
the
glad
tidings
of
the
kingdom
become
revivified
by
the
breaths
of
the
holy

foster
the
fatherhood
of
god
his
lovingkindness
and
beneficence
are
apparent
to
all
in
his
mercy
he
provides
fully
and
amply
for
his
creatures
and
if
any
soul
sins
he
does
not
suspend
his
bounty
all
created
things
are
visible
manifestations
of
his
fatherhood
mercy
and
heavenly

human
brotherhood
is
likewise
as
clear
and
evident
as
the
sun
for
all
are
servants
of
one

belong
to
one
humankind
inhabit
the
same
globe
are
sheltered
beneath
the
overshadowing
dome
of
heaven
and
submerged
in
the
sea
of
divine
mercy
human
brotherhood
and
dependence
exist
because
mutual
helpfulness
and
cooperation
are
the
two
necessary
principles
underlying
human
welfare
this
is
the
physical
relationship
of
mankind
there
is
another
brotherhoodthe
spiritualwhich
is
higher
holier
and
superior
to
all
others
it
is
heavenly
it
emanates
from
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
the
effulgence
of
merciful
attributes
it
is
founded
upon
spiritual
susceptibilities
this
brotherhood
is
established
by
the
manifestations
of
the
holy
one
the
divine
manifestations
since
the
day
of
adam
have
striven
to
unite
humanity
so
that
all
may
be
accounted
as
one
soul
the
function
and
purpose
of
a
shepherd
is
to
gather
and
not
disperse
his
flock
the
prophets
of
god
have
been
divine
shepherds
of
humanity
they
have
established
a
bond
of
love
and
unity
among
mankind
made
scattered
peoples
one
nation
and
wandering
tribes
a
mighty
kingdom
they
have
laid
the
foundation
of
the
oneness
of
god
and
summoned
all
to
universal
peace
all
these
holy
divine
manifestations
are
one
they
have
served
one
god
promulgated
the
same
truth
founded
the
same
institutions
and
reflected
the
same
light
their
appearances
have
been
successive
and
correlated
each
one
has
announced
and
extolled
the
one
who
was
to
follow
and
all
laid
the
foundation
of
reality
they
summoned
and
invited
the
people
to
love
and
made
the
human
world
a
mirror
of
the
word
of
god
therefore
the
divine
religions
they
established
have
one
foundation
their
teachings
proofs
and
evidences
are
one
in
name
and
form
they
differ
but
in
reality
they
agree
and
are
the
same
these
holy
manifestations
have
been
as
the
coming
of
springtime
in
the
world
although
the
springtime
of
this
year
is
designated
by
another
name
according
to
the
changing
calendar
yet
as
regards
its
life
and
quickening
it
is
the
same
as
the
springtime
of
last
year
for
each
spring
is
the
time
of
a
new
creation
the
effects
bestowals
perfections
and
lifegiving
forces
of
which
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
former
vernal
seasons
although
the
names
are
many
and
various
this
is
last
year
was
and
so
on
but
in
fundamental
reality
no
difference
is
apparent
the
sun
is
one
but
the
dawning
points
of
the
sun
are
numerous
and
changing
the
ocean
is
one
body
of
water
but
different
parts
of
it
have
particular
designationsatlantic
pacific
mediterranean
antarctic
etc
if
we
consider
the
names
there
is
differentiation
but
the
water
the
ocean
itself
is
one
reality
likewise
the
divine
religions
of
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
are
in
reality
one
though
in
name
and
nomenclature
they
differ
man
must
be
a
lover
of
the
light
no
matter
from
what
dayspring
it
may
appear
he
must
be
a
lover
of
the
rose
no
matter
in
what
soil
it
may
be
growing
he
must
be
a
seeker
of
the
truth
no
matter
from
what
source
it
come
attachment
to
the
lantern
is
not
loving
the
light
attachment
to
the
earth
is
not
befitting
but
enjoyment
of
the
rose
which
develops
from
the
soil
is
worthy
devotion
to
the
tree
is
profitless
but
partaking
of
the
fruit
is
beneficial
luscious
fruits
no
matter
upon
what
tree
they
grow
or
where
they
may
be
found
must
be
enjoyed
the
word
of
truth
no
matter
which
tongue
utters
it
must
be
sanctioned
absolute
verities
no
matter
in
what
book
they
be
recorded
must
be
accepted
if
we
harbor
prejudice
it
will
be
the
cause
of
deprivation
and
ignorance
the
strife
between
religions
nations
and
races
arises
from
misunderstanding
if
we
investigate
the
religions
to
discover
the
principles
underlying
their
foundations
we
will
find
they
agree
for
the
fundamental
reality
of
them
is
one
and
not
multiple
by
this
means
the
religionists
of
the
world
will
reach
their
point
of
unity
and
reconciliation
they
will
ascertain
the
truth
that
the
purpose
of
religion
is
the
acquisition
of
praiseworthy
virtues
the
betterment
of
morals
the
spiritual
development
of
mankind
the
real
life
and
divine
bestowals
all
the
prophets
have
been
the
promoters
of
these
principles
none
of
them
has
been
the
promoter
of
corruption
vice
or
evil
they
have
summoned
mankind
to
all
good
they
have
united
people
in
the
love
of
god
invited
them
to
the
religions
of
the
unity
of
mankind
and
exhorted
them
to
amity
and
agreement
for
example
we
mention
abraham
and
moses
by
this
mention
we
do
not
mean
the
limitation
implied
in
the
mere
names
but
intend
the
virtues
which
these
names
embody
when
we
say
abraham
we
mean
thereby
a
manifestation
of
divine
guidance
a
center
of
human
virtues
a
source
of
heavenly
bestowals
to
mankind
a
dawning
point
of
divine
inspiration
and
perfections
these
perfections
and
graces
are
not
limited
to
names
and
boundaries
when
we
find
these
virtues
qualities
and
attributes
in
any
personality
we
recognize
the
same
reality
shining
from
within
and
bow
in
acknowledgment
of
the
abrahamic
perfections
similarly
we
acknowledge
and
adore
the
beauty
of
moses
some
souls
were
lovers
of
the
name
abraham
loving
the
lantern
instead
of
the
light
and
when
they
saw
this
same
light
shining
from
another
lantern
they
were
so
attached
to
the
former
lantern
that
they
did
not
recognize
its
later
appearance
and
illumination
therefore
those
who
were
attached
and
held
tenaciously
to
the
name
abraham
were
deprived
when
the
abrahamic
virtues
reappeared
in
moses
similarly
the
jews
were
believers
in
moses
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
messiah
the
virtues
and
perfections
of
moses
became
apparent
in
jesus
christ
most
effulgently
but
the
jews
held
to
the
name
moses
not
adoring
the
virtues
and
perfections
manifest
in
him
had
they
been
adoring
these
virtues
and
seeking
these
perfections
they
would
assuredly
have
believed
in
jesus
christ
when
the
same
virtues
and
perfections
shone
in
him
if
we
are
lovers
of
the
light
we
adore
it
in
whatever
lamp
it
may
become
manifest
but
if
we
love
the
lamp
itself
and
the
light
is
transferred
to
another
lamp
we
will
neither
accept
nor
sanction
it
therefore
we
must
follow
and
adore
the
virtues
revealed
in
the
messengers
of
godwhether
in
abraham
moses
jesus
or
other
prophetsbut
we
must
not
adhere
to
and
adore
the
lamp
we
must
recognize
the
sun
no
matter
from
what
dawning
point
it
may
shine
forth
be
it
mosaic
abrahamic
or
any
personal
point
of
orientation
whatever
for
we
are
lovers
of
sunlight
and
not
of
orientation
we
are
lovers
of
illumination
and
not
of
lamps
and
candles
we
are
seekers
for
water
no
matter
from
what
rock
it
may
gush
forth
we
are
in
need
of
fruit
in
whatsoever
orchard
it
may
be
ripened
we
long
for
rain
it
matters
not
which
cloud
pours
it
down
we
must
not
be
fettered
if
we
renounce
these
fetters
we
shall
agree
for
all
are
seekers
of
reality
the
counterfeit
or
imitation
of
true
religion
has
adulterated
human
belief
and
the
foundations
have
been
lost
sight
of
the
variance
of
these
imitations
has
produced
enmity
and
strife
war
and
bloodshed
now
the
glorious
and
brilliant
twentieth
century
has
dawned
and
the
divine
bounty
is
radiating
universally
the
sun
of
truth
is
shining
forth
in
intense
enkindlement
this
is
verily
the
century
when
these
imitations
must
be
forsaken
superstitions
abandoned
and
god
alone
worshiped
we
must
look
at
the
reality
of
the
prophets
and
their
teachings
in
order
that
we
may
agree
praise
be
to
god
the
springtime
of
god
is
at
hand
this
century
is
verily
the
spring
season
the
world
of
mind
and
kingdom
of
soul
have
become
fresh
and
verdant
by
its
bestowals
it
has
resuscitated
the
whole
realm
of
existence
on
one
hand
the
lights
of
reality
are
shining
on
the
other
the
clouds
of
divine
mercy
are
pouring
down
the
fullness
of
heavenly
bounty
wonderful
material
progress
is
evident
and
great
spiritual
discoveries
are
being
made
truly
this
can
be
called
the
miracle
of
centuries
for
it
is
replete
with
manifestations
of
the
miraculous
the
time
has
come
when
all
mankind
shall
be
united
when
all
races
shall
be
loyal
to
one
fatherland
all
religions
become
one
religion
and
racial
and
religious
bias
pass
away
it
is
a
day
in
which
the
oneness
of
humankind
shall
uplift
its
standard
and
international
peace
like
the
true
morning
flood
the
world
with
its
light
therefore
we
offer
supplications
to
god
asking
him
to
dispel
these
gloomy
clouds
and
uproot
these
imitations
in
order
that
the
east
and
west
may
become
radiant
with
love
and
unity
that
the
nations
of
the
world
shall
embrace
each
other
and
the
ideal
spiritual
brotherhood
illumine
the
world
like
the
glorious
sun
of
the
high
heavens
this
is
our
hope
our
wish
and
desire
we
pray
that
through
the
bounty
and
grace
of
god
we
may
attain
thereto
i
am
very
happy
to
be
present
at
this
meeting
which
has
innate
radiance
intelligence
perception
and
longing
to
investigate
reality
such
meetings
are
the
glory
of
the
world
of
mankind
i
ask
the
blessing
of
god
in
your
behalf

notes
by
howard
macnutt
the
divine
manifestations
have
been
iconoclastic
in
their
teachings
uprooting
error
destroying
false
religious
beliefs
and
summoning
mankind
anew
to
the
fundamental
oneness
of
god
all
of
them
have
likewise
proclaimed
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
essential
teaching
of
moses
was
the
law
of
sinai
the
ten
commandments
christ
renewed
and
again
revealed
the
commands
of
the
one
god
and
precepts
of
human
action
in
muhammad
although
the
circle
was
wider
the
intention
of
his
teaching
was
likewise
to
uplift
and
unify
humanity
in
the
knowledge
of
the
one
god
in
the
bab
the
circle
was
again
very
much
enlarged
but
the
essential
teaching
was
the
same
the
books
of
bahaullah
number
more
than
one
hundred
each
one
is
an
evident
proof
sufficient
for
mankind
each
one
from
foundation
to
apex
proclaims
the
essential
unity
of
god
and
humanity
the
love
of
god
the
abolition
of
war
and
the
divine
standard
of
peace
each
one
also
inculcates
divine
morality
the
manifestation
of
lordly
gracesin
every
word
a
book
of
meanings
for
the
word
of
god
is
collective
wisdom
absolute
knowledge
and
eternal
truth
consider
the
statement
recorded
in
the
first
chapter
of
the
book
of
john
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
this
statement
is
brief
but
replete
with
the
greatest
meanings
its
applications
are
illimitable
and
beyond
the
power
of
books
or
words
to
contain
and
express
heretofore
the
doctors
of
theology
have
not
expounded
it
but
have
restricted
it
to
jesus
as
the
word
made
flesh
the
separation
of
jesus
from
god
the
father
and
his
descent
upon
the
earth
in
this
way
the
individualized
separation
of
the
godhead
came
to
be
taught
the
essential
oneness
of
father
son
and
spirit
has
many
meanings
and
constitutes
the
foundation
of
christianity
today
we
will
merely
give
a
synopsis
of
explanation
why
was
jesus
the
word
in
the
universe
of
creation
all
phenomenal
beings
are
as
letters
letters
in
themselves
are
meaningless
and
express
nothing
of
thought
or
idealas
for
instance
a
b
etc
likewise
all
phenomenal
beings
are
without
independent
meaning
but
a
word
is
composed
of
letters
and
has
independent
sense
and
meaning
therefore
as
christ
conveyed
the
perfect
meaning
of
divine
reality
and
embodied
independent
significance
he
was
the
word
he
was
as
the
station
of
reality
compared
to
the
station
of
metaphor
there
is
no
intrinsic
meaning
in
the
leaves
of
a
book
but
the
thought
they
convey
leads
you
to
reflect
upon
reality
the
reality
of
jesus
was
the
perfect
meaning
the
christhood
in
him
which
in
the
holy
books
is
symbolized
as
the
word
the
word
was
with
god
the
christhood
means
not
the
body
of
jesus
but
the
perfection
of
divine
virtues
manifest
in
him
therefore
it
is
written
he
is
god
this
does
not
imply
separation
from
god
even
as
it
is
not
possible
to
separate
the
rays
of
the
sun
from
the
sun
the
reality
of
christ
was
the
embodiment
of
divine
virtues
and
attributes
of
god
for
in
divinity
there
is
no
duality
all
adjectives
nouns
and
pronouns
in
that
court
of
sanctity
are
one
there
is
neither
multiplicity
nor
division
the
intention
of
this
explanation
is
to
show
that
the
words
of
god
have
innumerable
significances
and
mysteries
of
meaningseach
one
a
thousand
and
more
the
tablets
of
bahaullah
are
many
the
precepts
and
teachings
they
contain
are
universal
covering
every
subject
he
has
revealed
scientific
explanations
ranging
throughout
all
the
realms
of
human
inquiry
and
investigationastronomy
biology
medical
science
etc
in
the
kitabiiqan
he
has
given
expositions
of
the
meanings
of
the
gospel
and
other
heavenly
books
he
wrote
lengthy
tablets
upon
civilization
sociology
and
government
every
subject
is
considered
his
tablets
are
matchless
in
beauty
and
profundity
even
his
enemies
acknowledge
the
greatness
of
bahaullah
saying
he
was
the
miracle
of
humanity
this
was
their
confession
although
they
did
not
believe
in
him
he
was
eulogized
by
christians
jews
zoroastrians
and
muslims
who
denied
his
claim
they
frequently
said
he
is
matchless
unique
a
christian
poet
in
the
orient
wrote
do
not
believe
him
a
manifestation
of
god
yet
his
miracles
are
as
great
as
the
sun
mirza
abulfadl
has
mentioned
many
poems
of
this
kind
and
there
are
numerous
others
the
testimony
of
his
enemies
witnessed
that
he
was
the
miracle
of
mankind
that
he
walked
in
a
special
pathway
of
knowledge
and
was
peerless
in
personality
his
teachings
are
universal
and
the
standard
for
human
action
they
are
not
merely
theoretical
and
intended
to
remain
in
books
they
are
the
principles
of
action
results
follow
action
mere
theory
is
fruitless
of
what
use
is
a
book
upon
medicine
if
it
is
never
taken
from
the
library
shelf
when
practical
activity
has
been
manifested
the
teachings
of
god
have
borne
fruit
the
great
and
fundamental
teachings
of
bahaullah
are
the
oneness
of
god
and
unity
of
mankind
this
is
the
bond
of
union
among
bahais
all
over
the
world
they
become
united
among
themselves
then
unite
others
it
is
impossible
to
unite
unless
united
christ
said
ye
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
but
if
the
salt
has
lost
his
savour
wherewith
shall
it
be
salted
this
proves
there
were
dissensions
and
lack
of
unity
among
his
followers
hence
his
admonition
to
unity
of
action
now
must
we
likewise
bind
ourselves
together
in
the
utmost
unity
be
kind
and
loving
to
each
other
sacrificing
all
our
possessions
our
honor
yea
even
our
lives
for
each
other
then
will
it
be
proved
that
we
have
acted
according
to
the
teachings
of
god
that
we
have
been
real
believers
in
the
oneness
of
god
and
unity
of
mankind

i
am
greatly
pleased
with
these
expressions
of
kindly
feeling
and
evidences
of
spiritual
susceptibility
tonight
i
am
very
happy
in
the
realization
that
our
aims
and
purposes
are
the
same
our
desires
and
longings
are
one
this
is
a
reflection
and
evidence
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
the
intention
toward
accomplishment
of
the
most
great
peace
therefore
we
are
united
in
will
and
purpose
in
the
world
of
existence
there
are
no
greater
questions
than
these
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
ensures
the
glorification
of
man
international
peace
is
the
assurance
of
the
welfare
of
all
humankind
there
are
no
greater
motives
and
purposes
in
the
human
soul
as
we
are
agreed
upon
them
the
certainty
of
unity
and
concord
between
bahais
and
theosophists
is
most
hopeful
their
purposes
are
one
their
desires
one
and
spiritual
susceptibilities
are
common
to
both
their
attention
is
devoted
to
the
divine
kingdom
they
partake
alike
of
its
bounty
today
the
human
world
is
in
need
of
a
great
power
by
which
these
glorious
principles
and
purposes
may
be
executed
the
cause
of
peace
is
a
very
great
cause
it
is
the
cause
of
god
and
all
the
forces
of
the
world
are
opposed
to
it
governments
for
instance
consider
militarism
as
the
step
to
human
progress
that
division
among
men
and
nations
is
the
cause
of
patriotism
and
honor
that
if
one
nation
attack
and
conquer
another
gaining
wealth
territory
and
glory
thereby
this
warfare
and
conquest
this
bloodshed
and
cruelty
are
the
cause
of
that
victorious
nations
advancement
and
prosperity
this
is
an
utter
mistake
compare
the
nations
of
the
world
to
the
members
of
a
family
a
family
is
a
nation
in
miniature
simply
enlarge
the
circle
of
the
household
and
you
have
the
nation
enlarge
the
circle
of
nations
and
you
have
all
humanity
the
conditions
surrounding
the
family
surround
the
nation
the
happenings
in
the
family
are
the
happenings
in
the
life
of
the
nation
would
it
add
to
the
progress
and
advancement
of
a
family
if
dissensions
should
arise
among
its
members
all
fighting
pillaging
each
other
jealous
and
revengeful
of
injury
seeking
selfish
advantage
nay
this
would
be
the
cause
of
the
effacement
of
progress
and
advancement
so
it
is
in
the
great
family
of
nations
for
nations
are
but
an
aggregate
of
families
therefore
as
strife
and
dissension
destroy
a
family
and
prevent
its
progress
so
nations
are
destroyed
and
advancement
hindered
all
the
heavenly
books
divine
prophets
sages
and
philosophers
agree
that
warfare
is
destructive
to
human
development
and
peace
constructive
they
agree
that
war
and
strife
strike
at
the
foundations
of
humanity
therefore
a
power
is
needed
to
prevent
war
and
to
proclaim
and
establish
the
oneness
of
humanity
but
knowledge
of
the
need
of
this
power
is
not
sufficient
realizing
that
wealth
is
desirable
is
not
becoming
wealthy
the
admission
that
scientific
attainment
is
praiseworthy
does
not
confer
scientific
knowledge
acknowledgment
of
the
excellence
of
honor
does
not
make
a
man
honorable
knowledge
of
human
conditions
and
the
needed
remedy
for
them
is
not
the
cause
of
their
betterment
to
admit
that
health
is
good
does
not
constitute
health
a
skilled
physician
is
needed
to
remedy
existing
human
conditions
as
a
physician
is
required
to
have
complete
knowledge
of
pathology
diagnosis
therapeutics
and
treatment
so
this
world
physician
must
be
wise
skillful
and
capable
before
health
will
result
his
mere
knowledge
is
not
health
it
must
be
applied
and
the
remedy
carried
out
the
attainment
of
any
object
is
conditioned
upon
knowledge
volition
and
action
unless
these
three
conditions
are
forthcoming
there
is
no
execution
or
accomplishment
in
the
erection
of
a
house
it
is
first
necessary
to
know
the
ground
and
design
the
house
suitable
for
it
second
to
obtain
the
means
or
funds
necessary
for
the
construction
third
actually
to
build
it
therefore
a
power
is
needed
to
carry
out
and
execute
what
is
known
and
admitted
to
be
the
remedy
for
human
conditionsnamely
the
unification
of
mankind
furthermore
it
is
evident
that
this
cannot
be
realized
through
material
process
and
means
the
accomplishment
of
this
unification
cannot
be
through
racial
power
for
races
are
different
and
diverse
in
tendencies
it
cannot
be
through
patriotic
power
for
nationalities
are
unlike
nor
can
it
be
effected
through
political
power
since
the
policies
of
governments
and
nations
are
various
that
is
to
say
any
effort
toward
unification
through
these
material
means
would
benefit
one
and
injure
another
because
of
unequal
and
individual
interests
some
may
believe
this
great
remedy
can
be
found
in
dogmatic
insistence
upon
imitations
and
interpretations
this
would
likewise
be
without
foundation
and
result
therefore
it
is
evident
that
no
means
but
an
ideal
means
a
spiritual
power
divine
bestowals
and
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
will
heal
this
world
sickness
of
war
dissension
and
discord
nothing
else
is
possible
nothing
can
be
conceived
of
but
through
spiritual
means
and
the
divine
power
it
is
possible
and
practicable
consider
history
what
has
brought
unity
to
nations
morality
to
peoples
and
benefits
to
mankind
if
we
reflect
upon
it
we
will
find
that
establishing
the
divine
religions
has
been
the
greatest
means
toward
accomplishing
the
oneness
of
humanity
the
foundation
of
divine
reality
in
religion
has
done
this
not
imitations
of
ancestral
religious
forms
imitations
are
opposed
to
each
other
and
have
ever
been
the
cause
of
strife
enmity
jealousy
and
war
the
divine
religions
are
collective
centers
in
which
diverse
standpoints
may
meet
agree
and
unify
they
accomplish
oneness
of
native
lands
races
and
policies
for
instance
christ
united
various
nations
brought
peace
to
warring
peoples
and
established
the
oneness
of
humankind
the
conquering
greeks
and
romans
the
prejudiced
egyptians
and
assyrians
were
all
in
a
condition
of
strife
enmity
and
war
but
christ
gathered
these
varied
peoples
together
and
removed
the
foundations
of
discordnot
through
racial
patriotic
or
political
power
but
through
divine
power
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
this
was
not
otherwise
possible
all
other
efforts
of
men
and
nations
remain
as
mere
mention
in
history
without
accomplishment
as
this
great
result
is
contingent
upon
divine
power
and
bestowals
where
shall
the
world
obtain
that
power
god
is
eternal
and
ancientnot
a
new
god
his
sovereignty
is
of
old
not
recentnot
merely
existent
these
five
or
six
thousand
years
this
infinite
universe
is
from
everlasting
the
sovereignty
power
names
and
attributes
of
god
are
eternal
ancient
his
names
presuppose
creation
and
predicate
his
existence
and
will
we
say
god
is
creator
this
name
creator
appears
when
we
connote
creation
we
say
god
is
the
provider
this
name
presupposes
and
proves
the
existence
of
the
provided
god
is
love
this
name
proves
the
existence
of
the
beloved
in
the
same
way
god
is
mercy
god
is
justice
god
is
life
etc
therefore
as
god
is
creator
eternal
and
ancient
there
were
always
creatures
and
subjects
existing
and
provided
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
divine
sovereignty
is
eternal
sovereignty
necessitates
subjects
ministers
trustees
and
others
subordinate
to
sovereignty
could
there
be
a
king
without
country
subjects
and
armies
if
we
conceive
of
a
time
when
there
were
no
creatures
no
servants
no
subjects
of
divine
lordship
we
dethrone
god
and
predicate
a
time
when
god
was
not
it
would
be
as
if
he
had
been
recently
appointed
and
man
had
given
these
names
to
him
the
divine
sovereignty
is
ancient
eternal
god
from
everlasting
was
love
justice
power
creator
provider
the
omniscient
the
bountiful
as
the
divine
entity
is
eternal
the
divine
attributes
are
coexistent
coeternal
the
divine
bestowals
are
therefore
without
beginning
without
end
god
is
infinite
the
works
of
god
are
infinite
the
bestowals
of
god
are
infinite
as
his
divinity
is
eternal
his
lordship
and
perfections
are
without
end
as
the
bounty
of
the
holy
spirit
is
eternal
we
can
never
say
that
his
bestowals
terminate
else
he
terminates
if
we
think
of
the
sun
and
then
try
to
conceive
of
the
cessation
of
the
solar
flame
and
heat
we
have
predicated
the
nonexistence
of
the
sun
for
separation
of
the
sun
from
its
rays
and
heat
is
inconceivable
therefore
if
we
limit
the
bestowals
of
god
we
limit
the
attributes
of
god
and
limit
god
let
us
then
trust
in
the
bounty
and
bestowal
of
god
let
us
be
exhilarated
with
the
divine
breath
illumined
and
exalted
by
the
heavenly
glad
tidings
god
has
ever
dealt
with
man
in
mercy
and
kindness
he
who
conferred
the
divine
spirit
in
former
times
is
abundantly
able
and
capable
at
all
times
and
periods
to
grant
the
same
bestowals
therefore
let
us
be
hopeful
the
god
who
gave
to
the
world
formerly
will
do
so
now
and
in
the
future
god
who
breathed
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
upon
his
servants
will
breathe
it
upon
them
now
and
hereafter
there
is
no
cessation
to
his
bounty
the
divine
spirit
is
penetrating
from
eternity
to
eternity
for
it
is
the
bounty
of
god
and
the
bounty
of
god
is
eternal
can
you
conceive
of
limitation
of
the
divine
power
in
atomic
verities
or
cessation
of
the
divine
bounty
in
existing
organisms
could
you
conceive
the
power
now
manifest
in
this
glass
in
cohesion
of
its
atoms
becoming
nonexistent
the
energy
by
which
the
water
of
the
sea
is
constituted
failing
to
exert
itself
and
the
sea
disappearing
a
shower
of
rain
today
and
no
more
showers
afterward
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
terminated
and
no
more
light
or
heat
when
we
observe
that
in
the
kingdom
of
minerals
the
divine
bounties
are
continuous
how
much
more
shall
we
expect
and
realize
in
the
divine
spiritual
kingdom
how
much
greater
the
radiation
of
the
lights
of
god
and
the
bounty
of
everlasting
life
upon
the
soul
of
man
as
the
body
of
the
universe
is
continuous
indestructible
the
bounties
and
bestowals
of
the
divine
spirit
are
everlasting
i
praise
god
that
i
am
privileged
to
be
present
in
this
revered
assembly
which
is
quickened
with
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
heavenly
attractionits
members
investigating
reality
their
utmost
hope
the
establishment
of
international
peace
and
their
greatest
purpose
service
to
the
world
of
humanity
when
we
observe
the
world
of
created
phenomena
we
discover
that
each
atom
of
the
atoms
of
substance
is
moving
through
the
various
degrees
and
kingdoms
of
organic
life
for
instance
consider
the
ethereal
element
which
is
penetrating
and
traveling
through
all
the
contingent
realities
when
there
is
vibration
or
movement
in
the
ethereal
element
the
eye
is
affected
by
that
vibration
and
beholds
what
is
known
as
light
in
the
same
manner
the
bestowals
of
god
are
moving
and
circulating
throughout
all
created
things
this
illimitable
divine
bounty
has
no
beginning
and
will
have
no
ending
it
is
moving
circulating
and
becomes
effective
wherever
capacity
is
developed
to
receive
it
in
every
station
there
is
a
specialized
capacity
therefore
we
must
be
hopeful
that
through
the
bounty
and
favor
of
god
this
spirit
of
life
infusing
all
created
beings
shall
quicken
humanity
and
from
its
bestowals
the
human
world
shall
become
a
divine
world
this
earthly
kingdom
become
the
mirror
of
the
realm
of
divinity
the
virtues
and
perfections
of
the
world
of
humanity
become
unveiled
and
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
be
reflected
from
this
temple
i
am
most
grateful
to
the
president
of
this
society
and
express
my
most
respectful
greetings
to
him
it
is
my
hope
that
all
of
you
may
be
assisted
in
attaining
the
good
pleasure
of
god
the
spiritual
susceptibility
of
those
present
has
made
me
very
happy
and
i
beg
of
god
assistance
and
confirmation
for
all

the
material
world
is
subject
to
change
and
transformation
the
cause
of
the
kingdom
is
eternal
therefore
it
is
the
most
important
but
alas
day
by
day
the
power
of
the
kingdom
in
human
hearts
is
weakened
and
material
forces
gain
the
ascendancy
the
divine
signs
are
becoming
less
and
less
and
human
evidences
grow
stronger
they
have
reached
such
a
degree
that
materialists
are
advancing
and
aggressive
while
divine
forces
are
waning
and
vanishing
irreligion
has
conquered
religion
the
cause
of
the
chaotic
condition
lies
in
the
differences
among
the
religions
and
finds
its
origin
in
the
animosity
and
hatred
existing
between
sects
and
denominations
the
materialists
have
availed
themselves
of
this
dissension
amongst
the
religions
and
are
constantly
attacking
them
intending
to
uproot
the
tree
of
divine
planting
owing
to
strife
and
contention
among
themselves
the
religions
are
being
weakened
and
vanquished
if
a
commander
is
at
variance
with
his
army
in
the
execution
of
military
tactics
there
is
no
doubt
he
will
be
defeated
by
the
enemy
today
the
religions
are
at
variance
enmity
strife
and
recrimination
prevail
among
them
they
refuse
to
associate
nay
rather
if
necessary
they
shed
each
others
blood
read
history
and
record
to
see
what
dreadful
events
have
happened
in
the
name
of
religion
for

the
hebrew
prophets
were
sent
to
announce
christ
but
unfortunately
the
talmud
and
its
superstitions
veiled
him
so
completely
that
they
crucified
their
promised
messiah
had
they
renounced
the
talmudic
traditions
and
investigated
the
reality
of
the
religion
of
moses
they
would
have
become
believers
in
christ
blind
adherence
to
forms
and
imitations
of
ancestral
beliefs
deprived
them
of
their
messianic
bounty
they
were
not
refreshed
by
the
downpouring
rain
of
mercy
nor
were
they
illumined
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
truth
imitation
destroys
the
foundation
of
religion
extinguishes
the
spirituality
of
the
human
world
transforms
heavenly
illumination
into
darkness
and
deprives
man
of
the
knowledge
of
god
it
is
the
cause
of
the
victory
of
materialism
and
infidelity
over
religion
it
is
the
denial
of
divinity
and
the
law
of
revelation
it
refuses
prophethood
and
rejects
the
kingdom
of
god
when
materialists
subject
imitations
to
the
intellectual
analysis
of
reason
they
find
them
to
be
mere
superstitions
therefore
they
deny
religion
for
instance
the
jews
have
ideas
as
to
the
purity
and
impurity
of
religion
but
when
you
subject
these
ideas
to
scientific
scrutiny
they
are
found
to
be
without
foundation
is
it
impossible
for
us
to
receive
the
infinite
bounties
of
god
is
it
impossible
to
attain
the
virtues
of
the
spiritual
world
because
we
are
not
living
in
the
time
of
moses
the
period
of
the
prophets
or
the
era
of
christ
those
were
spiritual
cycles
can
we
not
develop
spiritually
because
we
are
far
from
them
and
are
living
in
a
materialistic
age
the
god
of
moses
and
jesus
is
able
to
bestow
the
same
favors
nay
greater
favors
upon
his
people
in
this
day
for
example
in
past
ages
he
bestowed
reason
intelligence
and
understanding
upon
his
servants
can
we
say
he
is
not
able
to
confer
his
bounties
in
this
century
would
it
be
just
if
he
sent
moses
for
the
guidance
of
past
nations
and
entirely
neglected
those
living
now
could
it
be
possible
that
this
present
period
has
been
deprived
of
divine
bounties
while
past
ages
of
tyranny
and
barbarism
received
an
inexhaustible
portion
of
them
the
same
merciful
god
who
bestowed
his
favors
in
the
past
has
opened
the
doors
of
his
kingdom
to
us
the
rays
of
his
sun
are
shining
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
is
quickening
that
omniscient
god
still
assists
and
confirms
us
illumines
our
hearts
gladdens
our
souls
and
perfumes
our
nostrils
with
the
fragrances
of
holiness
divine
wisdom
and
providence
have
encircled
all
and
spread
the
heavenly
table
before
us
we
must
take
a
bountiful
share
of
this
generous
favor
the
work
of
the
shepherd
is
to
bring
together
the
scattered
sheep
if
he
disperses
the
united
flock
he
is
not
the
shepherd
as
the
prophets
fulfilled
their
mission
in
this
respect
they
are
the
true
shepherds
when
moses
appeared
the
israelitish
people
were
disorganized
enmity
and
discord
increased
their
disunion
with
divine
power
he
assembled
and
united
this
scattered
flock
placed
within
their
hearts
the
pearl
of
love
freed
them
from
captivity
and
led
them
out
of
egypt
into
the
holy
land
they
made
wonderful
progress
in
sciences
and
arts
bonds
of
social
and
national
strength
cemented
them
their
progress
in
human
virtues
was
so
rapid
and
wonderful
that
they
rose
to
the
zenith
of
the
solomonic
sovereignty
could
it
be
said
that
moses
was
not
a
real
shepherd
and
that
he
did
not
gather
these
scattered
people
together
christ
was
a
real
shepherd
at
the
time
of
his
manifestation
the
greeks
romans
assyrians
and
egyptians
were
like
so
many
scattered
flocks
christ
breathed
upon
them
the
spirit
of
unity
and
harmonized
them
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
prophets
of
god
have
come
to
unite
the
children
of
men
and
not
to
disperse
them
to
establish
the
law
of
love
and
not
enmity
consequently
we
must
lay
aside
all
prejudicewhether
it
be
religious
racial
political
or
patriotic
we
must
become
the
cause
of
the
unification
of
the
human
race
strive
for
universal
peace
seek
the
means
of
love
and
destroy
the
basis
of
disagreement
so
that
this
material
world
may
become
divine
the
world
of
matter
become
the
realm
of
the
kingdom
and
humanity
attain
to
the
world
of
perfection

new

notes
by
esther
foster
in
the
terminology
of
the
holy
books
the
church
has
been
called
the
house
of
the
covenant
for
the
reason
that
the
church
is
a
place
where
people
of
different
thoughts
and
divergent
tendencieswhere
all
races
and
nationsmay
come
together
in
a
covenant
of
permanent
fellowship
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
in
the
house
of
god
man
must
be
submissive
to
god
he
must
enter
into
a
covenant
with
his
lord
in
order
that
he
shall
obey
the
divine
commands
and
become
unified
with
his
fellowman
he
must
not
consider
divergence
of
races
nor
difference
of
nationalities
he
must
not
view
variation
in
denomination
and
creed
nor
should
he
take
into
account
the
differing
degrees
of
thoughts
nay
rather
he
should
look
upon
all
as
mankind
and
realize
that
all
must
become
united
and
agreed
he
must
recognize
all
as
one
family
one
race
one
native
land
he
must
see
all
as
the
servants
of
one
god
dwelling
beneath
the
shelter
of
his
mercy
the
purport
of
this
is
that
the
church
is
a
collective
center
temples
are
symbols
of
the
reality
and
divinity
of
godthe
collective
center
of
mankind
consider
how
within
a
temple
every
race
and
people
is
seen
and
representedall
in
the
presence
of
the
lord
covenanting
together
in
a
covenant
of
love
and
fellowship
all
offering
the
same
melody
prayer
and
supplication
to
god
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
church
is
a
collective
center
for
mankind
for
this
reason
there
have
been
churches
and
temples
in
all
the
divine
religions
but
the
real
collective
centers
are
the
manifestations
of
god
of
whom
the
church
or
temple
is
a
symbol
and
expression
that
is
to
say
the
manifestation
of
god
is
the
real
divine
temple
and
collective
center
of
which
the
outer
church
is
but
a
symbol
recall
the
statement
of
jesus
christ
in
the
gospel
addressing
peter
he
said
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
church
of
god
is
the
law
of
god
and
that
the
actual
edifice
is
but
one
symbol
thereof
for
the
law
of
god
is
a
collective
center
which
unites
various
peoples
native
lands
tongues
and
opinions
all
find
shelter
in
its
protection
and
become
attracted
by
it
for
example
moses
and
the
mosaic
law
were
the
unifying
center
for
the
scattered
sheep
of
israel
he
united
these
wandering
flocks
brought
them
under
control
of
divine
law
educated
and
unified
them
caused
them
to
agree
and
uplifted
them
to
a
superlative
degree
of
development
at
a
time
when
they
were
debased
they
became
glorified
ignorant
they
were
made
knowing
in
the
bonds
of
captivity
they
were
given
freedom
in
short
they
were
unified
day
by
day
they
advanced
until
they
attained
the
highest
degree
of
progress
witnessed
in
that
age
we
prove
therefore
that
the
manifestation
of
god
and
the
law
of
god
accomplish
unity
it
is
selfevident
that
humanity
is
at
variance
human
tastes
differ
thoughts
native
lands
races
and
tongues
are
many
the
need
of
a
collective
center
by
which
these
differences
may
be
counterbalanced
and
the
people
of
the
world
be
unified
is
obvious
consider
how
nothing
but
a
spiritual
power
can
bring
about
this
unification
for
material
conditions
and
mental
aspects
are
so
widely
different
that
agreement
and
unity
are
not
possible
through
outer
means
it
is
possible
however
for
all
to
become
unified
through
one
spirit
just
as
all
may
receive
light
from
one
sun
therefore
assisted
by
the
collective
and
divine
center
which
is
the
law
of
god
and
the
reality
of
his
manifestation
we
can
overcome
these
conditions
until
they
pass
away
entirely
and
the
races
advance
consider
the
time
of
christ
peoples
races
and
governments
were
many
religions
sects
and
denominations
were
various
but
when
christ
appeared
the
messianic
reality
proved
to
be
the
collective
center
which
unified
them
beneath
the
same
tabernacle
of
agreement
reflect
upon
this
could
jesus
christ
have
united
these
divergent
factors
or
brought
about
such
results
through
political
power
was
this
unity
and
agreement
possible
through
material
forces
it
is
evident
that
it
was
not
nay
rather
these
various
peoples
were
brought
together
through
a
divine
power
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
they
were
blended
and
quickened
by
the
infusion
of
a
new
life
the
spirituality
of
christ
overcame
their
difficulties
so
that
their
disagreements
passed
away
completely
in
this
way
these
divergent
peoples
were
unified
and
became
welded
in
a
bond
of
love
which
alone
can
unite
hearts
therefore
it
is
shown
that
the
divine
manifestations
the
holy
mouthpieces
of
god
are
the
collective
centers
of
god
these
heavenly
messengers
are
the
real
shepherds
of
humanity
for
whenever
they
appear
in
the
world
they
unite
the
scattered
sheep
the
collective
center
has
always
appeared
in
the
orient
abraham
moses
jesus
christ
muhammad
were
collective
centers
of
their
day
and
time
and
all
arose
in
the
east
today
bahaullah
is
the
collective
center
of
unity
for
all
mankind
and
the
splendor
of
his
light
has
likewise
dawned
from
the
east
he
founded
the
oneness
of
humanity
in
persia
he
established
harmony
and
agreement
among
the
various
peoples
of
religious
beliefs
denominations
sects
and
cults
by
freeing
them
from
the
fetters
of
past
imitations
and
superstitions
leading
them
to
the
very
foundation
of
the
divine
religions
from
this
foundation
shines
forth
the
radiance
of
spirituality
which
is
unity
the
love
of
god
the
knowledge
of
god
praiseworthy
morals
and
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
bahaullah
renewed
these
principles
just
as
the
coming
of
spring
refreshes
the
earth
and
confers
new
life
upon
all
phenomenal
beings
for
the
freshness
of
the
former
springtimes
had
waned
the
vivification
had
ceased
the
lifegiving
breezes
were
no
longer
wafting
their
fragrances
winter
and
the
season
of
darkness
had
come
bahaullah
came
to
renew
the
life
of
the
world
with
this
new
and
divine
springtime
which
has
pitched
its
tent
in
the
countries
of
the
orient
in
the
utmost
power
and
glory
it
has
refreshed
the
world
of
the
orient
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
the
world
of
the
occident
should
abandon
dogmas
of
the
past
turn
away
from
empty
imitations
and
superstitions
investigate
the
reality
of
the
divine
religions
holding
fast
to
the
example
of
jesus
christ
acting
in
accordance
with
the
teachings
of
god
and
becoming
unified
with
the
orient
an
eternal
happiness
and
felicity
would
be
attained
in
the
western
world
material
civilization
has
attained
the
highest
point
of
development
but
divine
civilization
was
founded
in
the
land
of
the
east
the
east
must
acquire
material
civilization
from
the
west
and
the
west
must
receive
spiritual
civilization
from
the
east
this
will
establish
a
mutual
bond
when
these
two
come
together
the
world
of
humanity
will
present
a
glorious
aspect
and
extraordinary
progress
will
be
achieved
this
is
clear
and
evident
no
proof
is
needed
the
degree
of
material
civilization
in
the
occident
cannot
be
denied
nor
can
anyone
fail
to
confirm
the
spiritual
civilization
of
the
orient
for
all
the
divine
foundations
of
human
uplift
have
appeared
in
the
east
this
likewise
is
clear
and
evident
therefore
you
must
assist
the
east
in
order
that
it
may
attain
material
progress
the
east
must
likewise
promulgate
the
principles
of
spiritual
civilization
in
the
western
world
by
this
commingling
and
union
the
human
race
will
attain
the
highest
degree
of
prosperity
and
development
material
civilization
alone
is
not
sufficient
and
will
not
prove
productive
the
physical
happiness
of
material
conditions
was
allotted
to
the
animal
consider
how
the
animal
has
attained
the
fullest
degree
of
physical
felicity
a
bird
perches
upon
the
loftiest
branch
and
builds
there
its
nest
with
consummate
beauty
and
skill
all
the
grains
and
seeds
of
the
meadows
are
its
wealth
and
food
all
the
fresh
water
of
mountain
springs
and
rivers
of
the
plain
are
for
its
enjoyment
truly
this
is
the
acme
of
material
happiness
to
which
even
a
human
creature
cannot
attain
this
is
the
honor
of
the
animal
kingdom
but
the
honor
of
the
human
kingdom
is
the
attainment
of
spiritual
happiness
in
the
human
world
the
acquisition
of
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
the
honor
allotted
to
man
is
the
acquisition
of
the
supreme
virtues
of
the
human
world
this
is
his
real
happiness
and
felicity
but
if
material
happiness
and
spiritual
felicity
be
conjoined
it
will
be
delight
upon
delight
as
the
arabs
say
we
pray
that
god
will
unite
the
east
and
the
west
in
order
that
these
two
civilizations
may
be
exchanged
and
mutually
enjoyed
i
am
sure
it
will
come
to
pass
for
this
is
the
radiant
century
this
is
an
age
for
the
outpouring
of
divine
mercy
upon
the
exigency
of
this
new
centurythe
unity
of
the
east
and
the
west
it
will
surely
be
accomplished
question
what
is
the
status
of
woman
in
the
orient
answer
the
status
of
woman
in
former
times
was
exceedingly
deplorable
for
it
was
the
belief
of
the
orient
that
it
was
best
for
woman
to
be
ignorant
it
was
considered
preferable
that
she
should
not
know
reading
or
writing
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
informed
of
events
in
the
world
woman
was
considered
to
be
created
for
rearing
children
and
attending
to
the
duties
of
the
household
if
she
pursued
educational
courses
it
was
deemed
contrary
to
chastity
hence
women
were
made
prisoners
of
the
household
the
houses
did
not
even
have
windows
opening
upon
the
outside
world
bahaullah
destroyed
these
ideas
and
proclaimed
the
equality
of
man
and
woman
he
made
woman
respected
by
commanding
that
all
women
be
educated
that
there
be
no
difference
in
the
education
of
the
two
sexes
and
that
man
and
woman
share
the
same
rights
in
the
estimation
of
god
there
is
no
distinction
of
sex
one
whose
thought
is
pure
whose
education
is
superior
whose
scientific
attainments
are
greater
whose
deeds
of
philanthropy
excel
be
that
one
man
or
woman
white
or
colored
is
entitled
to
full
rights
and
recognition
there
is
no
differentiation
whatsoever
therefore
the
status
of
women
in
the
east
has
undergone
change
at
present
they
attend
schools
and
colleges
pursue
the
ordinary
curriculum
and
day
by
day
are
becoming
indispensable
to
men
and
equal
to
them
this
is
the
present
condition
of
womankind
in
persia
question
what
relation
do
you
sustain
to
the
founder
of
your
belief
are
you
his
successor
in
the
same
manner
as
the
pope
of
rome
answer
i
am
the
servant
of
bahaullah
the
founder
and
in
this
i
glory
no
honor
do
i
consider
greater
than
this
and
it
is
my
hope
that
i
may
be
confirmed
in
servitude
to
bahaullah
this
is
my
station
question
is
it
not
a
fact
that
universal
peace
cannot
be
accomplished
until
there
is
political
democracy
in
all
the
countries
of
the
world
answer
it
is
very
evident
that
in
the
future
there
shall
be
no
centralization
in
the
countries
of
the
world
be
they
constitutional
in
government
republican
or
democratic
in
form
the
united
states
may
be
held
up
as
the
example
of
future
governmentthat
is
to
say
each
province
will
be
independent
in
itself
but
there
will
be
federal
union
protecting
the
interests
of
the
various
independent
states
it
may
not
be
a
republican
or
a
democratic
form
to
cast
aside
centralization
which
promotes
despotism
is
the
exigency
of
the
time
this
will
be
productive
of
international
peace
another
fact
of
equal
importance
in
bringing
about
international
peace
is
womans
suffrage
that
is
to
say
when
perfect
equality
shall
be
established
between
men
and
women
peace
may
be
realized
for
the
simple
reason
that
womankind
in
general
will
never
favor
warfare
women
will
not
be
willing
to
allow
those
whom
they
have
so
tenderly
cared
for
to
go
to
the
battlefield
when
they
shall
have
a
vote
they
will
oppose
any
cause
of
warfare
another
factor
which
will
bring
about
universal
peace
is
the
linking
together
of
the
orient
and
the
occident
question
what
is
your
belief
about
reincarnation
answer
the
subject
of
reincarnation
has
two
aspects
one
is
that
which
the
hindustani
people
believe
and
even
that
is
subdivided
into
two
reincarnation
and
metempsychosis
according
to
one
belief
the
soul
goes
and
then
returns
in
certain
reincarnations
therefore
they
say
that
a
sick
person
is
sick
because
of
actions
in
a
previous
incarnation
and
that
this
is
retribution
the
other
school
of
hinduism
believes
that
man
sometimes
appears
as
an
animala
donkey
for
instanceand
that
this
is
retribution
for
past
acts
i
am
referring
to
the
beliefs
in
that
country
the
beliefs
of
the
schools
there
is
a
reincarnation
of
the
prophetic
mission
jesus
christ
speaking
of
john
the
baptist
declared
he
was
elias
when
john
the
baptist
was
questioned
art
thou
elias
he
said
i
am
not
these
two
statements
are
apparently
contradictory
but
in
reality
they
do
not
contradict
the
light
is
one
light
the
light
which
illumined
this
lamp
last
night
is
illuminating
it
tonight
this
does
not
mean
that
the
identical
rays
of
light
have
reappeared
but
the
virtues
of
illumination
the
light
which
revealed
itself
through
the
glass
reveals
itself
again
so
that
we
can
say
the
light
of
this
evening
is
the
light
of
last
evening
relighted
this
is
as
regards
its
virtues
and
not
as
regards
its
former
identity
this
is
our
view
of
reincarnation
we
believe
in
that
which
jesus
christ
and
all
the
prophets
have
believed
for
example
the
bab
states
i
am
the
return
of
all
the
prophets
this
is
significant
of
the
oneness
of
the
prophetic
virtues
the
oneness
of
power
the
oneness
of
bestowal
the
oneness
of
radiation
the
oneness
of
expression
the
oneness
of
revelation
question
what
is
the
attitude
of
your
belief
toward
the
family
answer
according
to
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
the
family
being
a
human
unit
must
be
educated
according
to
the
rules
of
sanctity
all
the
virtues
must
be
taught
the
family
the
integrity
of
the
family
bond
must
be
constantly
considered
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
members
must
not
be
transgressed
the
rights
of
the
son
the
father
the
mothernone
of
them
must
be
transgressed
none
of
them
must
be
arbitrary
just
as
the
son
has
certain
obligations
to
his
father
the
father
likewise
has
certain
obligations
to
his
son
the
mother
the
sister
and
other
members
of
the
household
have
their
certain
prerogatives
all
these
rights
and
prerogatives
must
be
conserved
yet
the
unity
of
the
family
must
be
sustained
the
injury
of
one
shall
be
considered
the
injury
of
all
the
comfort
of
each
the
comfort
of
all
the
honor
of
one
the
honor
of
all
question
what
is
the
relation
of
the
bahai
teaching
to
the
ancient
zoroastrian
religion
answer
the
religions
of
god
have
the
same
foundation
but
the
dogmas
appearing
later
have
differed
each
of
the
divine
religions
has
two
aspects
the
first
is
essential
it
concerns
morality
and
development
of
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
this
aspect
is
common
to
all
it
is
fundamental
it
is
one
there
is
no
difference
no
variation
in
it
as
regards
the
inculcation
of
morality
and
the
development
of
human
virtues
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever
between
the
teachings
of
zoroaster
jesus
and
bahaullah
in
this
they
agree
they
are
one
the
second
aspect
of
the
divine
religions
is
nonessential
it
concerns
human
needs
and
undergoes
change
in
every
cycle
according
to
the
exigency
of
the
time
for
example
in
the
time
of
moses
divorce
was
conformable
to
the
needs
and
conditions
moses
therefore
established
it
but
in
the
time
of
christ
divorces
were
numerous
and
the
cause
of
corruption
as
they
were
not
suitable
for
the
time
he
made
divorce
unlawful
and
likewise
changed
other
laws
these
are
needs
and
conditions
which
have
to
do
with
the
conduct
of
society
therefore
they
undergo
change
according
to
the
exigency
of
the
time
moses
dwelt
in
the
desert
as
there
were
no
penitentiaries
no
means
of
restitution
in
the
desert
and
wilderness
the
laws
of
god
were
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
could
this
be
carried
out
now
if
a
man
destroys
another
mans
eye
are
you
willing
to
destroy
the
eye
of
the
offender
if
a
mans
teeth
are
broken
or
his
ear
cut
off
will
you
demand
a
corresponding
mutilation
of
his
assailant
this
would
not
be
conformable
to
conditions
of
humanity
at
the
present
time
if
a
man
steals
shall
his
hand
be
cut
off
this
punishment
was
just
and
right
in
the
law
of
moses
but
it
was
applicable
to
the
desert
where
there
were
no
prisons
and
reformatory
institutions
of
later
and
higher
forms
of
government
today
you
have
government
and
organization
a
police
system
a
judge
and
trial
by
jury
the
punishment
and
penalty
is
now
different
therefore
the
nonessentials
which
deal
with
details
of
community
are
changed
according
to
the
exigency
of
the
time
and
conditions
but
the
essential
foundation
of
the
teachings
of
moses
zoroaster
jesus
and
bahaullah
is
identical
is
one
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever
question
is
peace
a
greater
word
than
love
answer
no
love
is
greater
than
peace
for
peace
is
founded
upon
love
love
is
the
objective
point
of
peace
and
peace
is
an
outcome
of
love
until
love
is
attained
peace
cannot
be
but
there
is
a
socalled
peace
without
love
the
love
which
is
from
god
is
the
fundamental
this
love
is
the
object
of
all
human
attainment
the
radiance
of
heaven
the
light
of
man
question
will
you
state
the
tenets
of
your
faith
answer
first
investigate
reality
man
must
leave
imitation
and
seek
reality
the
contemporaneous
religious
beliefs
differ
because
of
their
allegiance
to
dogma
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
abandon
imitations
and
seek
their
fundamental
reality
second
the
oneness
of
humanity
all
human
creatures
are
the
servants
of
god
all
are
submerged
in
the
sea
of
his
mercy
the
creator
of
all
is
one
god
the
provider
the
giver
the
protector
of
all
is
one
god
he
is
kind
to
all
why
should
we
be
unkind
all
live
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
love
why
should
we
hate
each
other
there
are
certain
people
who
are
ignorant
they
must
be
educated
some
are
like
children
they
must
be
trained
and
educated
until
they
reach
maturity
others
are
sickly
intellectually
ill
spiritually
ill
they
must
be
treated
and
healed
but
all
are
the
servants
of
god
third
religion
must
be
conducive
to
love
of
all
the
cause
of
fellowship
unity
and
light
if
it
be
the
cause
of
enmity
bloodshed
and
hatred
its
nonbeing
is
better
than
its
being
its
nonexistence
better
than
its
existence
religion
and
science
conform
and
agree
if
a
question
of
religion
violates
reason
and
does
not
agree
with
science
it
is
imagination
and
not
worthy
of
credence
fourth
equality
between
men
and
women
in
all
degrees
they
are
equal
the
readjustment
of
the
economic
laws
for
the
livelihood
of
man
must
be
effected
in
order
that
all
humanity
may
live
in
the
greatest
happiness
according
to
their
respective
degrees
fifth
spiritual
brotherhood
all
mankind
must
attain
to
spiritual
fraternitythat
is
to
say
fraternity
in
the
holy
spiritfor
patriotic
racial
and
political
fraternity
are
of
no
avail
their
results
are
meager
but
divine
fraternity
spiritual
fraternity
is
the
cause
of
unity
and
amity
among
mankind
as
heretofore
material
civilization
has
been
extended
the
divine
civilization
must
now
be
promulgated
until
the
two
agree
real
happiness
among
mankind
will
be
unknown
by
mere
intellectual
development
and
power
of
reason
man
cannot
attain
to
his
fullest
degreethat
is
to
say
by
means
of
intellect
alone
he
cannot
accomplish
the
progress
effected
by
religion
for
the
philosophers
of
the
past
strove
in
vain
to
revivify
the
world
of
mankind
through
the
intellectual
faculty
the
most
of
which
they
were
capable
was
educating
themselves
and
a
limited
number
of
disciples
they
themselves
have
confessed
failure
therefore
the
world
of
humanity
must
be
confirmed
by
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
in
order
to
receive
universal
education
through
the
infusion
of
divine
power
all
nations
and
peoples
become
quickened
and
universal
happiness
is
possible
these
are
some
of
the
principles
of
the
bahais
question
will
women
or
men
aid
this
new
religion
most
which
will
be
more
capable
answer
in
persia
the
men
have
aided
it
more
but
in
the
west
perchance
the
women
in
the
west
women
evidently
have
precedence
in
religion
but
in
the
east
men
surpass
the
women
question
what
will
be
the
food
of
the
united
people
answer
as
humanity
progresses
meat
will
be
used
less
and
less
for
the
teeth
of
man
are
not
carnivorous
for
example
the
lion
is
endowed
with
carnivorous
teeth
which
are
intended
for
meat
and
if
meat
be
not
found
the
lion
starves
the
lion
cannot
graze
its
teeth
are
of
different
shape
the
digestive
system
of
the
lion
is
such
that
it
cannot
receive
nourishment
save
through
meat
the
eagle
has
a
crooked
beak
the
lower
part
shorter
than
the
upper
it
cannot
pick
up
grain
it
cannot
graze
therefore
it
is
compelled
to
partake
of
meat
the
domestic
animals
have
herbivorous
teeth
formed
to
cut
grass
which
is
their
fodder
the
human
teeth
the
molars
are
formed
to
grind
grain
the
front
teeth
the
incisors
are
for
fruits
etc
it
is
therefore
quite
apparent
according
to
the
implements
for
eating
that
mans
food
is
intended
to
be
grain
and
not
meat
when
mankind
is
more
fully
developed
the
eating
of
meat
will
gradually
cease

notes
by
john
g
grundy
the
body
politic
today
is
greatly
in
need
of
a
physician
it
is
similar
to
a
human
body
afflicted
with
severe
ailments
a
doctor
diagnoses
the
case
and
prescribes
treatment
he
does
not
prescribe
however
until
he
has
made
the
diagnosis
the
disease
which
afflicts
the
body
politic
is
lack
of
love
and
absence
of
altruism
in
the
hearts
of
men
no
real
love
is
found
and
the
condition
is
such
that
unless
their
susceptibilities
are
quickened
by
some
power
so
that
unity
love
and
accord
may
develop
within
them
there
can
be
no
healing
no
agreement
among
mankind
love
and
unity
are
the
needs
of
the
body
politic
today
without
these
there
can
be
no
progress
or
prosperity
attained
therefore
the
friends
of
god
must
adhere
to
the
power
which
will
create
this
love
and
unity
in
the
hearts
of
the
sons
of
men
science
cannot
cure
the
illness
of
the
body
politic
science
cannot
create
amity
and
fellowship
in
human
hearts
neither
can
patriotism
nor
racial
allegiance
effect
a
remedy
it
must
be
accomplished
solely
through
the
divine
bounties
and
spiritual
bestowals
which
have
descended
from
god
in
this
day
for
that
purpose
this
is
an
exigency
of
the
times
and
the
divine
remedy
has
been
provided
the
spiritual
teachings
of
the
religion
of
god
can
alone
create
this
love
unity
and
accord
in
human
hearts
therefore
hold
to
these
heavenly
agencies
which
god
has
provided
so
that
through
the
love
of
god
this
soulbond
may
be
established
this
heartattachment
realized
and
the
light
of
the
reality
of
unity
be
reflected
from
you
throughout
the
universe
if
we
do
not
hold
fast
to
these
divine
agencies
and
means
no
result
will
be
possible
let
us
pray
to
god
that
he
will
exhilarate
our
spirits
so
we
may
behold
the
descent
of
his
bounties
illumine
our
eyes
to
witness
his
great
guidance
and
attune
our
ears
to
enjoy
the
celestial
melodies
of
the
heavenly
word
this
is
our
greatest
hope
this
is
our
ultimate

notes
by
edna
mckinney
i
have
come
from
distant
countries
of
the
orient
where
the
lights
of
heaven
have
ever
shone
forth
from
regions
where
the
manifestations
of
god
have
appeared
and
the
radiance
and
power
of
god
have
been
revealed
to
mankind
the
purpose
and
intention
of
my
visit
is
that
perchance
a
bond
of
unity
and
agreement
may
be
established
between
the
east
and
west
that
divine
love
may
encompass
all
nations
divine
radiance
enlighten
both
continents
and
the
bounties
of
the
holy
spirit
revivify
the
body
of
the
world
therefore
i
supplicate
the
threshold
of
god
that
the
orient
and
occident
may
become
as
one
that
the
various
peoples
and
religions
be
unified
and
souls
be
blended
as
the
waves
of
one
sea
may
they
become
as
trees
flowers
and
roses
which
adorn
and
beautify
the
same
garden
the
realm
of
divinity
is
an
indivisible
oneness
wholly
sanctified
above
human
comprehension
for
intellectual
knowledge
of
creation
is
finite
whereas
comprehension
of
divinity
is
infinite
how
can
the
finite
comprehend
the
infinite
we
are
utter
poverty
whereas
the
reality
of
divinity
is
absolute
wealth
how
can
utter
poverty
understand
absolute
wealth
we
are
utter
weakness
whereas
the
reality
of
divinity
is
absolute
power
utter
weakness
can
never
attain
nor
apprehend
absolute
power
the
phenomenal
beings
which
are
captives
of
limitations
are
ever
subject
to
transformation
and
change
in
condition
how
can
such
phenomenal
beings
ever
grasp
the
heavenly
eternal
unchanging
reality
assuredly
this
is
an
absolute
impossibility
for
when
we
study
the
creational
world
we
see
that
the
difference
of
degree
is
a
barrier
to
such
knowing
an
inferior
degree
can
never
comprehend
a
higher
degree
or
kingdom
the
mineral
no
matter
how
far
it
may
advance
can
never
attain
knowledge
of
the
vegetable
no
matter
how
the
plant
or
vegetable
may
progress
it
cannot
perceive
the
reality
of
the
animal
kingdomin
other
words
it
cannot
grasp
a
world
of
life
that
is
endowed
with
the
power
of
the
senses
the
animal
may
develop
a
wonderful
degree
of
intelligence
but
it
can
never
attain
the
powers
of
ideation
and
conscious
reflection
which
belong
to
man
it
is
evident
therefore
that
difference
in
degree
is
ever
an
obstacle
to
comprehension
of
the
higher
by
the
lower
the
superior
by
the
inferior
this
flower
so
beautiful
fresh
fragrant
and
delicately
scented
although
it
may
have
attained
perfection
in
its
own
kingdom
nevertheless
cannot
comprehend
the
human
reality
cannot
possess
sight
and
hearing
therefore
it
exists
unaware
of
the
world
of
man
although
man
and
itself
are
both
accidental
or
conditional
beings
the
difference
is
difference
of
degree
the
limitation
of
an
inferior
degree
is
the
barrier
to
comprehension
this
being
so
how
can
the
human
reality
which
is
limited
comprehend
the
eternal
unmanifest
creator
how
can
man
comprehend
the
omniscient
omnipresent
lord
undoubtedly
he
cannot
for
whatever
comes
within
the
grasp
of
human
mind
is
mans
limited
conception
whereas
the
divine
kingdom
is
unlimited
infinite
but
although
the
reality
of
divinity
is
sanctified
beyond
the
comprehension
of
its
creatures
it
has
bestowed
its
bounties
upon
all
kingdoms
of
the
phenomenal
world
and
evidences
of
spiritual
manifestation
are
witnessed
throughout
the
realms
of
contingent
existence
the
lights
of
god
illumine
the
world
of
man
even
as
the
effulgences
of
the
sun
shine
gloriously
upon
the
material
creation
the
sun
of
reality
is
one
its
bestowal
is
one
its
heat
is
one
its
rays
are
one
it
shines
upon
all
the
phenomenal
world
but
the
capacity
for
comprehending
it
differs
according
to
the
kingdoms
each
kingdom
receiving
the
light
and
bounty
of
the
eternal
sun
according
to
its
capacity
the
black
stone
receives
the
light
of
the
material
sun
the
trees
and
animals
likewise
are
recipients
of
it
all
exist
and
are
developed
by
that
one
bounty
the
perfect
soul
of
manthat
is
to
say
the
perfect
individualis
like
a
mirror
wherein
the
sun
of
reality
is
reflected
the
perfections
the
image
and
light
of
that
sun
have
been
revealed
in
the
mirror
its
heat
and
illumination
are
manifest
therein
for
that
pure
soul
is
a
perfect
expression
of
the
sun
these
mirrors
are
the
messengers
of
god
who
tell
the
story
of
divinity
just
as
the
material
mirror
reflects
the
light
and
disc
of
the
outer
sun
in
the
skies
in
this
way
the
image
and
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
appear
in
the
mirrors
of
the
manifestations
of
god
this
is
what
jesus
christ
meant
when
he
declared
the
father
is
in
the
son
the
purpose
being
that
the
reality
of
that
eternal
sun
had
become
reflected
in
its
glory
in
christ
himself
it
does
not
signify
that
the
sun
of
reality
had
descended
from
its
place
in
heaven
or
that
its
essential
being
had
effected
an
entrance
into
the
mirror
for
there
is
neither
entrance
nor
exit
for
the
reality
of
divinity
there
is
no
ingress
or
egress
it
is
sanctified
above
all
things
and
ever
occupies
its
own
holy
station
changes
and
transformations
are
not
applicable
to
that
eternal
reality
transformation
from
condition
to
condition
is
the
attribute
of
contingent
realities
at
a
time
when
warfare
and
strife
prevailed
among
nations
when
enmity
and
hatred
separated
sects
and
denominations
and
human
differences
were
very
great
bahaullah
appeared
upon
the
horizon
of
the
east
proclaiming
the
oneness
of
god
and
the
unity
of
the
world
of
humanity
he
promulgated
the
teaching
that
all
mankind
are
the
servants
of
one
god
that
all
have
come
into
being
through
the
bestowal
of
the
one
creator
that
god
is
kind
to
all
nurtures
rears
and
protects
all
provides
for
all
and
extends
his
love
and
mercy
to
all
races
and
people
inasmuch
as
god
is
loving
why
should
we
be
unjust
and
unkind
as
god
manifests
loyalty
and
mercy
why
should
we
show
forth
enmity
and
hatred
surely
the
divine
policy
is
more
perfect
than
human
plan
and
theory
for
no
matter
how
wise
and
sagacious
man
may
become
he
can
never
attain
a
policy
that
is
superior
to
the
policy
of
god
therefore
we
must
emulate
the
attitude
of
god
love
all
people
be
just
and
kind
to
every
human
creature
we
must
consider
all
as
the
leaves
branches
and
fruit
of
one
tree
children
of
one
household
for
all
are
the
progeny
of
adam
we
are
waves
of
one
sea
grass
of
the
same
meadow
stars
in
the
same
heaven
and
we
find
shelter
in
the
universal
divine
protector
if
one
be
sick
he
must
be
treated
the
ignorant
must
be
educated
the
sleeping
must
be
awakened
the
dead
must
be
quickened
with
life
these
were
principles
of
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
in
proclaiming
the
oneness
of
mankind
he
taught
that
men
and
women
are
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
and
that
there
is
no
distinction
to
be
made
between
them
the
only
difference
between
them
now
is
due
to
lack
of
education
and
training
if
woman
is
given
equal
opportunity
of
education
distinction
and
estimate
of
inferiority
will
disappear
the
world
of
humanity
has
two
wings
as
it
were
one
is
the
female
the
other
is
the
male
if
one
wing
be
defective
the
strong
perfect
wing
will
not
be
capable
of
flight
the
world
of
humanity
has
two
hands
if
one
be
imperfect
the
capable
hand
is
restricted
and
unable
to
perform
its
duties
god
is
the
creator
of
mankind
he
has
endowed
both
sexes
with
perfections
and
intelligence
given
them
physical
members
and
organs
of
sense
without
differentiation
or
distinction
as
to
superiority
therefore
why
should
woman
be
considered
inferior
this
is
not
according
to
the
plan
and
justice
of
god
he
has
created
them
equal
in
his
estimate
there
is
no
question
of
sex
the
one
whose
heart
is
purest
whose
deeds
are
most
perfect
is
acceptable
to
god
male
or
female
often
in
history
women
have
been
the
pride
of
humanityfor
example
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
she
was
the
glory
of
mankind
mary
magdalene
asiyih
daughter
of
pharaoh
sarah
wife
of
abraham
and
innumerable
others
have
glorified
the
human
race
by
their
excellences
in
this
day
there
are
women
among
the
bahais
who
far
outshine
men
they
are
wise
talented
wellinformed
progressive
most
intelligent
and
the
light
of
men
they
surpass
men
in
courage
when
they
speak
in
meetings
the
men
listen
with
great
respect
furthermore
the
education
of
women
is
of
greater
importance
than
the
education
of
men
for
they
are
the
mothers
of
the
race
and
mothers
rear
the
children
the
first
teachers
of
children
are
the
mothers
therefore
they
must
be
capably
trained
in
order
to
educate
both
sons
and
daughters
there
are
many
provisions
in
the
words
of
bahaullah
in
regard
to
this
he
promulgated
the
adoption
of
the
same
course
of
education
for
man
and
woman
daughters
and
sons
must
follow
the
same
curriculum
of
study
thereby
promoting
unity
of
the
sexes
when
all
mankind
shall
receive
the
same
opportunity
of
education
and
the
equality
of
men
and
women
be
realized
the
foundations
of
war
will
be
utterly
destroyed
without
equality
this
will
be
impossible
because
all
differences
and
distinction
are
conducive
to
discord
and
strife
equality
between
men
and
women
is
conducive
to
the
abolition
of
warfare
for
the
reason
that
women
will
never
be
willing
to
sanction
it
mothers
will
not
give
their
sons
as
sacrifices
upon
the
battlefield
after
twenty
years
of
anxiety
and
loving
devotion
in
rearing
them
from
infancy
no
matter
what
cause
they
are
called
upon
to
defend
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
women
obtain
equality
of
rights
war
will
entirely
cease
among
mankind
bahaullah
promulgated
the
fundamental
oneness
of
religion
he
taught
that
reality
is
one
and
not
multiple
that
it
underlies
all
divine
precepts
and
that
the
foundations
of
the
religions
are
therefore
the
same
certain
forms
and
imitations
have
gradually
arisen
as
these
vary
they
cause
differences
among
religionists
if
we
set
aside
these
imitations
and
seek
the
fundamental
reality
underlying
our
beliefs
we
reach
a
basis
of
agreement
because
it
is
one
and
not
multiple
among
other
principles
of
bahaullahs
teachings
was
the
harmony
of
science
and
religion
religion
must
stand
the
analysis
of
reason
it
must
agree
with
scientific
fact
and
proof
so
that
science
will
sanction
religion
and
religion
fortify
science
both
are
indissolubly
welded
and
joined
in
reality
if
statements
and
teachings
of
religion
are
found
to
be
unreasonable
and
contrary
to
science
they
are
outcomes
of
superstition
and
imagination
innumerable
doctrines
and
beliefs
of
this
character
have
arisen
in
the
past
ages
consider
the
superstitions
and
mythology
of
the
romans
greeks
and
egyptians
all
were
contrary
to
religion
and
science
it
is
now
evident
that
the
beliefs
of
these
nations
were
superstitions
but
in
those
times
they
held
to
them
most
tenaciously
for
example
one
of
the
many
egyptian
idols
was
to
those
people
an
authenticated
miracle
whereas
in
reality
it
was
a
piece
of
stone
as
science
could
not
sanction
the
miraculous
origin
and
nature
of
a
piece
of
rock
the
belief
in
it
must
have
been
superstition
it
is
now
evident
that
it
was
superstition
therefore
we
must
cast
aside
such
beliefs
and
investigate
reality
that
which
is
found
to
be
real
and
conformable
to
reason
must
be
accepted
and
whatever
science
and
reason
cannot
support
must
be
rejected
as
imitation
and
not
reality
then
differences
of
belief
will
disappear
all
will
become
as
one
family
one
people
and
the
same
susceptibility
to
the
divine
bounty
and
education
will
be
witnessed
among
mankind
o
thou
forgiving
lord
thou
art
the
shelter
of
all
these
thy
servants
thou
knowest
the
secrets
and
art
aware
of
all
things
we
are
all
helpless
and
thou
art
the
mighty
the
omnipotent
we
are
all
sinners
and
thou
art
the
forgiver
of
sins
the
merciful
the
compassionate
o
lord
look
not
at
our
shortcomings
deal
with
us
according
to
thy
grace
and
bounty
our
shortcomings
are
many
but
the
ocean
of
thy
forgiveness
is
boundless
our
weakness
is
grievous
but
the
evidences
of
thine
aid
and
assistance
are
clear
therefore
confirm
and
strengthen
us
enable
us
to
do
that
which
is
worthy
of
thy
holy
threshold
illumine
our
hearts
grant
us
discerning
eyes
and
attentive
ears
resuscitate
the

and

the

bestow
wealth
upon
the
poor
and
give
peace
and
security
to
the
fearful
accept
us
in
thy
kingdom
and
illumine
us
with
the
light
of
guidance
thou
art

mckinney
i
am
greatly
pleased
to
be
present
this
evening
truly
this
is
a
spiritual
gathering
i
perceive
the
fragrances
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
among
youdevotion
to
god
sincere
intention
and
spiritual
love
glad
tidings
from
the
time
of
the
creation
of
adam
to
this
day
there
have
been
two
pathways
in
the
world
of
humanity
one
the
natural
or
materialistic
the
other
the
religious
or
spiritual
the
pathway
of
nature
is
the
pathway
of
the
animal
realm
the
animal
acts
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
nature
follows
its
own
instincts
and
desires
whatever
its
impulses
and
proclivities
may
be
it
has
the
liberty
to
gratify
them
yet
it
is
a
captive
of
nature
it
cannot
deviate
in
the
least
degree
from
the
road
nature
has
established
it
is
utterly
lacking
spiritual
susceptibilities
ignorant
of
divine
religion
and
without
knowledge
of
the
kingdom
of
god
the
animal
possesses
no
power
of
ideation
or
conscious
intelligence
it
is
a
captive
of
the
senses
and
deprived
of
that
which
lies
beyond
them
it
is
subject
to
what
the
eye
sees
the
ear
hears
the
nostrils
sense
the
taste
detects
and
touch
reveals
these
sensations
are
acceptable
and
sufficient
for
the
animal
but
that
which
is
beyond
the
range
of
the
senses
that
realm
of
phenomena
through
which
the
conscious
pathway
to
the
kingdom
of
god
leads
the
world
of
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
divine
religionof
these
the
animal
is
completely
unaware
for
in
its
highest
station
it
is
a
captive
of
nature
one
of
the
strangest
things
witnessed
is
that
the
materialists
of
today
are
proud
of
their
natural
instincts
and
bondage
they
state
that
nothing
is
entitled
to
belief
and
acceptance
except
that
which
is
sensible
or
tangible
by
their
own
statements
they
are
captives
of
nature
unconscious
of
the
spiritual
world
uninformed
of
the
divine
kingdom
and
unaware
of
heavenly
bestowals
if
this
be
a
virtue
the
animal
has
attained
it
to
a
superlative
degree
for
the
animal
is
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
realm
of
spirit
and
out
of
touch
with
the
inner
world
of
conscious
realization
the
animal
would
agree
with
the
materialist
in
denying
the
existence
of
that
which
transcends
the
senses
if
we
admit
that
being
limited
to
the
plane
of
the
senses
is
a
virtue
the
animal
is
indeed
more
virtuous
than
man
for
it
is
entirely
bereft
of
that
which
lies
beyond
absolutely
oblivious
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
its
traces
whereas
god
has
deposited
within
the
human
creature
an
illimitable
power
by
which
he
can
rule
the
world
of
nature
consider
how
all
other
phenomenal
existence
and
beings
are
captives
of
nature
the
sun
that
colossal
center
of
our
solar
system
the
giant
stars
and
planets
the
towering
mountains
the
earth
itself
and
its
kingdoms
of
life
lower
than
the
humanall
are
captives
of
nature
except
man
no
other
created
thing
can
deviate
in
the
slightest
degree
from
obedience
to
natural
law
the
sun
in
its
glory
and
greatness
millions
of
miles
away
is
held
prisoner
in
its
orbit
of
universal
revolution
captive
of
universal
natural
control
man
is
the
ruler
of
nature
according
to
natural
law
and
limitation
he
should
remain
upon
the
earth
but
behold
how
he
violates
this
command
and
soars
above
the
mountains
in
airplanes
he
sails
in
ships
upon
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
dives
into
its
depths
in
submarines
man
makes
nature
his
servant
he
harnesses
the
mighty
energy
of
electricity
for
instance
and
imprisons
it
in
a
small
lamp
for
his
uses
and
convenience
he
speaks
from
the
east
to
the
west
through
a
wire
he
is
able
to
store
and
preserve
his
voice
in
a
phonograph
though
he
is
a
dweller
upon
earth
he
penetrates
the
mysteries
of
starry
worlds
inconceivably
distant
he
discovers
latent
realities
within
the
bosom
of
the
earth
uncovers
treasures
penetrates
secrets
and
mysteries
of
the
phenomenal
world
and
brings
to
light
that
which
according
to
natures
jealous
laws
should
remain
hidden
unknown
and
unfathomable
through
an
ideal
inner
power
man
brings
these
realities
forth
from
the
invisible
plane
to
the
visible
this
is
contrary
to
natures
law
it
is
evident
therefore
that
man
is
ruler
over
natures
sphere
and
province
nature
is
inert
man
is
progressive
nature
has
no
consciousness
man
is
endowed
with
it
nature
is
without
volition
and
acts
perforce
whereas
man
possesses
a
mighty
will
nature
is
incapable
of
discovering
mysteries
or
realities
whereas
man
is
especially
fitted
to
do
so
nature
is
not
in
touch
with
the
realm
of
god
man
is
attuned
to
its
evidences
nature
is
uninformed
of
god
man
is
conscious
of
him
man
acquires
divine
virtues
nature
is
denied
them
man
can
voluntarily
discontinue
vices
nature
has
no
power
to
modify
the
influence
of
its
instincts
altogether
it
is
evident
that
man
is
more
noble
and
superior
that
in
him
there
is
an
ideal
power
surpassing
nature
he
has
consciousness
volition
memory
intelligent
power
divine
attributes
and
virtues
of
which
nature
is
completely
deprived
and
bereft
therefore
man
is
higher
and
nobler
by
reason
of
the
ideal
and
heavenly
force
latent
and
manifest
in
him
how
strange
then
it
seems
that
man
notwithstanding
his
endowment
with
this
ideal
power
will
descend
to
a
level
beneath
him
and
declare
himself
no
greater
than
that
which
is
manifestly
inferior
to
his
real
station
god
has
created
such
a
conscious
spirit
within
him
that
he
is
the
most
wonderful
of
all
contingent
beings
in
ignoring
these
virtues
he
descends
to
the
material
plane
considers
matter
the
ruler
of
existence
and
denies
that
which
lies
beyond
is
this
virtue
in
its
fullest
sense
this
is
animalistic
for
the
animal
realizes
nothing
more
in
fact
from
this
standpoint
the
animal
is
the
greater
philosopher
because
it
is
completely
ignorant
of
the
kingdom
of
god
possesses
no
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
is
uninformed
of
the
heavenly
world
in
brief
this
is
a
view
of
the
pathway
of
nature
the
second
pathway
is
that
of
religion
the
road
of
the
divine
kingdom
it
involves
the
acquisition
of
praiseworthy
attributes
heavenly
illumination
and
righteous
actions
in
the
world
of
humanity
this
pathway
is
conducive
to
the
progress
and
uplift
of
the
world
it
is
the
source
of
human
enlightenment
training
and
ethical
improvementthe
magnet
which
attracts
the
love
of
god
because
of
the
knowledge
of
god
it
bestows
this
is
the
road
of
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
for
they
are
in
reality
the
foundation
of
the
divine
religion
of
oneness
there
is
no
change
or
transformation
in
this
pathway
it
is
the
cause
of
human
betterment
the
acquisition
of
heavenly
virtues
and
the
illumination
of
mankind
alas
that
humanity
is
completely
submerged
in
imitations
and
unrealities
notwithstanding
that
the
truth
of
divine
religion
has
ever
remained
the
same
superstitions
have
obscured
the
fundamental
reality
the
world
is
darkened
and
the
light
of
religion
is
not
apparent
this
darkness
is
conducive
to
differences
and
dissensions
rites
and
dogmas
are
many
and
various
therefore
discord
has
arisen
among
the
religious
systems
whereas
religion
is
for
the
unification
of
mankind
true
religion
is
the
source
of
love
and
agreement
amongst
men
the
cause
of
the
development
of
praiseworthy
qualities
but
the
people
are
holding
to
the
counterfeit
and
imitation
negligent
of
the
reality
which
unifies
so
they
are
bereft
and
deprived
of
the
radiance
of
religion
they
follow
superstitions
inherited
from
their
fathers
and
ancestors
to
such
an
extent
has
this
prevailed
that
they
have
taken
away
the
heavenly
light
of
divine
truth
and
sit
in
the
darkness
of
imitations
and
imaginations
that
which
was
meant
to
be
conducive
to
life
has
become
the
cause
of
death
that
which
should
have
been
an
evidence
of
knowledge
is
now
a
proof
of
ignorance
that
which
was
a
factor
in
the
sublimity
of
human
nature
has
proved
to
be
its
degradation
therefore
the
realm
of
the
religionist
has
gradually
narrowed
and
darkened
and
the
sphere
of
the
materialist
has
widened
and
advanced
for
the
religionist
has
held
to
imitation
and
counterfeit
neglecting
and
discarding
holiness
and
the
sacred
reality
of
religion
when
the
sun
sets
it
is
the
time
for
bats
to
fly
they
come
forth
because
they
are
creatures
of
the
night
when
the
lights
of
religion
become
darkened
the
materialists
appear
they
are
the
bats
of
night
the
decline
of
religion
is
their
time
of
activity
they
seek
the
shadows
when
the
world
is
darkened
and
clouds
have
spread
over
it
bahaullah
has
risen
from
the
eastern
horizon
like
the
glory
of
the
sun
he
has
come
into
the
world
he
has
reflected
the
reality
of
divine
religion
dispelled
the
darkness
of
imitations
laid
the
foundation
of
new
teachings
and
resuscitated
the
world
the
first
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
investigation
of
reality
man
must
seek
reality
himself
forsaking
imitations
and
adherence
to
mere
hereditary
forms
as
the
nations
of
the
world
are
following
imitations
in
lieu
of
truth
and
as
imitations
are
many
and
various
differences
of
belief
have
been
productive
of
strife
and
warfare
so
long
as
these
imitations
remain
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
is
impossible
therefore
we
must
investigate
reality
in
order
that
by
its
light
the
clouds
and
darkness
may
be
dispelled
reality
is
one
reality
it
does
not
admit
multiplicity
or
division
if
the
nations
of
the
world
investigate
reality
they
will
agree
and
become
united
many
people
and
sects
in
persia
have
sought
reality
through
the
guidance
and
teaching
of
bahaullah
they
have
become
united
and
now
live
in
a
state
of
agreement
and
love
among
them
there
is
no
longer
the
least
trace
of
enmity
and
strife
the
jews
were
expecting
the
appearance
of
the
messiah
looking
forward
to
it
with
devotion
of
heart
and
soul
but
because
they
were
submerged
in
imitations
they
did
not
believe
in
jesus
christ
when
he
appeared
finally
they
rose
against
him
even
to
the
extreme
of
persecution
and
shedding
his
blood
had
they
investigated
reality
they
would
have
accepted
their
promised
messiah
these
blind
imitations
and
hereditary
prejudices
have
invariably
become
the
cause
of
bitterness
and
hatred
and
have
filled
the
world
with
darkness
and
violence
of
war
therefore
we
must
seek
the
fundamental
truth
in
order
to
extricate
ourselves
from
such
conditions
and
then
with
illumined
faces
find
the
pathway
to
the
kingdom
of
god
the
second
teaching
of
bahaullah
concerns
the
unity
of
mankind
all
are
the
servants
of
god
and
members
of
one
human
family
god
has
created
all
and
all
are
his
children
he
rears
nourishes
provides
for
and
is
kind
to
all
why
should
we
be
unjust
and
unkind
this
is
the
policy
of
god
the
lights
of
which
have
shone
throughout
the
world
his
sun
bestows
its
effulgence
unsparingly
upon
all
his
clouds
send
down
rain
without
distinction
or
favor
his
breezes
refresh
the
whole
earth
it
is
evident
that
humankind
without
exception
is
sheltered
beneath
his
mercy
and
protection
some
are
imperfect
they
must
be
perfected
the
ignorant
must
be
taught
the
sick
healed
the
sleepers
awakened
the
child
must
not
be
oppressed
or
censured
because
it
is
undeveloped
it
must
be
patiently
trained
the
sick
must
not
be
neglected
because
they
are
ailing
nay
rather
we
must
have
compassion
upon
them
and
bring
them
healing
briefly
the
old
conditions
of
animosity
bigotry
and
hatred
between
the
religious
systems
must
be
dispelled
and
the
new
conditions
of
love
agreement
and
spiritual
brotherhood
be
established
among
them
the
third
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
that
religion
must
be
the
source
of
fellowship
the
cause
of
unity
and
the
nearness
of
god
to
man
if
it
rouses
hatred
and
strife
it
is
evident
that
absence
of
religion
is
preferable
and
an
irreligious
man
better
than
one
who
professes
it
according
to
the
divine
will
and
intention
religion
should
be
the
cause
of
love
and
agreement
a
bond
to
unify
all
mankind
for
it
is
a
message
of
peace
and
goodwill
to
man
from
god
the
fourth
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
agreement
of
religion
and
science
god
has
endowed
man
with
intelligence
and
reason
whereby
he
is
required
to
determine
the
verity
of
questions
and
propositions
if
religious
beliefs
and
opinions
are
found
contrary
to
the
standards
of
science
they
are
mere
superstitions
and
imaginations
for
the
antithesis
of
knowledge
is
ignorance
and
the
child
of
ignorance
is
superstition
unquestionably
there
must
be
agreement
between
true
religion
and
science
if
a
question
be
found
contrary
to
reason
faith
and
belief
in
it
are
impossible
and
there
is
no
outcome
but
wavering
and
vacillation
bahaullah
also
taught
that
prejudiceswhether
religious
racial
patriotic
or
politicalare
destructive
to
the
foundations
of
human
development
prejudices
of
any
kind
are
the
destroyers
of
human
happiness
and
welfare
until
they
are
dispelled
the
advancement
of
the
world
of
humanity
is
not
possible
yet
racial
religious
and
national
biases
are
observed
everywhere
for
thousands
of
years
the
world
of
humanity
has
been
agitated
and
disturbed
by
prejudices
as
long
as
it
prevails
warfare
animosity
and
hatred
will
continue
therefore
if
we
seek
to
establish
peace
we
must
cast
aside
this
obstacle
for
otherwise
agreement
and
composure
are
not
to
be
attained
sixth
bahaullah
set
forth
principles
of
guidance
and
teaching
for
economic
readjustment
regulations
were
revealed
by
him
which
ensure
the
welfare
of
the
commonwealth
as
the
rich
man
enjoys
his
life
surrounded
by
ease
and
luxuries
so
the
poor
man
must
likewise
have
a
home
and
be
provided
with
sustenance
and
comforts
commensurate
with
his
needs
this
readjustment
of
the
social
economy
is
of
the
greatest
importance
inasmuch
as
it
ensures
the
stability
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
until
it
is
effected
happiness
and
prosperity
are
impossible
seventh
bahaullah
taught
that
an
equal
standard
of
human
rights
must
be
recognized
and
adopted
in
the
estimation
of
god
all
men
are
equal
there
is
no
distinction
or
preferment
for
any
soul
in
the
dominion
of
his
justice
and
equity
eighth
education
is
essential
and
all
standards
of
training
and
teaching
throughout
the
world
of
mankind
should
be
brought
into
conformity
and
agreement
a
universal
curriculum
should
be
established
and
the
basis
of
ethics
be
the
same
ninth
a
universal
language
shall
be
adopted
and
be
taught
by
all
the
schools
and
institutions
of
the
world
a
committee
appointed
by
national
bodies
of
learning
shall
select
a
suitable
language
to
be
used
as
a
medium
of
international
communication
all
must
acquire
it
this
is
one
of
the
great
factors
in
the
unification
of
man
tenth
bahaullah
emphasized
and
established
the
equality
of
man
and
woman
sex
is
not
particularized
to
humanity
it
exists
throughout
the
animate
kingdoms
but
without
distinction
or
preference
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
there
is
complete
equality
between
male
and
female
of
species
likewise
in
the
animal
plane
equality
exists
all
are
under
the
protection
of
god
is
it
becoming
to
man
that
he
the
noblest
of
creatures
should
observe
and
insist
upon
such
distinction
womans
lack
of
progress
and
proficiency
has
been
due
to
her
need
of
equal
education
and
opportunity
had
she
been
allowed
this
equality
there
is
no
doubt
she
would
be
the
counterpart
of
man
in
ability
and
capacity
the
happiness
of
mankind
will
be
realized
when
women
and
men
coordinate
and
advance
equally
for
each
is
the
complement
and
helpmeet
of
the
other
the
world
of
humanity
cannot
advance
through
mere
physical
powers
and
intellectual
attainments
nay
rather
the
holy
spirit
is
essential
the
divine
father
must
assist
the
human
world
to
attain
maturity
the
body
of
man
is
in
need
of
physical
and
mental
energy
but
his
spirit
requires
the
life
and
fortification
of
the
holy
spirit
without
its
protection
and
quickening
the
human
world
would
be
extinguished
jesus
christ
declared
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
he
also
said
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
it
is
evident
therefore
according
to
christ
that
the
human
spirit
which
is
not
fortified
by
the
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
is
dead
and
in
need
of
resurrection
by
that
divine
power
otherwise
though
materially
advanced
to
high
degrees
man
cannot
attain
full
and
complete
progress

there

when

notes
by
howard
macnutt
we
have
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
philadelphia
spending
two
nights
there
and
speaking
in
two
large
churches
the
weather
proved
unpleasant
and
affected
my
health
the
purpose
in
these
movements
here
and
there
is
a
single
purposeit
is
to
spread
the
light
of
truth
in
this
dark
world
on
account
of
my
age
it
is
difficult
to
journey
sometimes
the
difficulties
are
arduous
but
out
of
love
for
the
friends
of
god
and
with
desire
to
sacrifice
myself
in
the
pathway
of
god
i
bear
them
in
gladness
the
purpose
is
the
result
which
is
accomplishedlove
and
unity
among
mankind
for
the
world
is
dark
with
discord
and
selfishness
hearts
are
negligent
souls
are
bereft
of
god
and
his
heavenly
bestowals
man
is
submerged
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
his
aims
objects
and
attainments
are
mortal
whereas
god
desires
for
him
immortal
accomplishments
in
his
heart
there
is
no
thought
of
god
he
has
sacrificed
his
portion
and
birthright
of
divine
spirituality
desire
and
passion
like
two
unmanageable
horses
have
wrested
the
reins
of
control
from
him
and
are
galloping
madly
in
the
wilderness
this
is
the
cause
of
the
degradation
of
the
world
of
humanity
this
is
the
cause
of
its
retrogression
into
the
appetites
and
passions
of
the
animal
kingdom
instead
of
divine
advancement
we
find
sensual
captivity
and
debasement
of
heavenly
virtues
of
the
soul
by
devotion
to
the
carnal
mortal
world
human
susceptibilities
sink
to
the
level
of
animalism
what
are
the
animals
propensities
to
eat
drink
wander
about
and
sleep
the
thoughts
the
minds
of
the
animals
are
confined
to
these
they
are
captives
in
the
bonds
of
these
desires
man
becomes
a
prisoner
and
slave
to
them
when
his
ultimate
desire
is
no
higher
than
his
welfare
in
this
world
of
the
senses
consider
how
difficult
for
man
is
the
attainment
of
pleasures
and
happiness
in
this
mortal
world
how
easy
it
is
for
the
animal
look
upon
the
fields
and
flowers
prairies
streams
forests
and
mountains
the
grazing
animals
the
birds
of
the
air
the
fishes
neither
toil
nor
undergo
hardships
they
sow
not
nor
are
they
concerned
about
the
reaping
they
have
no
anxiety
about
business
or
politicsno
trouble
or
worry
whatsoever
all
the
fields
and
grasses
all
the
meadows
of
fruits
and
grains
all
the
mountain
slopes
and
streams
of
salubrious
water
belong
to
them
they
do
not
labor
for
their
livelihood
and
happiness
because
everything
is
provided
and
made
possible
for
them
if
the
life
of
man
be
confined
to
this
physical
material
outlook
the
animals
life
is
a
hundred
times
better
easier
and
more
productive
of
comfort
and
contentment
the
animal
is
nobler
more
serene
and
confident
because
each
hour
is
free
from
anxiety
and
worriment
but
man
restless
and
dissatisfied
runs
from
morn
till
eve
sailing
the
seas
diving
beneath
them
in
submarines
flying
aloft
in
airplanes
delving
into
the
lowest
strata
of
the
earth
to
obtain
his
livelihoodall
with
the
greatest
difficulty
anxiety
and
unrest
therefore
in
this
respect
the
animal
is
nobler
more
serene
poised
and
confident
consider
the
birds
in
the
forest
and
jungle
how
they
build
their
nests
high
in
the
swaying
treetops
build
them
with
the
utmost
skill
and
beautyswinging
rocking
in
the
morning
breezes
drinking
the
pure
sweet
water
enjoying
the
most
enchanting
views
as
they
fly
here
and
there
high
overhead
singing
joyouslyall
without
labor
free
from
worry
care
and
forebodings
if
mans
life
be
confined
to
the
elemental
physical
world
of
enjoyment
one
lark
is
nobler
more
admirable
than
all
humanity
because
its
livelihood
is
prepared
its
condition
complete
its
accomplishment
perfect
and
natural
but
the
life
of
man
is
not
so
restricted
it
is
divine
eternal
not
mortal
and
sensual
for
him
a
spiritual
existence
and
livelihood
is
prepared
and
ordained
in
the
divine
creative
plan
his
life
is
intended
to
be
a
life
of
spiritual
enjoyment
to
which
the
animal
can
never
attain
this
enjoyment
depends
upon
the
acquisition
of
heavenly
virtues
the
sublimity
of
man
is
his
attainment
of
the
knowledge
of
god
the
bliss
of
man
is
the
acquiring
of
heavenly
bestowals
which
descend
upon
him
in
the
outflow
of
the
bounty
of
god
the
happiness
of
man
is
in
the
fragrance
of
the
love
of
god
this
is
the
highest
pinnacle
of
attainment
in
the
human
world
how
preferable
to
the
animal
and
its
hopeless
kingdom
therefore
consider
how
base
a
nature
it
reveals
in
man
that
notwithstanding
the
favors
showered
upon
him
by
god
he
should
lower
himself
into
the
animal
sphere
be
wholly
occupied
with
material
needs
attached
to
this
mortal
realm
imagining
that
the
greatest
happiness
is
to
attain
wealth
in
this
world
how
purposeless
how
debased
is
such
a
nature
god
has
created
man
in
order
that
he
may
be
a
dove
of
the
kingdom
a
heavenly
candle
a
recipient
of
eternal
life
god
has
created
man
in
order
that
he
may
be
resuscitated
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
become
the
light
of
the
world
how
debased
the
soul
which
can
find
enjoyment
in
this
darkness
occupied
with
itself
the
captive
of
self
and
passion
wallowing
in
the
mire
of
the
material
world
how
degraded
is
such
a
nature
what
an
ignorance
this
is
what
a
blindness
how
glorious
the
station
of
man
who
has
partaken
of
the
heavenly
food
and
built
the
temple
of
his
everlasting
residence
in
the
world
of
heaven
the
manifestations
of
god
have
come
into
the
world
to
free
man
from
these
bonds
and
chains
of
the
world
of
nature
although
they
walked
upon
the
earth
they
lived
in
heaven
they
were
not
concerned
about
material
sustenance
and
prosperity
of
this
world
their
bodies
were
subjected
to
inconceivable
distress
but
their
spirits
ever
soared
in
the
highest
realms
of
ecstasy
the
purpose
of
their
coming
their
teaching
and
suffering
was
the
freedom
of
man
from
himself
shall
we
therefore
follow
in
their
footsteps
escape
from
this
cage
of
the
body
or
continue
subject
to
its
tyranny
shall
we
pursue
the
phantom
of
a
mortal
happiness
which
does
not
exist
or
turn
toward
the
tree
of
life
and
the
joys
of
its
eternal
fruits
i
have
come
to
this
country
in
the
advanced
years
of
my
life
undergoing
difficulties
of
health
and
climate
because
of
excessive
love
for
the
friends
of
god
it
is
my
wish
that
they
may
be
assisted
to
become
servants
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
captives
in
the
service
of
the
will
of
god
this
captivity
is
freedom
this
sacrifice
is
glorification
this
labor
is
reward
this
need
is
bestowal
for
service
in
love
for
mankind
is
unity
with
god
he
who
serves
has
already
entered
the
kingdom
and
is
seated
at

above

and

consider
the
human
world
see
how
nations
have
come
and
gone
they
have
been
of
all
minds
and
purposes
some
were
mere
captives
of
self
and
desire
engulfed
in
the
passions
of
the
lower

they
attained
to
wealth
to
the

to

and
what
was
the
final
outcome
utter
evanescence
and
oblivion
reflect
upon

no

remains
no

no

souls
have
appeared
in

who
were
pure
and
undefiled
who
have
directed
their

toward
god
seeking
the
reward
of
god
attaining
nearness
to
the

acceptable
in
the
good
pleasure
of

they
have
been
the

of
guidance
and
stars
of
the
supreme
concourse
consider
these
souls
shining
like
stars
in
the
horizon
of
sanctity
forevermore
it
must
not
be
implied
that
one
should
give
up
avocation
and
attainment
to
livelihood
on
the
contrary
in
the
cause
of
bahaullah
monasticism
and
asceticism
are
not
sanctioned
in
this
great
cause
the
light
of
guidance
is
shining
and
radiant
bahaullah
has
even
said
that
occupation
and
labor
are
devotion
all
humanity
must
obtain
a
livelihood
by
sweat
of
the
brow
and
bodily
exertion
at
the
same
time
seeking
to
lift
the
burden
of
others
striving
to
be
the
source
of
comfort
to
souls
and
facilitating
the
means
of
living
this
in
itself
is
devotion
to
god
bahaullah
has
thereby
encouraged
action
and
stimulated
service
but
the
energies
of
the
heart
must
not
be
attached
to
these
things
the
soul
must
not
be
completely
occupied
with
them
though
the
mind
is
busy
the
heart
must
be
attracted
toward
the
kingdom
of
god
in
order
that
the
virtues
of
humanity
may
be
attained
from
every
direction
and
source
we
have
forsaken
the
path
of
god
we
have
given
up
attention
to
the
divine
kingdom
we
have
not
severed
the
heart
from
worldly
attractions
we
have
become
defiled
with
qualities
which
are
not
praiseworthy
in
the
sight
of
god
we
are
so
completely
steeped
in
material
issues
and
tendencies
that
we
are
not
partakers
of
the
virtues
of
humanity
little
reflection
little
admonition
is
necessary
for
us
to
realize
the
purpose
of
our
creation
what
a
heavenly
potentiality
god
has
deposited
within
us
what
a
power
god
has
given
our
spirits
he
has
endowed
us
with
a
power
to
penetrate
the
realities
of
things
but
we
must
be
selfabnegating
we
must
have
pure
spirits
pure
intentions
and
strive
with
heart
and
soul
while
in
the
human
world
to
attain
everlasting
glory
i
have
come
for
the
purpose
of
admonition
and
voicing
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
it
is
my
hope
that
his
will
and
guidance
may
influence
your
spirits
souls
and
hearts
causing
them
to
become
pure
holy
sanctified
and
illumined
and
making
you
lamps
of
heavenly
illumination
to
the
world
this
is
my
desire
this
is
my

macnutt
you
are
all
exceedingly
welcome
do
you
realize
how
much
you
should
thank
god
for
his
blessings
if
you
should
thank
him
a
thousand
times
with
each
breath
it
would
not
be
sufficient
because
god
has
created
and
trained
you
he
has
protected
you
from
every
affliction
and
prepared
every
gift
and
bestowal
consider
what
a
kind
father
he
is
he
bestows
his
gift
before
you
ask
we
were
not
in
the
world
of
existence
but
as
soon
as
we
were
born
we
found
everything
prepared
for
our
needs
and
comfort
without
question
on
our
part
he
has
given
us
a
kind
father
and
compassionate
mother
provided
for
us
two
springs
of
salubrious
milk
pure
atmosphere
refreshing
water
gentle
breezes
and
the
sun
shining
above
our
heads
in
brief
he
has
supplied
all
the
necessities
of
life
although
we
did
not
ask
for
any
of
these
great
gifts
with
pure
mercy
and
bounty
he
has
prepared
this
great
table
it
is
a
mercy
which
precedes
asking
there
is
another
kind
of
mercy
which
is
realized
after
questioning
and
supplication
he
has
bestowed
both
upon
uswithout
asking
and
with
supplication
he
has
created
us
in
this
radiant
century
a
century
longed
for
and
expected
by
all
the
sanctified
souls
in
past
periods
it
is
a
blessed
century
it
is
a
blessed
day
the
philosophers
of
history
have
agreed
that
this
century
is
equal
to
one
hundred
past
centuries
this
is
true
from
every
standpoint
this
is
the
century
of
science
inventions
discoveries
and
universal
laws
this
is
the
century
of
the
revelation
of
the
mysteries
of
god
this
is
the
century
of
the
effulgence
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
truth
therefore
you
must
render
thanks
and
glorification
to
god
that
you
were
born
in
this
age
furthermore
you
have
listened
to
the
call
of
bahaullah
your
nostrils
are
perfumed
with
the
breezes
of
the
paradise
of
abha
you
have
caught
glimpses
of
the
light
from
the
horizon
of
the
orient
you
were
asleep
you
are
awakened
your
ears
are
attentive
your
hearts
are
informed
you
have
acquired
the
love
of
god
you
have
attained
to
the
knowledge
of
god
this
is
the
most
great
bestowal
of
god
this
is
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
and
this
consists
of
faith
and
assurance
this
eternal
life
is
the
second

this
is
the
baptism
of
the
holy
spirit
god
has
destined
this
station
for
you
all
he
has
prepared
this
for
you
you
must
appreciate
the
value
of
this
bounty
and
engage
your
time
in
mentioning
and
thanking
the
true
one
you
must
live
in
the
utmost
happiness
if
any
trouble
or
vicissitude
comes
into
your
lives
if
your
heart
is
depressed
on
account
of
health
livelihood
or
vocation
let

notes
by

macnutt
i
have
made
you
wait
awhile
but
as
i
was
tired
i
slept
while
i
was
sleeping
i
was
conversing
with
you
as
though
speaking
at
the
top
of
my
voice
then
through
the
effect
of
my
own
voice
i
awoke
as
i
awoke
one
word
was
upon
my
lipsthe
word
imtiyaz
distinction
so
i
will
speak
to
you
upon
that
subject
this
morning
when
we
look
upon
the
world
of
existence
we
realize
that
all
material
things
have
a
common
bond
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
there
are
certain
points
of
distinction
between
them
for
instance
all
earthly
objects
have
common
bodily
ties
the
minerals
vegetables
and
animals
have
elemental
bodies
in
common
with
each
other
likewise
they
have
place
in
the
order
of
creation
this
is
the
common
tie
or
point
of
contact
between
them
all
of
them
pass
through
the
process
of
composition
and
decomposition
this
is
a
natural
law
to
which
all
are
subject
this
law
is
ruling
throughout
creation
and
constitutes
a
bond
of
connection
among
created
things
but
at
the
same
time
there
are
certain
distinguishing
features
between
these
objects
for
instance
between
the
mineral
and
vegetable
the
vegetable
and
animal
the
animal
and
human
points
of
distinction
exist
which
are
unmistakable
and
significant
likewise
there
are
distinctions
between
kinds
and
species
of
each
kingdom
when
we
consider
the
mineral
kingdom
in
detail
we
observe
not
only
points
of
similarity
between
objects
but
points
of
distinction
as
well
some
are
immovable
bodies
some
hard
and
solid
some
have
the
power
of
expansion
and
contraction
some
are
liquid
some
gaseous
some
have
weight
others
like
fire
and
electricity
have
not
so
there
are
many
points
of
distinction
among
these
kinds
of
elements
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
also
we
observe
distinction
between
the
various
sorts
and
species
of
organisms
each
has
its
own
form
color
and
fragrance
in
the
animal
kingdom
the
same
law
rules
as
many
distinctions
in
form
color
and
function
are
noticeable
it
is
the
same
in
the
human
kingdom
from
the
standpoint
of
color
there
are
white
black
yellow
and
red
people
from
the
standpoint
of
physiognomy
there
is
a
wide
difference
and
distinction
among
races
the
asian
african
and
american
have
different
physiognomies
the
men
of
the
north
and
men
of
the
south
are
very
different
in
type
and
features
from
an
economic
standpoint
in
the
law
of
living
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
some
are
poor
others
wealthy
some
are
wise
others
ignorant
some
are
patient
and
serene
some
impatient
and
excitable
some
are
prone
to
justice
others
practice
injustice
and
oppression
some
are
meek
others
arrogant
in
brief
there
are
many
points
of
distinction
among
humankind
i
desire
distinction
for
you
the
bahais
must
be
distinguished
from
others
of
humanity
but
this
distinction
must
not
depend
upon
wealththat
they
should
become
more
affluent
than
other
people
i
do
not
desire
for
you
financial
distinction
it
is
not
an
ordinary
distinction
i
desire
not
scientific
commercial
industrial
distinction
for
you
i
desire
spiritual
distinctionthat
is
you
must
become
eminent
and
distinguished
in
morals
in
the
love
of
god
you
must
become
distinguished
from
all
else
you
must
become
distinguished
for
loving
humanity
for
unity
and
accord
for
love
and
justice
in
brief
you
must
become
distinguished
in
all
the
virtues
of
the
human
worldfor
faithfulness
and
sincerity
for
justice
and
fidelity
for
firmness
and
steadfastness
for
philanthropic
deeds
and
service
to
the
human
world
for
love
toward
every
human
being
for
unity
and
accord
with
all
people
for
removing
prejudices
and
promoting
international
peace
finally
you
must
become
distinguished
for
heavenly
illumination
and
for
acquiring
the
bestowals
of
god
i
desire
this
distinction
for
you
this
must
be
the
point
of
distinction
among
you
june
talk
at
fourth
unitarian
church
beverly
road
flatbush
brooklyn
new
york
notes
by
esther
foster
this
is
a
unitarian
church
and
in
the
arabic
tongue
this
day
may
well
be
called
yawmalittihad
the
unitarian
day
therefore
i
consider
it
appropriate
to
speak
to
you
upon
the
subject
of
unity
what
is
real
unity
when
we
observe
the
human
world
we
find
various
collective
expressions
of
unity
therein
for
instance
man
is
distinguished
from
the
animal
by
his
degree
or
kingdom
this
comprehensive
distinction
includes
all
the
posterity
of
adam
and
constitutes
one
great
household
or
human
family
which
may
be
considered
the
fundamental
or
physical
unity
of
mankind
furthermore
a
distinction
exists
between
various
groups
of
humankind
according
to
lineage
each
group
forming
a
racial
unity
separate
from
the
others
there
is
also
the
unity
of
tongue
among
those
who
use
the
same
language
as
a
means
of
communication
national
unity
where
various
peoples
live
under
one
form
of
government
such
as
french
german
british
etc
and
political
unity
which
conserves
the
civil
rights
of
parties
or
factions
of
the
same
government
all
these
unities
are
imaginary
and
without
real
foundation
for
no
real
result
proceeds
from
them
the
purpose
of
true
unity
is
real
and
divine
outcomes
from
these
limited
unities
mentioned
only
limited
outcomes
proceed
whereas
unlimited
unity
produces
unlimited
result
for
instance
from
the
limited
unity
of
race
or
nationality
the
results
at
most
are
limited
it
is
like
a
family
living
alone
and
solitary
there
are
no
unlimited
or
universal
outcomes
from
it
the
unity
which
is
productive
of
unlimited
results
is
first
a
unity
of
mankind
which
recognizes
that
all
are
sheltered
beneath
the
overshadowing
glory
of
the
allglorious
that
all
are
servants
of
one
god
for
all
breathe
the
same
atmosphere
live
upon
the
same
earth
move
beneath
the
same
heavens
receive
effulgence
from
the
same
sun
and
are
under
the
protection
of
one
god
this
is
the
most
great
unity
and
its
results
are
lasting
if
humanity
adheres
to
it
but
mankind
has
hitherto
violated
it
adhering
to
sectarian
or
other
limited
unities
such
as
racial
patriotic
or
unity
of
selfinterests
therefore
no
great
results
have
been
forthcoming
nevertheless
it
is
certain
that
the
radiance
and
favors
of
god
are
encompassing
minds
have
developed
perceptions
have
become
acute
sciences
and
arts
are
widespread
and
capacity
exists
for
the
proclamation
and
promulgation
of
the
real
and
ultimate
unity
of
mankind
which
will
bring
forth
marvelous
results
it
will
reconcile
all
religions
make
warring
nations
loving
cause
hostile
kings
to
become
friendly
and
bring
peace
and
happiness
to
the
human
world
it
will
cement
together
the
orient
and
occident
remove
forever
the
foundations
of
war
and
upraise
the
ensign
of
the
most
great
peace
these
limited
unities
are
therefore
signs
of
that
great
unity
which
will
make
all
the
human
family
one
by
being
productive
of
the
attractions
of
conscience
in
mankind
another
unity
is
the
spiritual
unity
which
emanates
from
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
this
is
greater
than
the
unity
of
mankind
human
unity
or
solidarity
may
be
likened
to
the
body
whereas
unity
from
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
is
the
spirit
animating
the
body
this
is
a
perfect
unity
it
creates
such
a
condition
in
mankind
that
each
one
will
make
sacrifices
for
the
other
and
the
utmost
desire
will
be
to
forfeit
life
and
all
that
pertains
to
it
in
behalf
of
anothers
good
this
is
the
unity
which
existed
among
the
disciples
of
jesus
christ
and
bound
together
the
prophets
and
holy
souls
of
the
past
it
is
the
unity
which
through
the
influence
of
the
divine
spirit
is
permeating
the
bahais
so
that
each
offers
his
life
for
the
other
and
strives
with
all
sincerity
to
attain
his
good
pleasure
this
is
the
unity
which
caused
twenty
thousand
people
in
persia
to
give
their
lives
in
love
and
devotion
to
it
it
made
the
bab
the
target
of
a
thousand
arrows
and
caused
bahaullah
to
suffer
exile
and
imprisonment
forty
years
this
unity
is
the
very
spirit
of
the
body
of
the
world
it
is
impossible
for
the
body
of
the
world
to
become
quickened
with
life
without
its
vivification

christmay
my
life
be
a

this
unity
among
mankind
every
soul
who
believed
in

christ
became
revivified
and
resuscitated
through
this
spirit

to

of
the
manifestations
of

abraham
moses

christ
muhammad
the
bab
and
bahaullah
this
is
a
unity
divine
heavenly
radiant
mercifulthe
one
reality
appearing
in
its
successive
manifestations
for
instance
the
sun
is
one
and
the
same
but
its
points
of
dawning
are
various
during
the
summer
season
it
rises
from
the
northern
point
of
the
ecliptic
in
winter
it
appears
from
the
southern
point
of
rising
each
month
between
it
appears
from
a
certain
zodiacal
position
although
these
dawning
points
are
different
the
sun
is
the
same
sun
which
has
appeared
from
them
all
the
significance
is
the
reality
of
prophethood
which
is
symbolized
by
the
sun
and
the
holy
manifestations
are
the
dawning
places
or
zodiacal
points
there
is
also
the
divine
unity
or
entity
which
is
sanctified
above
all
concept
of
humanity
it
cannot
be
comprehended
nor
conceived
because
it
is
infinite
reality
and
cannot
become
finite
human
minds
are
incapable
of
surrounding
that
reality
because
all
thoughts
and
conceptions
of
it
are
finite
intellectual
creations
and
not
the
reality
of
divine
being
which
alone
knows
itself
for
example
if
we
form
a
conception
of
divinity
as
a
living
almighty
selfsubsisting
eternal
being
this
is
only
a
concept
apprehended
by
a
human
intellectual
reality
it
would
not
be
the
outward
visible
reality
which
is
beyond
the
power
of
human
mind
to
conceive
or
encompass
we
ourselves
have
an
external
visible
entity
but
even
our
concept
of
it
is
the
product
of
our
own
brain
and
limited
comprehension
the
reality
of
divinity
is
sanctified
above
this
degree
of
knowing
and
realization
it
has
ever
been
hidden
and
secluded
in
its
own
holiness
and
sanctity
above
our
comprehending
although
it
transcends
our
realization
its
lights
bestowals
traces
and
virtues
have
become
manifest
in
the
realities
of
the
prophets
even
as
the
sun
becomes
resplendent
in
various
mirrors
these
holy
realities
are
as
reflectors
and
the
reality
of
divinity
is
as
the
sun
which
although
it
is
reflected
from
the
mirrors
and
its
virtues
and
perfections
become
resplendent
therein
does
not
stoop
from
its
own
station
of
majesty
and
glory
and
seek
abode
in
the
mirrors
it
remains
in
its
heaven
of
sanctity
at
most
it
is
this
that
its
lights
become
manifest
and
evident
in
its
mirrors
or
manifestations
therefore
its
bounty
proceeding
from
them
is
one
bounty
but
the
recipients
of
that
bounty
are
many
this
is
the
unity
of

this

the

never

from

this
is

this
is

whereby
we
praise
and
adore

o
my

these
are

at
the

thy

they
receive

from
the

in
this
glorious

they
long
for
thy
goodwill
in
all
great

that
the

may
appear

notes
by
esther
foster
this
is
a
splendid
gathering
a
meeting
of
the
maidservants
of
the
merciful
and
the
beloved
of
god
whenever
such
gatherings
have
taken
place
in
this
world
the
results
have
been
very
great
they
have
exerted
an
influence
upon
the
world
of
hearts
and
minds
wherever
a
lamp
is
lighted
in
the
night
naturally
people
are
attracted
and
gather
around
it
when
you
see
such
an
assemblage
as
this
you
may
know
that
a
light
is
illumining
the
darkness
there
are
lamps
the
light
of
which
is
limited
there
are
lamps
the
light
of
which
is
unlimited
there
are
lamps
which
illumine
small
places
and
lamps
which
illumine
the
horizons
the
lamp
of
the
guidance
of
god
wherever
lighted
has
shed
its
radiance
throughout
the
east
and
the
west
praise
be
to
god
it
has
been
lighted
in
this
country
day
by
day
its
radiance
is
becoming
more
resplendent
and
its
effulgence
more
widespread
this
is
not
known
now
but
later
on
its
traces
will
become
evident
consider
the
days
of
christ
how
the
light
of
guidance
brightened
twelve
hearts
how
limited
it
seemed
but
how
expansive
it
became
afterward
and
illumined
the
world
you
are
not
a
large
body
of
people
but
because
the
lamp
of
guidance
has
been
lighted
in
your
hearts
the
effects
will
be
wonderful
in
the
years
to
come
it
is
evident
and
manifest
that
the
world
will
be
illumined
by
this
light
therefore
you
must
thank
god
thatpraise
be
to
godthrough
his
grace
and
favor
the
lamp
of
the
most
great
guidance
has
been
ignited
in
your
hearts
and
he
has
summoned
you
to
his
kingdom
he
has
caused
the
call
of
the
supreme
concourse
to
reach
your
ears
the
doors
of
heaven
have
been
opened
unto
you
the
sun
of
reality
is
shining
upon
you
the
cloud
of
mercy
is
pouring
down
and
the
breezes
of
providence
are
wafting
through
your
souls
although
the
bestowal
is
great
and
the
grace
is
glorious
yet
capacity
and
readiness
are
requisite
without
capacity
and
readiness
the
divine
bounty
will
not
become
manifest
and
evident
no
matter
how
much
the
cloud
may
rain
the
sun
may
shine
and
the
breezes
blow
the
soil
that
is
sterile
will
give
no
growth
the
ground
that
is
pure
and
free
from
thorns
and
thistles
receives
and
produces
through
the
rain
of
the
cloud
of
mercy
no
matter
how
much
the
sun
shines
it
will
have
no
effect
upon
the
black
rock
but
in
a
pure
and
polished
mirror
its
lights
become
resplendent
therefore
we
must
develop
capacity
in
order
that
the
signs
of
the
mercy
of
the
lord
may
be
revealed
in
us
we
must
endeavor
to
free
the
soil
of
the
hearts
from
useless
weeds
and
sanctify
it
from
the
thorns
of
worthless
thoughts
in
order
that
the
cloud
of
mercy
may
bestow
its
power
upon
us
the
doors
of
god
are
open
but
we
must
be
ready
and
fitted
to
enter
the
ocean
of
divine
providence
is
surging
but
we
must
be
able
to
swim
the
bestowals
of
the
almighty
are
descending
from
the
heaven
of
grace
but
capacity
to
receive
them
is
essential
the
fountain
of
divine
generosity
is
gushing
forth
but
we
must
have
thirst
for
the
living
waters
unless
there
be
thirst
the
salutary
water
will
not
assuage
unless
the
soul
hungers
the
delicious
foods
of
the
heavenly
table
will
not
give
sustenance
unless
the
eyes
of
perception
be
opened
the
lights
of
the
sun
will
not
be
witnessed
until
the
nostrils
are
purified
the
fragrance
of
the
divine
rose
garden
will
not
be
inhaled
unless
the
heart
be
filled
with
longing
the
favors
of
the
lord
will
not
be
evident
unless
a
perfect
melody
be
sung
the
ears
of
the
hearers
will
not
be
attracted
therefore
we
must
endeavor
night
and
day
to
purify
the
hearts
from
every
dross
sanctify
the
souls
from
every
restriction
and
become
free
from
the
discords
of
the
human
world
then
the
divine
bestowals
will
become
evident
in
their
fullness
and
glory
if
we
do
not
strive
and
sanctify
ourselves
from
the
defects
and
evil
qualities
of
human
nature
we
will
not
partake
of
the
bestowals
of
god
it
is
as
if
the
sun
is
shining
in
its
full
glory
but
no
reflection
is
forthcoming
from
hearts
that
are
black
as
stone
if
an
ocean
of
salubrious
water
is
surging
and
we
be
not
thirsty
what
benefit
do
we
receive
if
the
candle
be
lighted
and
we
have
no
eyes
what
enjoyment
do
we
obtain
from
it
if
melodious
anthems
should
rise
to
the
heavens
and
we
are
bereft
of
hearing
what
enjoyment
can
we
find
therefore
we
must
endeavor
always
cry
supplicate
and
invoke
the
kingdom
of
god
to
grant
us
full
capacity
in
order
that
the
bestowals
of
god
may
become
revealed
and
manifest
in
us
and
as
we
attain
to
these
heavenly
bounties
we
shall
offer
thanks
unto
the
threshold
of
oneness
then
shall
we
rejoice
in
the
lord
that
in
this
wonderful
century
and
glorious
age
under
the
shelter
of
the
kingdom
of
god
we
have
enjoyed
these
bestowals
and
will
arise
in
praise
and
thanksgiving
therefore
i
first
exhort
myself
and
then
i
entreat
you
to
appreciate
this
great
bestowal
recognize
this
most
great
guidance
accept
these
bounties
of
the
lord
you
must
endeavor
day
and
night
to
become
worthy
of
a
generous
portion
of
these
gifts
and
realize
full
capacity
of
attainment
praise
be
to
god
your
hearts
are
illumined
your
faces
are
turned
toward
the
kingdom
of
god
it
is
my
hope
that
all
of
these
degrees
may
be
reached
and
these
friends
attain
a
station
which
shall
be
an
example
and
stimulus
for
all
friends
in
the
world
may
the
love
of
god
spread
from
here
onward
and
outward
may
the
knowledge
of
god
be
sent
broadcast
from
this
place
may
spiritual
forces
become
effective
here
may
the
lights
of
the
kingdom
shine
may
intelligent
souls
be
found
here
so
that
with
all
power
they
may
be
occupied
in
the
service
of
god
furthering
the
oneness
of
the
human
world
and
the
cause
of
the
most
great
peace
may
these
souls
be
lighted
candles
and
fruitful
trees
may
they
be
pearls
of
the
shells
of
providence
may
they
be
stars
of
heaven
this
is
my
supplication
to
god
this
is
my
request
from
the
beauty
of
abha
that
he
may
submerge
all
of
you
in
the
ocean
of
his
grace
afterward
speaking
of
numbers
such
suppositions
regarding
lucky
or
unlucky
numbers
are
purely
imaginary
the
superstition
concerning
thirteen
had
its
origin
in
the
fact
that
jesus
christ
was
surrounded
by
twelve
disciples
and
that
judas
iscariot
was
the
thirteenth
member
of
their
gathering
this
is
the
source
of
the
superstition
but
it
is
purely
imaginary
although
judas
was
outwardly
a
disciple
in
reality
he
was
not
twelve
is
the
original
number
of
significance
and
completion
jacob
had
twelve
sons
from
whom
descended
twelve
tribes
the
disciples
of
jesus
were
twelve
the
imams
of
muhammad
were
twelve
the
zodiacal
signs
are
twelve
the
months
of
the
year
are
twelve
etc
the
mysteries
of
the
holy
books
have
become
explained
in
the
manifestation
of
bahaullah
before
he
appeared
these
mysteries
were
not
understood
bahaullah
opened
and
unsealed
these
mysteries
it
was
my
wish
to
come
here
today
to
have
this
meeting
june
talk
at
central
congregational
church
hancock
street
brooklyn
new
york
notes
by
esther
foster
this
is
a
goodly
temple
and
congregation
forpraise
be
to
godthis
is
a
house
of
worship
wherein
conscientious
opinion
has
free
sway
every
religion
and
every
religious
aspiration
may
be
freely
voiced
and
expressed
here
just
as
in
the
world
of
politics
there
is
need
for
free
thought
likewise
in
the
world
of
religion
there
should
be
the
right
of
unrestricted
individual
belief
consider
what
a
vast
difference
exists
between
modern
democracy
and
the
old
forms
of
despotism
under
an
autocratic
government
the
opinions
of
men
are
not
free
and
development
is
stifled
whereas
in
democracy
because
thought
and
speech
are
not
restricted
the
greatest
progress
is
witnessed
it
is
likewise
true
in
the
world
of
religion
when
freedom
of
conscience
liberty
of
thought
and
right
of
speech
prevailthat
is
to
say
when
every
man
according
to
his
own
idealization
may
give
expression
to
his
beliefsdevelopment
and
growth
are
inevitable
therefore
this
is
a
blessed
church
because
its
pulpit
is
open
to
every
religion
the
ideals
of
which
may
be
set
forth
with
openness
and
freedom
for
this
reason
i
am
most
grateful
to
the
reverend
doctor
i
find
him
indeed
a
servant
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
the
holy
manifestations
who
have
been
the
sources
or
founders
of
the
various
religious
systems
were
united
and
agreed
in
purpose
and
teaching
abraham
moses
zoroaster
buddha
jesus
muhammad
the
bab
and
bahaullah
are
one
in
spirit
and
reality
moreover
each
prophet
fulfilled
the
promise
of
the
one
who
came
before
him
and
likewise
each
announced
the
one
who
would
follow
consider
how
abraham
foretold
the
coming
of
moses
and
moses
embodied
the
abrahamic
statement
moses
prophesied
the
messianic
cycle
and
christ
fulfilled
the
law
of
moses
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
holy
manifestations
who
founded
the
religious
systems
are
united
and
agreed
there
is
no
differentiation
possible
in
their
mission
and
teachings
all
are
reflectors
of
reality
and
all
are
promulgators
of
the
religion
of
god
the
divine
religion
is
reality
and
reality
is
not
multiple
it
is
one
therefore
the
foundations
of
the
religious
systems
are
one
because
all
proceed
from
the
indivisible
reality
but
the
followers
of
these
systems
have
disagreed
discord
strife
and
warfare
have
arisen
among
them
for
they
have
forsaken
the
foundation
and
held
to
that
which
is
but
imitation
and
semblance
inasmuch
as
imitations
differ
enmity
and
dissension
have
resulted
for
example
jesus
christmay
my
spirit
be
a
sacrifice
unto
himlaid
the
foundation
of
eternal
reality
but
after
his
departure
many
sects
and
divisions
appeared
in
christianity
what
was
the
cause
of
this
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
originated
in
dogmatic
imitations
for
the
foundations
of
christ
were
reality
itself
in
which
no
divergence
exists
when
imitations
appeared
sects
and
denominations
were
formed
if
christians
of
all
denominations
and
divisions
should
investigate
reality
the
foundations
of
christ
will
unite
them
no
enmity
or
hatred
will
remain
for
they
will
all
be
under
the
one
guidance
of
reality
itself
likewise
in
the
wider
field
if
all
the
existing
religious
systems
will
turn
away
from
ancestral
imitations
and
investigate
reality
seeking
the
real
meanings
of
the
holy
books
they
will
unite
and
agree
upon
the
same
foundation
reality
itself
as
long
as
they
follow
counterfeit
doctrines
or
imitations
instead
of
reality
animosity
and
discord
will
exist
and
increase
let
me
illustrate
this
moses
and
the
prophets
of
israel
announced
the
advent
of
the
messiah
but
expressed
it
in
the
language
of
symbols
when
christ
appeared
the
jews
rejected
him
although
they
were
expecting
his
manifestation
and
in
their
temples
and
synagogues
were
crying
and
lamenting
saying
o
god
hasten
the
coming
of
the
messiah
why
did
they
deny
him
when
he
announced
himself
because
they
had
followed
ancestral
forms
and
interpretations
and
were
blind
to
the
reality
of
christ
they
had
not
perceived
the
inner
significances
of
the
holy
bible
they
voiced
their
objections
saying
we
are
expecting
christ
but
his
coming
is
conditioned
upon
certain
fulfillments
and
prophetic
announcements
among
the
signs
of
his
appearance
is
one
that
he
shall
come
from
an
unknown
place
whereas
now
this
claimant
of
messiahship
has
come
from
nazareth
we
know
his
home
and
we
are
acquainted
with
his
mother
second
one
of
the
signs
or
messianic
conditions
is
that
his
scepter
would
be
an
iron
rod
and
this
christ
has
not
even
a
wooden
staff
third
he
was
to
be
seated
upon
the
throne
of
david
whereas
this
messianic
king
is
in
the
utmost
state
of
poverty
and
has
not
even
a
mat
fourth
he
was
to
conquer
the
east
and
the
west
this
person
has
not
even
conquered
a
village
how
can
he
be
the
messiah
fifth
he
was
to
promulgate
the
laws
of
the
bible
this
one
has
not
only
failed
to
promulgate
the
laws
of
the
bible
but
he
has
broken
the
law
of
the
sabbath
sixth
the
messiah
was
to
gather
together
all
the
jews
who
were
scattered
in
palestine
and
restore
them
to
honor
and
prestige
but
this
one
has
degraded
the
jews
instead
of
uplifting
them
seventh
during
his
sovereignty
even
the
animals
were
to
enjoy
blessings
and
comfort
for
according
to
the
prophetic
texts
he
should
establish
peace
to
such
a
universal
extent
that
the
eagle
and
quail
would
live
together
the
lion
and
deer
would
feed
in
the
same
meadow
the
wolf
and
lamb
would
lie
down
in
the
same
pasture
in
the
human
kingdom
warfare
was
to
cease
entirely
spears
would
be
turned
into
pruning
hooks
and
swords
into
plowshares
now
we
see
in
the
day
of
this
wouldbe
messiah
such
injustice
prevails
that
even
he
himself
is
sacrificed
how
could
he
be
the
promised
christ
and
so
they
spoke
infamous
words
regarding
him
now
inasmuch
as
the
jews
were
submerged
in
the
sea
of
ancestral
imitations
they
could
not
comprehend
the
meaning
of
these
prophecies
all
the
words
of
the
prophets
were
fulfilled
but
because
the
jews
held
tenaciously
to
hereditary
interpretations
they
did
not
understand
the
inner
meanings
of
the
holy
bible
therefore
they
denied
jesus
christ
the
messiah
the
purpose
of
the
prophetic
words
was
not
the
outward
or
literal
meaning
but
the
inner
symbolical
significance
for
example
it
was
announced
that
the
messiah
was
to
come
from
an
unknown
place
this
did
not
refer
to
the
birthplace
of
the
physical
body
of
jesus
it
has
reference
to
the
reality
of
the
christthat
is
to
say
the
christ
reality
was
to
appear
from
the
invisible
realmfor
the
divine
reality
of
christ
is
holy
and
sanctified
above
place
his
sword
was
to
be
a
sword
of
iron
this
signified
his
tongue
which
should
separate
the
true
from
the
false
and
by
which
great
sword
of
attack
he
would
conquer
the
kingdoms
of
hearts
he
did
not
conquer
by
the
physical
power
of
an
iron
rod
he
conquered
the
east
and
the
west
by
the
sword
of
his
utterance
he
was
seated
upon
the
throne
of
david
but
his
sovereignty
was
neither
a
napoleonic
sovereignty
nor
the
vanishing
dominion
of
a
pharaoh
the
christ
kingdom
was
everlasting
eternal
in
the
heaven
of
the
divine
will
by
his
promulgating
the
laws
of
the
bible
the
reality
of
the
law
of
moses
was
meant
the
sinaitic
law
is
the
foundation
of
the
reality
of
christianity
christ
promulgated
it
and
gave
it
higher
spiritual
expression
he
conquered
and
subdued
the
east
and
west
his
conquest
was
effected
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
which
eliminated
all
boundaries
and
shone
from
all
horizons
in
his
day
according
to
prophecy
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
were
to
drink
from
the
same
fountain
this
was
realized
in
christ
the
fountain
referred
to
was
the
gospel
from
which
the
water
of
life
gushes
forth
the
wolf
and
lamb
are
opposed
and
divergent
races
symbolized
by
these
animals
their
meeting
and
association
were
impossible
but
having
become
believers
in
jesus
christ
those
who
were
formerly
as
wolves
and
lambs
became
united
through
the
words
of
the
gospel
the
purport
is
that
all
the
meanings
of
the
prophecies
were
fulfilled
but
because
the
jews
were
captives
of
ancestral
imitations
and
did
not
perceive
the
reality
of
the
meanings
of
these
words
they
denied
christ
nay
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
crucify
him
consider
how
harmful
is
imitation
these
were
interpretations
handed
down
from
fathers
and
ancestors
and
because
the
jews
held
fast
to
them
they
were
deprived
it
is
evident
then
that
we
must
forsake
all
such
imitations
and
beliefs
so
that
we
may
not
commit
this
error
we
must
investigate
reality
lay
aside
selfish
notions
and
banish
hearsay
from
our
minds
the
jews
consider
christ
the
enemy
of
moses
whereas
on
the
contrary
christ
promoted
the
word
of
moses
he
spread
the
name
of
moses
throughout
the
orient
and
occident
he
promulgated
the
teachings
of
moses
had
it
not
been
for
christ
you
would
not
have
heard
the
name
of
moses
and
unless
the
manifestation
of
messiahship
had
appeared
in
christ
we
would
not
have
received
the
old
testament
the
truth
is
that
christ
fulfilled
the
mosaic
law
and
in
every
way
upheld
moses
but
the
jews
blinded
by
imitations
and
prejudices
considered
him
the
enemy
of
moses
among
the
great
religious
systems
of
the
world
is
islam
about
three
hundred
million
people
acknowledge
it
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
there
has
been
enmity
and
strife
between
muslims
and
christians
owing
to
misunderstanding
and
spiritual
blindness
if
prejudices
and
imitations
were
abandoned
there
would
be
no
enmity
whatever
between
them
and
these
hundreds
of
millions
of
antagonistic
religionists
would
adorn
the
world
of
humanity
by
their
unity
i
wish
now
to
call
your
attention
to
a
most
important
point
all
islam
considers
the
quran
the
word
of
god
in
this
sacred
book
there
are
explicit
texts
which
are
not
traditional
stating
that
christ
was
the
word
of
god
that
he
was
the
spirit
of
god
that
jesus
christ
came
into
this
world
through
the
quickening
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
that
mary
his
mother
was
holy
and
sanctified
in
the
quran
a
whole
chapter
is
devoted
to
the
story
of
jesus
it
records
that
in
the
time
of
his
youth
he
worshiped
god
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
that
manna
descended
from
heaven
for
his
sustenance
and
that
he
uttered
words
immediately
after
his
birth
in
brief
in
the
quran
there
is
eulogy
and
commendation
of
christ
such
as
you
do
not
find
in
the
gospel
the
gospel
does
not
record
that
the
child
jesus
spoke
at
birth
or
that
god
caused
sustenance
to
descend
from
heaven
for
him
but
in
the
quran
it
is
repeatedly
stated
that
god
sent
down
manna
day
by
day
as
food
for
him
furthermore
it
is
significant
and
convincing
that
when
muhammad
proclaimed
his
work
and
mission
his
first
objection
to
his
own
followers
was
why
have
you
not
believed
on
jesus
christ
why
have
you
not
accepted
the
gospel
why
have
you
not
believed
in
moses
why
have
you
not
followed
the
precepts
of
the
old
testament
why
have
you
not
understood
the
prophets
of
israel
why
have
you
not
believed
in
the
disciples
of
christ
the
first
duty
incumbent
upon
ye
o
arabians
is
to
accept
and
believe
in
these
you
must
consider
moses
as
a
prophet
you
must
accept
jesus
christ
as
the
word
of
god
you
must
know
the
old
and
the
new
testaments
as
the
word
of
god
you
must
believe
in
jesus
christ
as
the
product
of
the
holy
spirit
his
people
answered
o
muhammad
we
will
become
believers
although
our
fathers
and
ancestors
were
not
believers
and
we
are
proud
of
them
tell
us
what
is
going
to
become
of
them
muhammad
replied
i
declare
unto
you
that
they
occupy
the
lowest
stratum
of
hell
because
they
did
not
believe
in
moses
and
christ
and
because
they
did
not
accept
the
bible
and
although
they
are
my
own
ancestors
yet
they
are
in
despair
in
hell
this
is
an
explicit
text
of
the
quran
it
is
not
a
story
or
tradition
but
from
the
quran
itself
which
is
in
the
hands
of
the
people
therefore
it
is
evident
that
ignorance
and
misunderstanding
have
caused
so
much
warfare
and
strife
between
christians
and
muslims
if
both
should
investigate
the
underlying
truth
of
their
religious
beliefs
the
outcome
would
be
unity
and
agreement
strife
and
bitterness
would
pass
away
forever
and
the
world
of
humanity
find
peace
and
composure
consider
that
there
are
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
christians
and
three
hundred
million
muslims
how
much
blood
has
flowed
in
their
wars
how
many
nations
have
been
destroyed
how
many
children
have
been
made
fatherless
how
many
fathers
and
mothers
have
mourned
the
loss
of
children
and
dear
ones
all
this
has
been
due
to
prejudice
misunderstanding
and
imitations
of
ancestral
beliefs
without
investigation
of
reality
if
the
holy
books
were
rightly
understood
none
of
this
discord
and
distress
would
have
existed
but
love
and
fellowship
would
have
prevailed
instead
this
is
true
with
all
the
other
religions
as
well
the
conditions
i
have
named
will
apply
equally
to
all
the
essential
purpose
of
the
religion
of
god
is
to
establish
unity
among
mankind
the
divine
manifestations
were
founders
of
the
means
of
fellowship
and
love
they
did
not
come
to
create
discord
strife
and
hatred
in
the
world
the
religion
of
god
is
the
cause
of
love
but
if
it
is
made
to
be
the
source
of
enmity
and
bloodshed
surely
its
absence
is
preferable
to
its
existence
for
then
it
becomes
satanic
detrimental
and
an
obstacle
to
the
human
world
in
the
orient
the
various
peoples
and
nations
were
in
a
state
of
antagonism
and
strife
manifesting
the
utmost
enmity
and
hatred
toward
each
other
darkness
encompassed
the
world
of
mankind
at
such
a
time
as
this
bahaullah
appeared
he
removed
all
the
imitations
and
prejudices
which
had
caused
separation
and
misunderstanding
and
laid
the
foundation
of
the
one
religion
of
god
when
this
was
accomplished
muslims
christians
jews
zoroastrians
buddhists
all
were
united
in
actual
fellowship
and
love
the
souls
who
followed
bahaullah
from
every
nation
have
become
as
one
family
living
in
agreement
and
accord
willing
to
sacrifice
life
for
each
other
the
muslim
will
give
his
life
for
the
christian
the
christian
for
the
jew
and
all
of
them
for
the
zoroastrian
they
live
together
in
love
fellowship
and
unity
they
have
attained
to
the
condition
of
rebirth
in
the
spirit
of
god
they
have
become
revivified
and
regenerated
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
praise
be
to
god
this
light
has
come
forth
from
the
east
and
eventually
there
shall
be
no
discord
or
enmity
in
the
orient
through
the
power
of
bahaullah
all
will
be
united
he
upraised
this
standard
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
in
prison
when
subjected
to
banishment
by
two
kings
while
a
refugee
from
enemies
of
all
nations
and
during
the
days
of
his
long
imprisonment
he
wrote
to
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
world
in
words
of
wonderful
eloquence
arraigning
them
severely
and
summoning
them
to
the
divine
standard
of
unity
and
justice
he
exhorted
them
to
peace
and
international
agreement
making
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
establish
a
board
of
international
arbitrationthat
from
all
nations
and
governments
of
the
world
there
should
be
delegates
selected
for
a
congress
of
nations
which
should
constitute
a
universal
arbitral
court
of
justice
to
settle
international
disputes
he
wrote
to
victoria
queen
of
great
britain
the
czar
of
russia
the
emperor
of
germany
napoleon
iii
of
france
and
others
inviting
them
to
world
unity
and
peace
through
a
heavenly
power
he
was
enabled
to
promulgate
these
ideals
in
the
orient
kings
could
not
withstand
him
they
endeavored
to
extinguish
his
light
but
served
only
to
increase
its
intensity
and
illumination
while
in
prison
he
stood
against
the
shah
of
persia
and
sultan
of
turkey
and
promulgated
his
teachings
until
he
firmly
established
the
banner
of
truth
and
the
oneness
of
humankind
i
was
a
prisoner
with
him
for
forty
years
until
the
young
turks
of
the
committee
of
union
and
progress
overthrew
the
despotism
of
abdulhamid
dethroned
him
and
proclaimed
liberty
this
committee
set
me
free
from
tyranny
and
oppression
otherwise
i
should
have
been
in
prison
until
the
days
of
my
life
were
ended
the
purport
is
this
that
bahaullah
in
prison
was
able
to
proclaim
and
establish
the
foundations
of
peace
although
two
despotic
kings
were
his
enemies
and
oppressors
the
king
of
persia
nasiriddin
shah
had
killed
twenty
thousand
bahais
martyrs
who
in
absolute
severance
and
complete
willingness
offered
their
lives
joyfully
for
their
faith
these
two
powerful
and
tyrannical
kings
could
not
withstand
a
prisoner
this
prisoner
upheld
the
standard
of
humanity
and
brought
the
people
of
the
orient
into
agreement
and
unity
today
in
the
east
only
those
who
have
not
followed
bahaullah
are
in
opposition
and
enmity
the
people
of
the
nations
who
have
accepted
him
as
the
standard
of
divine
guidance
enjoy
a
condition
of
actual
fellowship
and
love
if
you
should
attend
a
meeting
in
the
east
you
could
not
distinguish
between
christian
and
muslim
you
would
not
know
which
was
jew
zoroastrian
or
buddhist
so
completely
have
they
become
fraternized
and
their
religious
differences
been
leveled
they
associate
in
the
utmost
love
and
spiritual
fragrance
as
if
they
belonged
to
one
family
as
if
they
were
one

notes
by

c
melick
we
should
all
visit
the
sick
when
they
are
in
sorrow
and
suffering
it
is
a
real
help
and
benefit
to
have
a
friend
come
happiness
is
a
great
healer
to
those
who
are
ill
in
the
east
it
is
the
custom
to
call
upon
the
patient
often
and
meet
him
individually
the
people
in
the
east
show
the
utmost
kindness
and
compassion
to
the
sick
and
suffering
this
has
greater
effect
than
the
remedy
itself
you
must
always
have
this
thought
of
love
and
affection
when
you
visit
the
ailing
and
afflicted
the
world
of
humanity
may
be
likened
to
the
individual
man
himself
it
has
its
illness
and
ailments
a
patient
must
be
diagnosed
by
a
skillful
physician
the
prophets
of
god
are
the
real
physicians
in
whatever
age
or
time
they
appear
they
prescribe
for
human
conditions
they
know
the
sicknesses
they
discover
the
hidden
sources
of
disease
and
indicate
the
necessary
remedy
whosoever
is
healed
by
that
remedy
finds
eternal
health
for
instance
in
the
day
of
jesus
christ
the
world
of
humanity
was
afflicted
with
various
ailments
jesus
christ
was
the
real
physician
he
appeared
recognized
the
symptoms
and
prescribed
the
real
remedy
what
was
that
remedy
it
was
his
revealed
teaching
especially
applicable
to
that
age
later
on
many
new
ailments
and
disorders
appeared
in
the
body
politic
the
world
became
sick
other
severe
maladies
appeared
especially
in
the
peninsula
of
arabia
god
manifested
muhammad
there
he
came
and
prescribed
for
the
conditions
so
that
the
arabs
became
healthy
strong
and
virile
in
that
time
in
this
present
age
the

no
matter
how
much
the
world
of
humanity
advances
in
material
civilization
it
is
nevertheless
in
need
of
the
spiritual
development
mentioned
in
the
gospel
the
virtues
of
the
material
world
are
limited
whereas
divine
virtues
are
unlimited
inasmuch
as
material
virtues
are
limited
mans
need
of
the
perfections
of
the
divine
world
is
unlimited
throughout
human
history
we
find
that
although
the
very
apex
of
human
virtues
has
been
reached
at
various
times
yet
they
were
limited
whereas
divine
attainments
have
ever
been
unbounded
and
infinite
the
limited
is
ever
in
need
of
the
unlimited
the
material
must
be
correlated
with
the
spiritual
the
material
may
be
likened
to
the
body
but
divine
virtues
are
the
breathings
of
the
holy
spirit
itself
the
body
without
spirit
is
not
capable
of
real
accomplishment
although
it
may
be
in
the
utmost
condition
of
beauty
and
excellence
it
is
nevertheless
in
need
of
the
spirit
the
chimney
of
the
lamp
no
matter
how
polished
and
perfect
it
be
is
in
need
of
the
light
without
the
light
the
lamp
or
candle
is
not
illuminating
without
the
spirit
the
body
is
not
productive
the
teacher
of
material
principles
is
limited
the
philosophers
who
claimed
to
be
the
educators
of
mankind
were
at
most
only
able
to
train
themselves
if
they
educated
others
it
was
within
a
restricted
circle
they
failed
to
bestow
general
education
and
development
this
has
been
conferred
upon
humanity
by
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
for
example
christ
educated
and
developed
mankind
universally
he
rescued
nations
and
peoples
from
the
bondage
of
superstition
and
idolatry
he
summoned
them
all
to
the
knowledge
of
the
oneness
of
god
they
were
dark
they
became
illumined
they
were
material
they
became
spiritual
earthly
they
were
they
became
heavenly
he
enlightened
the
world
of
morality
this
general
universal
development
is
not
possible
through
the
power
of
philosophy
it
is
only
attainable
through
the
pervading
influence
of
the
holy
spirit
therefore
no
matter
how
far
the
world
of
humanity
advances
it
fails
to
attain
the
highest
degree
unless
quickened
by
the
education
and
divine
bestowals
of
the
holy
spirit
this
ensures
human
progress
and
prosperity
therefore
i
exhort
you
to
be
devoted
to
your
spiritual
development
just
as
you
have
striven
along
material
lines
and
have
attained
to
high
degrees
of
worldly
advancement
may
you
likewise
become
strengthened
and
proficient
in
the
knowledge
of
god
may
divine
susceptibilities
be
increased
and
awakened
may
your
devotion
to
the
heavenly
kingdom
become
intense
may
you
be
the
recipients
of
the
impulses
of
the
holy
spirit
be
assisted
in
the
world
of
morality
and
attain
ideal
power
so
that
the
sublimity
of
the
world
of
mankind
may
become
apparent
in
you
thus
may
you
attain
the
highest
happiness
the
eternal
life
the
everlasting
glory
the
second
birth
and
become
manifestations
of
the
bestowals
of
god

macnutt
i
am
about
to
leave
the
city
for
a
few
days
rest
at
montclair
when
i
return
it
is
my
wish
to
give
a
large
feast
of
unity
a
place
for
it
has
not
yet
been
found
it
must
be
outdoors
under
the
trees
in
some
location
away
from
city
noiselike
a
persian
garden
the
food
will
be
persian
food
when
the
place
is
arranged
all
will
be
informed
and
we
will
have
a
general
meeting
in
which
hearts
will
be
bound
together
spirits
blended
and
a
new
foundation
for
unity
established
all
the
friends
will
come
they
will
be
my
guests
they
will
be
as
the
parts
and
members
of
one
body
the
spirit
of
life
manifest
in
that
body
will
be
one
spirit
the
foundation
of
that
temple
of
unity
will
be
one
foundation
each
will
be
a
stone
in
that
foundation
solid
and
interdependent
each
will
be
as
a
leaf
blossom
or
fruit
upon
one
tree
for
the
sake
of
fellowship
and
unity
i
desire
this
feast
and
spiritual
gathering
whatsoever
is
conducive
to
unity
is
merciful
and
from
the
divine
bounty
itself
every
universal
affair
is
divine
everything
which
conduces
to
separation
and
estrangement
is
satanic
because
it
emanates
from
the
purposes
of
self
consider
how
clearly
it
is
shown
in
creation
that
the
cause
of
existence
is
unity
and
cohesion
and
the
cause
of
nonexistence
is
separation
and
dissension
by
a
divine
power
of
creation
the
elements
assemble
together
in
affinity
and
the
result
is
a
composite
being
certain
of
these
elements
have
united
and
man
has
come
into
existence
certain
other
combinations
produce
plants
and
animals
therefore
this
affinity
of
the
inanimate
elements
is
the
cause
of
life
and
being
through
their
commingling
therefore
human
affinity
love
and
fellowship
are
made
possible
if
the
elements
were
not
assembled
together
in
affinity
to
produce
the
body
of
man
the
higher
intelligent
forces
could
not
be
manifest
in
the
body
but
when
these
elements
separate
when
their
affinity
and
cohesion
are
overcome
death
and
dissolution
of
the
body
they
have
built
inevitably
follow
therefore
affinity
and
unity
among
even
these
material
elements
mean
life
in
the
body
of
man
and
their
discord
and
disagreement
mean
death
throughout
all
creation
in
all
the
kingdoms
this
law
is
written
that
love
and
affinity
are
the
cause
of
life
and
discord
and
separation
are
the
cause
of
death
consider
the
bodies
of
all
the
natural
organisms
certain
elements
have
gathered
and
combine
in
chemical
affinity
the
tree
the
man
the
fish
are
due
to
this
attraction
and
cohesion
which
have
brought
the
elements
together
a
composition
or
composite
being
has
resulted
the
outcome
of
certain
atomic
grouping
for
instance
is
a
mirror
table
or
clock
because
a
cohesive
power
has
magnetized
and
bound
these
atoms
together
when
that
attracting
power
is
withdrawn
dissolution
and
disintegration
follow
no
mirror
table
or
clock
remainno
trace
no
existence
therefore
commingling
of
the
atoms
brings
forth
a
reality
while
dispersion
or
dissemination
of
them
is
equivalent
to
nonexistence
study
the
law
of
affinity
among
the
domestic
animals
they
manifest
fellowship
they
live
in
flocks
and
herds
the
love
of
association
is
evident
among
them
among
birds
we
see
evidences
of
instinctive
fellowship
and
love
but
the
ferocious
animals
and
birds
of
prey
are
just
the
reverse
of
the
domestic
sheep
cows
and
horses
graze
together
in
concord
and
agreement
but
ferocious
animals
are
never
seen
associating
in
love
and
fellowship
each
lives
solitary
and
alone
or
with
a
single
mate
when
they
see
each
other
they
manifest
the
utmost
ferocity
dogs
pounce
upon
dogs
wolves
tigers
lions
rage
snarl
and
fight
to
the
death
their
ferocity
is
instinctive
there
is
a
creative
reason
for
it
birds
of
prey
like
eagles
and
hawks
live
solitary
and
build
their
nests
apart
but
doves
fly
in
flocks
and
nest
in
the
same
branches
when
an
eagle
meets
another
eagle
there
is
a
furious
battle
the
meeting
of
two
doves
is
a
peace
meeting
therefore
it
is
evident
that
these
blessed
characteristics
as
well
as
the
reverse
are
found
among
the
creatures
of
a
lower
kingdom
the
great
mass
of
humanity
does
not
exercise
real
love
and
fellowship
the
elect
of
humanity
are
those
who
live
together
in
love
and
unity
they
are
preferable
before
god
because
the
divine
attributes
are
already
manifest
in
them
the
supreme
love
and
unity
is
witnessed
in
the
divine
manifestations
among
them
unity
is
indissoluble
changeless
eternal
and
everlasting
each
one
is
expressive
and
representative
of
all
if
we
deny
one
of
the
manifestations
of
god
we
deny
all
to
inflict
persecution
upon
one
is
to
persecute
the
others
in
all
degrees
of
existence
each
one
praises
and
sanctifies
the
others
each
of
them
holds
to
the
solidarity
of
mankind
and
promotes
the
unity
of
human
hearts
next
to
the
divine
manifestations
come
the
believers
whose
characteristics
are
agreement
fellowship
and
love
the
bahai
friends
in
persia
attained
such
a
brotherhood
and
love
that
it
really
became
a
hindrance
in
the
conduct
of
material
affairs
each
one
into
whatever
house
of
the
friends
he
went
considered
himself
the
owner
of
the
house
so
to
speak
there
was
no
duality
but
complete
mutuality
of
interests
and
love
the
visiting
friend
would
have
no
hesitation
in
opening
the
provision
box
and
taking
out
enough
food
for
his
needs
they
wore
each
others
clothes
as
their
own
when
necessary
if
in
need
of
a
hat
or
cloak
they
would
take
and
use
it
the
owner
of
the
clothing
would
be
thankful
and
grateful
that
the
garment
had
gone
when
he
returned
home
he
would
perhaps
be
told
so
and
so
was
here
and
took
away
your
coat
he
would
reply
praise
be
to
god
i
am
so
grateful
to
him
praise
be
to
god
i
am
so
thankful
i
have
been
given
this
opportunity
of
showing
my
love
for
him
to
such
an
extreme
degree
this
love
and
fellowship
expressed
itself
that
bahaullah
commanded
that
no
one
should
take
possession
of
anothers
belongings
unless
presented
with
them
the
intention
is
to
show
to
what
an
extent
unity
and
love
prevailed
among
the
bahai
friends
in
the
east
i
hope
that
this
same
degree
and
intensity
of
love
may
become
manifest
and
apparent
here
that
the
spirit
of
god
shall
so
penetrate
your
hearts
that
each
one
of
the
beloved
of
god
shall
be
considered
as
all
that
each
one
may
become
a
cause
of
unity
and
center
of
accord
and
all
mankind
be
bound
together
in
real
fellowship

love

abdulbaha

the

of
the

if
you

smile
now
for
what
time
will
you
await
and
what
greater
happiness
could
you
expect
this
is
the
springtime
of
manifestation
the
vernal
shower
has
descended
from
the
cloud
of
divine
mercy
the
lifegiving
breeze
of
the
holy
spirit
is
wafting
the
perfume
of
blossoms
from
field
and
meadow
rises
a
fragrant
breath
of
thanksgiving
like
pure
incense
ascending
to
the
throne
of
god
the
world
has
become
a
new
world
souls
are
quickened
spirits
renewed
refreshed
truly
it
is
a
time
for
happiness
to
people
coming
in
welcome
welcome
you
are
very
welcome
the
church
bells
begin
to
ring
i
was
not
feeling
very
well
this
morning
or
i
would
have
gone
to
church
everywhere
we
hear
the
call
of
the
spiritual
world
in
everything
we
behold
the
works
of
god
the
church
bells
are
pealing
in
memory
of
jesus
christ
although
more
than
nineteen
hundred
years
have
passed
since
he
lived
upon
the
earth
this
is
through
the
power
of
the
spirit
no
material
power
could
do
this
yet
people
in
their
blindness
deny
christ
seeking
to
perpetuate
their
names
in
worldly
deeds
everyone
wishes
to
be
remembered
through
earthly
and
material
accomplishments
one
will
hardly
be
remembered
nine
years
while
the
memory
and
glory
of
christ
continue
after
nineteen
hundred
have
passed
for
his
name
is
eternal
and
his
glory
everlasting
therefore
man
should
hear
with
attentive
ear
the
call
of
the
spiritual
world
seeking
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
its
perfections
this
is
eternal
life
this
is
everlasting
remembrance
how
great
the
difference
between
the
glory
of
christ
and
the
glory
of
an
earthly
conqueror
it
is
related
by
historians
that
napoleon
bonaparte
i
embarked
secretly
by
night
from
egypt
his
destination
was
france
during
his
campaign
in
palestine
revolution
had
broken
out
and
grave
difficulties
had
arisen
in
the
home
government
christian
worship
had
been
forbidden
by
the
revolutionists
the
priests
of
christianity
had
fled
in
terror
france
had
become
atheistic
anarchy
prevailed
the
ship
sailed
out
into
a
night
brilliant
with
the
light
of
the
moon
napoleon
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
deck
his
officers
were
sitting
together
talking
one
of
them
spoke
of
the
similarity
between
bonaparte
and
christ
napoleon
stopped
and
said
grimly
do
you
think
i
am
going
back
to
france
to
establish
religion
jesus
christ
established
the
religion
of
god
through
love
his
sovereignty
is
everlasting
napoleon
overthrew
governments
in
war
and
bloodshed
his
dominion
passed
away
he
himself
was
dethroned
bonaparte
destroyed
human
life
christ
was
a
savior
bonaparte
controlled
the
physical
bodies
of
men
christ
was
a
conqueror
of
human
hearts
none
of
the
prophets
of
god
were
famous
men
but
they
were
unique
in
spiritual
power
love
is
the
eternal
sovereignty
love
is
the
divine
power
by
it
all
the
kings
of
earth
are
overthrown
and
conquered
what
evidence
of
this
could
be
greater
than
the
accomplishment
of
bahaullah
he
appeared
in
the
east
and
was
exiled
he
was
sent
to
the
prison
of
akka
in
palestine
two
powerful
despotic
kings
arose
against
him
during
his
exile
and
imprisonment
he
wrote
tablets
of
authority
to
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
world
announcing
his
spiritual
sovereignty
establishing
the
religion
of
god
upraising
the
heavenly
banners
of
the
cause
of
god
one
of
these
tablets
was
sent
to
napoleon
iii
emperor
of
france
he
received
it
with
contempt
and
cast
it
behind
his
back
bahaullah
addressed
a
second
tablet
to
him
containing
these
words
hadst
thou
been
sincere
in
thy
words
thou
wouldst
have
not
cast
behind
thy
back
the
book
of
god
when
it
was
sent
unto
thee
we
have
proved
thee
through
it
and
found
thee
other
than
that
which
thou
didst
profess
arise
and
make
amends
for
that
which
escaped
thee
erelong
the
world
and
all
that
thou
possessest
will
perish
and
the
kingdom
will
remain
unto
god
for
what
thou
hast
done
thy
kingdom
shall
be
thrown
into
confusion
and
thine
empire
shall
pass
from
thine
hands
as
a
punishment
for
that
which
thou
hast
wrought
then
wilt
thou
know
how
thou
hast
plainly
erred
thy
pomp
shall
soon
pass
away
unless
thou
holdest
fast
by
this
firm
cord
we
see
abasement
hastening
after
thee
all
this
happened
just
as
announced
by
bahaullah
napoleon
iii
was
dethroned
and
exiled
his
empire
passed
away
and
became
nonexistent
while
the
dominion
and
sovereignty
of
bahaullah
the
prisoner
has
become
eternal
through
the
confirmation
of
god
this
is
as
evident
as
the
light
of
the
sun
at
midday
except
to
those
who
are
spiritually
blind
if
we
are
afflicted
with
a
cold
we
cannot
inhale
the
delicate
fragrances
emanating
from
the
rose
garden
of
the
divine
kingdom
in
brief
the
nations
of
the
world
are
becoming
united
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
divine
kingdom
the
east
and
the
west
are
embracing
here
in
love
and
affection
today
this
is
not
a
commercial
or
political
unity
but
unity
through
the
love
of
god
we
have
crossed
the
sea
to
spread
that
love
in
america
to
announce
the
call
of
the
kingdom
to
establish
the
spiritual
foundations
of
international
peace
although
men
may
arise
against
the
kingdom
the
dominion
and
sovereignty
of
god
will
be
set
up
it
is
an
eternal
kingdom
a
divine
sovereignty
in
his
day
christ
was
called
satan
beelzebub
but
hear
the
bells
now
ringing
for
him
he
was
the
word
of
god
and
not
satan
they
mocked
him
led
him
through
the
city
upon
a
donkey
crowned
him
with
thorns
spat
upon
his
blessed
face
and
crucified
him
but
he
is
now
with
god
and
in
god
because
he
was
the
word
and
not
satan
fifty
years
ago
no
one
would
touch
the
christian
bible
in
persia
bahaullah
came
and
asked
why
they
said
it
is
not
the
word
of
god
he
said
you
must
read
it
with
understanding
of
its
meanings
not
as
those
who
merely
recite
its
words
now
bahais
all
over
the
east
read
the
bible
and
understand
its
spiritual
teaching
bahaullah
spread
the
cause
of
christ
and
opened
the
book
of
the
christians
and
jews
he
removed
the
barriers
of
names
he
proved
that
all
the
divine
prophets
taught
the
same
reality
and
that
to
deny
one
is
to
deny
the
others
for
all
are
in
perfect
oneness
with
god
in
london
some
of
the
christians
said
we
were
deniers
of
christ
we
say
christ
is
the
word
of
god
we
are
gathered
here
this
morning
for
his
mention
the
bells
have
called
us
together
in
love
and
unity
this
house
is
the
temple
of
god
all
are
welcome
very
welcome
question
how
shall
we
determine
the
truth
or
error
of
certain
biblical
interpretation
as
for
instance
the
higher
criticism
and
other
presentday
christian
teachings
abdulbaha
your
question
is
an
abstruse
and
important
one
complete
answer
to
it
would
require
a
long
time
i
will
reply
to
it
briefly
the
only
true
explainer
of
the
book
of
god
is
the
holy
spirit
for
no
two
minds
are
alike
no
two
can
comprehend
alike
no
two
can
speak
alike
that
is
to
say
from
the
mere
human
standpoint
of
interpretation
there
could
be
neither
truth
nor
agreement
question
do
you
approve
of
the
new
thought
in
which
the
control
of
mind
over
matter
is
the
central
principle
abdulbaha
philosophy
develops
the
mind
christ
and
the
word
of
god
are
revealed
through
the
spirit
plato
says
the
mental
conclusions
are
so
and
so
christ
says
be
led
of
the
spirit
question
should
children
be
allowed
to
read
the
higher
criticism
abdulbaha
they
should
first
be
taught
the
reality
of
religion
as
a
foundation
for
instance
in
the
catholic
church
the
child
is
taught
that
through
some
act
of
the
priest
the
bread
and
wine
of
the
sacrament
become
the
flesh
and
blood
of
jesus
christ
the
mind
cannot
accept
this
the
child
must
be
taught
that
this
transformation
is
symbolical
of
the
truth
that
christ
is
the
food
from
heaven
the
eating
of
which
produces
eternal
life
the
jews
had
memorized
the
bible
but
failed
to
grasp
its
meanings
if
they
had
understood
the
spiritual
significances
of
the
scriptures
they
would
have
been
the
first
believers
in
christ
you

there
are
many
of
the

friends
in
persia
whom
we

not
know
but
we

turn
your
faces
to
the
sun
of
reality
that
sun
has
always
risen
in

the

to
your

for
you
are
the
ones
who
are
called
to
uplift
the

first
you

willing

forfeit
life
in

happiness
you
must
be

among

must

in

the

offer
their

for

striving

assist
and
advance
the

and
welfare
of
all
the
rest
they
live
in
a
perfect
state
of

like

friends
you
must
be
perfectly
agreed

united
to
the
extent

limit
of
sacrificing
life
your

pleasure
but
seek
the
pleasure
of
others

desire
glory
nor

for

seek
these
gifts
and
blessings
for
his

neither

live

notes
by
howard
macnutt
what
could
be
better
before
god
than
thinking
of
the
poor
for
the
poor
are
beloved
by
our
heavenly
father
when
christ
came
upon
the
earth
those
who
believed
in
him
and
followed
him
were
the
poor
and
lowly
showing
that
the
poor
were
near
to
god
when
a
rich
man
believes
and
follows
the
manifestation
of
god
it
is
a
proof
that
his
wealth
is
not
an
obstacle
and
does
not
prevent
him
from
attaining
the
pathway
of
salvation
after
he
has
been
tested
and
tried
it
will
be
seen
whether
his
possessions
are
a
hindrance
in
his
religious
life
but
the
poor
are
especially
beloved
of
god
their
lives
are
full
of
difficulties
their
trials
continual
their
hopes
are
in
god
alone
therefore
you
must
assist
the
poor
as
much
as
possible
even
by
sacrifice
of
yourself
no
deed
of
man
is
greater
before
god
than
helping
the
poor
spiritual
conditions
are
not
dependent
upon
the
possession
of
worldly
treasures
or
the
absence
of
them
when
one
is
physically
destitute
spiritual
thoughts
are
more
likely
poverty
is
a
stimulus
toward
god
each
one
of
you
must
have
great
consideration
for
the
poor
and
render
them
assistance
organize
in
an
effort
to
help
them
and
prevent
increase
of
poverty
the
greatest
means
for
prevention
is
that
whereby
the
laws
of
the
community
will
be
so
framed
and
enacted
that
it
will
not
be
possible
for
a
few
to
be
millionaires
and
many
destitute
one
of
bahaullahs
teachings
is
the
adjustment
of
means
of
livelihood
in
human
society
under
this
adjustment
there
can
be
no
extremes
in
human
conditions
as
regards
wealth
and
sustenance
for
the
community
needs
financier
farmer
merchant
and
laborer
just
as
an
army
must
be
composed
of
commander
officers
and
privates
all
cannot
be
commanders
all
cannot
be
officers
or
privates
each
in
his
station
in
the
social
fabric
must
be
competenteach
in
his
function
according
to
ability
but
with
justness
of
opportunity
for
all
lycurgus
king
of
sparta
who
lived
long
before
the
day
of
christ
conceived
the
idea
of
absolute
equality
in
government
he
proclaimed
laws
by
which
all
the
people
of
sparta
were
classified
into
certain
divisions
each
division
had
its
separate
rights
and
function
first
farmers
and
tillers
of
the
soil
second
artisans
and
merchants
third
leaders
or
grandees
under
the
laws
of
lycurgus
the
latter
were
not
required
to
engage
in
any
labor
or
vocation
but
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
defend
the
country
in
case
of
war
and
invasion
then
he
divided
sparta
into
nine
thousand
equal
parts
or
provinces
appointing
nine
thousand
leaders
or
grandees
to
protect
them
in
this
way
the
farmers
of
each
province
were
assured
of
protection
but
each
farmer
was
compelled
to
pay
a
tax
to
support
the
grandee
of
that
province
the
farmers
and
merchants
were
not
obliged
to
defend
the
country
in
lieu
of
labor
the
grandees
received
the
taxes
lycurgus
in
order
to
establish
this
forever
as
a
law
brought
nine
thousand
grandees
together
told
them
he
was
going
upon
a
long
journey
and
wished
this
form
of
government
to
remain
effective
until
his
return
they
swore
an
oath
to
protect
and
preserve
his
law
he
then
left
his
kingdom
went
into
voluntary
exile
and
never
came
back
no
man
ever
made
such
a
sacrifice
to
ensure
equality
among
his
fellowmen
a
few
years
passed
and
the
whole
system
of
government
he
had
founded
collapsed
although
established
upon
such
a
just
and
wise
basis
difference
of
capacity
in
human
individuals
is
fundamental
it
is
impossible
for
all
to
be
alike
all
to
be
equal
all
to
be
wise
bahaullah
has
revealed
principles
and
laws
which
will
accomplish
the
adjustment
of
varying
human
capacities
he
has
said
that
whatsoever
is
possible
of
accomplishment
in
human
government
will
be
effected
through
these
principles
when
the
laws
he
has
instituted
are
carried
out
there
will
be
no
millionaires
possible
in
the
community
and
likewise
no
extremely
poor
this
will
be
effected
and
regulated
by
adjusting
the
different
degrees
of
human
capacity
the
fundamental
basis
of
the
community
is
agriculture
tillage
of
the
soil
all
must
be
producers
each
person
in
the
community
whose
need
is
equal
to
his
individual
producing
capacity
shall
be
exempt
from
taxation
but
if
his
income
is
greater
than
his
needs
he
must
pay
a
tax
until
an
adjustment
is
effected
that
is
to
say
a
mans
capacity
for
production
and
his
needs
will
be
equalized
and
reconciled
through
taxation
if
his
production
exceeds
he
will
pay
a
tax
if
his
necessities
exceed
his
production
he
shall
receive
an
amount
sufficient
to
equalize
or
adjust
therefore
taxation
will
be
proportionate
to
capacity
and
production
and
there
will
be
no
poor
in
the
community
bahaullah
likewise
commanded
the
rich
to
give
freely
to
the
poor
in
the
kitabiaqdas
it
is
further
written
by
him
that
those
who
have
a
certain
amount
of
income
must
give
onefifth
of
it
to
god
the
creator
of
heaven

earth

stated
that
we
are
living
in
a
universal
cycle
the
first
manifestation
of
which
was
adam
and
the
universal
manifestation
of
which
is
bahaullah
does
this
imply
that
other
universal
cycles
preceded
this
one
and
that
all
traces
of
them
have
been
effacedcycles
in
which
the
ultimate
purpose
was
the
divine
spiritualization
of
man
just
as
it
is
the
creative
intention
in
this
one
the
divine
sovereignty
is
an
ancient
sovereignty
not
an
accidental
sovereignty
if
we
imagine
this
world
of
existence
has
a
beginning
we
can
say
the
divine
sovereignty
is
accidentalthat
is
there
was
a
time
when
it
did
not
exist
a
king
without
a
kingdom
is
impossible
he
cannot
be
without
a
country
without
subjects
without
an
army
without
dominion
or
he
would
be
without
kingship
all
these
exigencies
or
requirements
of
sovereignty
must
exist
for
a
king
when
they
do
exist
we
can
apply
the
word
sovereignty
to
him
otherwise
his
sovereignty
is
imperfect
incomplete
if
none
of
these
conditions
exists
sovereignty
does
not
exist
if
we
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
beginning
for
this
world
of
creation
we
acknowledge
that
the
sovereignty
of
god
is
accidentalthat
is
we
admit
a
time
when
the
reality
of
divinity
has
been
without
dominion
lit
defeated
the
names
and
attributes
of
divinity
are
requirements
of
this
world
the
names
the
powerful
the
living
the
provider
the
creator
require
and
necessitate
the
existence
of
creatures
if
there
were
no
creatures
creator
would
be
meaningless
if
there
were
none
to
provide
for
we
could
not
think
of
the
provider
if
there
were
no
life
the
living
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
conception
therefore
all
the
names
and
attributes
of
god
require
the
existence
of
objects
or
creatures
upon
which
they
have
been
bestowed
and
in
which
they
have
become
manifest
if
there
was
a
time
when
no
creation
existed
when
there
was
none
to
provide
for
it
would
imply
a
time
when
there
was
no
existent
one
no
trainer
and
the
attributes
and
qualities
of
god
would
have
been
meaningless
and
without
significance
therefore
the
requirements
of
the
attributes
of
god
do
not
admit
of
cessation
or
interruption
for
the
names
of
god
are
actually
and
forever
existing
and
not
potential
because
they
convey
life
they
are
called
lifegiving
because
they
provide
they
are
called
bountiful
the
provider
because
they
create
they
are
called
creator
because
they
educate
and
govern
the
name
lord
god
is
applied
that
is
to
say
the
divine
names
emanate
from
the
eternal
attributes
of
divinity
therefore
it
is
proved
that
the
divine
names
presuppose
the
existence
of
objects
or
beings
how
then
is
a
time
conceivable
when
this
sovereignty
has
not
been
existent
this
divine
sovereignty
is
not
to
be
measured
by
six
thousand
years
this
interminable
illimitable
universe
is
not
the
result
of
that
measured
period
this
stupendous
laboratory
and
workshop
has
not
been
limited
in
its
production
to
six
thousand
revolutions
of
the
earth
about
the
sun
with
the
slightest
reflection
man
can
be
assured
that
this
calculation
and
announcement
is
childish
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
scientifically
proved
the
terrestrial
globe
has
been
the
habitation
of
man
long
prior
to
such
a
limited
estimate
as
to
the
record
in
the
bible
concerning
adams
entering
paradise
his
eating
from
the
tree
and
his
expulsion
through
the
temptation
of
satan
these
are
all
symbols
beneath
which
there
are
wonderful
and
divine
meanings
not
to
be
calculated
in
years
dates
and
measurement
of
time
likewise
the
statement
that
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
in
six
days
is
symbolic
we
will
not
explain
this
further
today
the
texts
of
the
holy
books
are
all
symbolical
needing
authoritative
interpretation
when
man
casts
even
a
cursory
glance
of
reflection
upon
the
question
of
the
universe
he
discovers
it
is
very
ancient
a
persian
philosopher
was
looking
up
into
the
heavens
lost
in
wonder
he
said
i
have
written
a
book
containing
seventy
proofs
of
the
accidental
appearance
of
the
universe
but
i
still
find
it
very
ancient
bahaullah
says
the
universe
hath
neither
beginning
nor
ending
he
has
set
aside
the
elaborate
theories
and
exhaustive
opinions
of
scientists
and
material
philosophers
by
the
simple
statement
there
is
no
beginning
no
ending
the
theologians
and
religionists
advance
plausible
proofs
that
the
creation
of
the
universe
dates
back
six
thousand
years
the
scientists
bring
forth
indisputable
facts
and
say
no
these
evidences
indicate
ten
twenty
fifty
thousand
years
ago
etc
there
are
endless
discussions
pro
and
con
bahaullah
sets
aside
these
discussions
by
one
word
and
statement
he
says
the
divine
sovereignty
hath
no
beginning
and
no
ending
by
this
announcement
and
its
demonstration
he
has
established
a
standard
of
agreement
among
those
who
reflect
upon
this
question
of
divine
sovereignty
he
has
brought
reconciliation
and
peace
in
this
war
of
opinion
and
discussion
briefly
there
were
many
universal
cycles
preceding
this
one
in
which
we
are
living
they
were
consummated
completed
and
their
traces
obliterated
the
divine
and
creative
purpose
in
them
was
the
evolution
of
spiritual
man
just
as
it
is
in
this
cycle
the
circle
of
existence
is
the
same
circle
it
returns
the
tree
of
life
has
ever
borne
the
same
heavenly
fruit

notes
by
emma
c
melick
and
howard
macnutt
you
are
very
welcome
very
welcome
all
of
you
in
the
divine
holy
books
there
are
unmistakable
prophecies
giving
the
glad
tidings
of
a
certain
day
in
which
the
promised
one
of
all
the
books
would
appear
a
radiant
dispensation
be
established
the
banner
of
the
most
great
peace
and
conciliation
be
hoisted
and
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
proclaimed
among
the
various
nations
and
peoples
of
the
world
no
enmity
or
hatred
should
remain
all
hearts
were
to
be
connected
one
with
another
these
things
are
recorded
in
the
torah
or
old
testament
in
the
gospel
the
quran
the
zendavesta
the
books
of
buddha
and
the
book
of
confucius
in
brief
all
the
holy
books
contain
these
glad
tidings
they
announce
that
after
the
world
is
surrounded
by
darkness
radiance
shall
appear
for
just
as
the
night
when
it
becomes
excessively
dark
precedes
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
so
likewise
when
the
darkness
of
religious
apathy
and
heedlessness
overtakes
the
world
when
human
souls
become
negligent
of
god
when
materialistic
ideas
overshadow
spirituality
when
nations
become
submerged
in
the
world
of
matter
and
forget
godat
such
a
time
as
this
shall
the
divine
sun
shine
forth
and
the
radiant
morn
appear
consider
to
what
a
remarkable
extent
the
spirituality
of
people
has
been
overcome
by
materialism
so
that
spiritual
susceptibility
seems
to
have
vanished
divine
civilization
become
decadent
and
guidance
and
knowledge
of
god
no
longer
remain
all
are
submerged
in
the
sea
of
materialism
although
some
attend
churches
and
temples
of
worship
and
devotion
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
traditions
and
imitations
of
their
fathers
and
not
for
the
investigation
of
reality
for
it
is
evident
they
have
not
found
reality
and
are
not
engaged
in
its
adoration
they
are
holding
to
certain
imitations
which
have
descended
to
them
from
their
fathers
and
ancestors
they
have
become
accustomed
to
passing
a
certain
length
of
time
in
temple
worship
and
conforming
to
imitations
and
ceremonies
the
proof
of
this
is
that
the
son
of
every
jewish
father
becomes
a
jew
and
not
a
christian
the
son
of
every
muslim
becomes
a
follower
of
islam
the
son
of
every
christian
proves
to
be
a
christian
the
son
of
every
zoroastrian
is
a
zoroastrian
etc
therefore
religious
faith
and
belief
is
merely
a
remnant
of
blind
imitations
which
have
descended
through
fathers
and
ancestors
because
this
mans
father
was
a
jew
he
considers
himself
a
jew
not
that
he
has
investigated
reality
and
proved
satisfactorily
to
himself
that
judaism
is
rightnay
rather
he
is
aware
that
his
forefathers
have
followed
this
course
therefore
he
has
held
to
it
himself
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
explain
that
the
darkness
of
imitations
encompasses
the
world
every
nation
is
holding
to
its
traditional
religious
forms
the
light
of
reality
is
obscured
were
these
various
nations
to
investigate
reality
there
is
no
doubt
they
would
attain
to
it
as
reality
is
one
all
nations
would
then
become
as
one
nation
so
long
as
they
adhere
to
various
imitations
and
are
deprived
of
reality
strife
and
warfare
will
continue
and
rancor
and
sedition
prevail
if
they
investigate
reality
neither
enmity
nor
rancor
will
remain
and
they
will
attain
to
the
utmost
concord
among
themselves
during
the
years
when
the
darkness
of
heedlessness
was
most
intense
in
the
orient
and
the
people
were
so
submerged
in
imitations
that
nations
were
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
each
other
considering
each
other
as
contaminated
and
refusing
to
associateat
such
a
time
as
this
bahaullah
appeared
he
arose
in
the
orient
uprooting
the
very
foundations
of
imitations
and
brought
the
dawn
of
the
light
of
reality
through
him
various
nations
became
united
because
all
desired
reality
inasmuch
as
they
investigated
reality
in
religion
they
found
that
all
men
are
the
servants
of
god
the
posterity
of
adam
children
of
one
household
and
that
the
foundations
of
all
the
prophets
are
one
for
inasmuch
as
the
teachings
of
the
prophets
are
reality
their
foundations
are
one
the
enmity
and
strife
of
nations
therefore
are
due
to
religious
imitations
and
not
to
the
reality
which
underlies
the
teachings
of
the
prophets
through
bahaullah
the
nations
and
peoples
grew
to
understand
and
comprehend
this
therefore
hearts
became
united
and
lives
were
cemented
together
after
centuries
of
hatred
and
bitterness
the
christian
jew
zoroastrian
muslim
and
buddhist
met
in
fellowship
all
of
them
in
the
utmost
love
and
unity
they
became
welded
and
cemented
because
they
had
perceived
reality
the
divine
prophets
are
conjoined
in
the
perfect
state
of
love
each
one
has
given
the
glad
tidings
of
his
successors
coming
and
each
successor
has
sanctioned
the
one
who
preceded
him
they
were
in
the
utmost
unity
but
their
followers
are
in
strife
for
instance
moses
gave
the
message
of
the
glad
tidings
of
christ
and
christ
confirmed
the
prophethood
of
moses
therefore
between
moses
and
jesus
there
is
no
variation
or
conflict
they
are
in
perfect
unity
but
between
the
jew
and
the
christian
there
is
conflict
now
therefore
if
the
christian
and
jewish
peoples
investigate
the
reality
underlying
their
prophets
teachings
they
will
become
kind
in
their
attitude
toward
each
other
and
associate
in
the
utmost
love
for
reality
is
one
and
not
dual
or
multiple
if
this
investigation
of
reality
becomes
universal
the
divergent
nations
will
ratify
all
the
divine
prophets
and
confirm
all
the
holy
books
no
strife
or
rancor
will
then
remain
and
the
world
will
become
united
then
will
we
associate
in
the
reality
of
love
we
will
become
as
fathers
and
sons
as
brothers
and
sisters
living
together
in
complete
unity
love
and
happiness
for
this
century
is
the
century
of
light
it
is
not
like
former
centuries
former
centuries
were
epochs
of
oppression
now
human
intellects
have
developed
and
human
intelligence
has
increased
each
soul
is
investigating
reality
this
is
not
a
time
when
we
shall
wage
war
and
be
hostile
toward
each
other
we
are
living
at
a
time
when
we
should
enjoy
real
friendship
fifty
years
ago
bahaullah
sent
epistles
to
all
the
kings
and
nations
of
the
world
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
mention
of
international
peace
one
of
these
epistles
was
sent
by
him
to
the
president
of
the
american
democracy
in
these
communications
he
summoned
all
to
international
peace
and
the
oneness
of
the
human
world
he
summoned
mankind
to
the
fundamentals
of
the
teachings
of
all
the
prophets
some
of
the
european
kings
were
arrogant
among
them
was
napoleon
iii
bahaullah
wrote
a
second
epistle
to
him
which
was
published
thirty
years
ago
the
context
is
this
o
napoleon
thou
hast
become
haughty
indeed
thou
hast
become
proud
thou
hast
forgotten
god
thou
dost
imagine
that
this
majesty
is
permanent
for
thee
that
this
dominion
is
abiding
for
thee
a
letter
have
we
sent
unto
thee
for
acceptance
with
thy
greatest
love
but
instead
thou
hast
shown
arrogance
therefore
god
shall
uproot
the
edifice
of
thy
sovereignty
thy
country
shall
flee
away
from
thee
thou
shalt
find
humiliation
hastening
after
thee
because
thou
didst
not
arise
for
that
which
was
enjoined
upon
thee
whereas
that
which
was
a
duty
incumbent
upon
thee
was
the
cause
of
life
to
the
world
the
punishment
of
god
shall
soon
be
dealt
out
to
thee
this
epistle
was
revealed
in
the
year
and
after
one
year
the
foundations
of
the
napoleonic
sovereignty
were
completely
uprooted
among
these
epistles
was
a
very
lengthy
one
to
the
shah
of
persia
it
was
printed
and
spread
broadcast
throughout
all
the
countries
this
epistle
was
revealed
in
the
year
in
it
bahaullah
admonished
the
shah
of
persia
to
be
kind
to
all
his
subjects
summoning
him
to
dispense
justice
counseling
him
to
make
no
distinction
between
the
religions
charging
him
to
deal
equally
with
jew
christian
muslim
and
zoroastrian
and
to
remove
the
oppression
prevailing
in
his
country
at
that
time
the
jews
were
greatly
oppressed
in
persia
bahaullah
especially
recommended
justice
for
them
saying
that
all
people
are
the
servants
of
god
and
in
the
eye
of
the
government
they
should
be
equally
estimated
if
justice
is
not
dealt
out
if
these
oppressions
are
not
removed
and
if
thou
dost
not
obey
god
the
foundations
of
thy
government
will
be
razed
and
thou
shalt
become
evanescent
become
as
nothing
thou
shouldst
gather
all
the
learned
men
and
then
summon
me
there
i
shall
be
present
i
will
then
advance
proofs
and
evidences
as
to
my
validity
i
will
manifest
my
proof
and
anything
that
you
may
ask
i
am
ready
but
if
no
attention
is
paid
to
this
book
thou
like
unto
the
kings
who
became
nonexistent
shalt
likewise
become
nonexistent
the
shah
did
not
answer
this
epistle
of
the
blessed
perfection
then
god
destroyed
the
foundations
of
his
sovereignty
among
those
to
whom
bahaullah
wrote
was
the
sultan
of
turkey
in
it
he
arraigned
him
saying
verily
thou
didst
incarcerate
and
make
me
a
prisoner
dost
thou
imagine
that
imprisonment
is
a
loss
to
me
that
imprisonment
is
a
humiliation
for
me
this
imprisonment
is
a
glory
for
me
because
it
is
in
the
pathway
of
god
i
have
not
committed
a
crime
it
is
for
the
sake
of
god
that
i
have
received
this
ordeal
therefore
i
am
very
happy
i
am
exceedingly
joyous
but
thou
must
wait
god
will
send
thee
a
punishment
thou
shalt
receive
retribution
erelong
thou
shalt
observe
how
ordeals
shall
descend
upon
thee
like
rain
and
thou
shalt
become
nonexistent
and
even
so
it
was
likewise
he
sent
messages
to
the
other
kings
and
crowned
heads
of
the
earth
summoning
all
of
them
to
love
equity
international
peace
and
the
oneness
of
humanity
in
order
that
mankind
might
become
unified
and
agreed
that
strife
warfare
and
sedition
should
pass
away
that
bitterness
and
enmity
might
cease
and
all
arise
to
serve
the
one
god
in
brief
two
kings
arose
against
bahaullah
the
shah
of
persia
and
the
sultan
of
turkey
they
imprisoned
him
in
the
fortress
of
akka
in
order
to
extinguish
his
light
and
exterminate
his
cause
but
bahaullah
while
in
prison
wrote
severe
letters
of
arraignment
to
them
he
declared
that
imprisonment
was
no
obstacle
to
him
he
said
this
imprisonment
will
prove
to
be
the
means
of
the
promotion
of
my
cause
this
imprisonment
shall
be
the
incentive
for
the
spreading
of
my
teachings
no
harm
shall
come
to
me
because
i
have
sacrificed
my
life
i
have
sacrificed
my
blood
i
have
sacrificed
my
possessions
i
have
sacrificed
all
and
for
me
this
imprisonment
is
no
loss
and
just
as
he
declared
so
it
came
to
pass
in
prison
he
hoisted
his
banner
and
his
cause
spread
throughout
the
world
it
has
reached
america
now
the
cause
of
bahaullah

the

in

it
is
just
beginning
to

these
two
kings
could
not
do
anything
to
withstand
bahaullah
but
god
through
him
was
capable
of
destroying
both
of
them
i
too
was
in
prison
god
removed
the
chains
from
my
neck
and
placed
them
around
the
neck
of
abdulhamid
it
was

as
it
were
the

hour
that
the
young
turks
declared
liberty
the

set
me
free
they
lifted
the
chains
from
my
neck
and
threw
them
around
the
neck
of
abdulhamid
that
which
he
did
to
me
was
inflicted
upon
him
now
the
position
is
precisely
reversed
his
days
are
spent
in
prison
just
as
i
passed
the
days
in
prison
at
akka
with
this
difference
that
i
was
happy
in
imprisonment
i
was
in
the
utmost
elation
because
i
was
not
a
criminal
they
had
imprisoned
me
in
the
path
of
god
every
time
i
thought
of
this
that
i
was
a
prisoner
in
the
pathway
of
god
the
utmost
elation
overcame
me
abdulhamid
is
now
suffering
punishment
for
his
deeds
because
of
the
sins
he
committed
he
is
now
in
prison
this
is
retribution
for
his
acts
every
hour
he
is
mortified
anew
and
his
ignominy
revived
he
is
in
the
utmost
sorrow
and
disappointment
while
i
am
in
perfect
happiness
i
was
happy
thatpraise
be
to
godi
was
a
prisoner
in
the
cause
of
god
that
my
life
was
not
wasted
that
it
was
spent
in
the
divine
service
nobody
who
saw
me
imagined
that
i
was
in

they
beheld
me
in
the

complete
thankfulness

in
the
world
of
existence
man
has
traversed
successive
degrees
until
he
has
attained
the
human
kingdom
in
each
degree
of
his
progression
he
has
developed
capacity
for
advancement
to
the
next
station
and
condition
while
in
the
kingdom
of
the
mineral
he
was
attaining
the
capacity
for
promotion
into
the
degree
of
the
vegetable
in
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
he
underwent
preparation
for
the
world
of
the
animal
and
from
thence
he
has
come
onward
to
the
human
degree
or
kingdom
throughout
this
journey
of
progression
he
has
ever
and
always
been
potentially
man
in
the
beginning
of
his
human
life
man
was
embryonic
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
there
he
received
capacity
and
endowment
for
the
reality
of
human
existence
the
forces
and
powers
necessary
for
this
world
were
bestowed
upon
him
in
that
limited
condition
in
this
world
he
needed
eyes
he
received
them
potentially
in
the
other
he
needed
ears
he
obtained
them
there
in
readiness
and
preparation
for
his
new
existence
the
powers
requisite
in
this
world
were
conferred
upon
him
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
so
that
when
he
entered
this
realm
of
real
existence
he
not
only
possessed
all
necessary
functions
and
powers
but
found
provision
for
his
material
sustenance
awaiting
him
therefore
in
this
world
he
must
prepare
himself
for
the
life
beyond
that
which
he
needs
in
the
world
of
the
kingdom
must
be
obtained
here
just
as
he
prepared
himself
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
by
acquiring
forces
necessary
in
this
sphere
of
existence
so
likewise
the
indispensable
forces
of
the
divine
existence
must
be
potentially
attained
in
this
world
what
is
he
in
need
of
in
the
kingdom
which
transcends
the
life
and
limitation
of
this
mortal
sphere
that
world
beyond
is
a
world
of
sanctity
and
radiance
therefore
it
is
necessary
that
in
this
world
he
should
acquire
these
divine
attributes
in
that
world
there
is
need
of
spirituality
faith
assurance
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
these
he
must
attain
in
this
world
so
that
after
his
ascension
from
the
earthly
to
the
heavenly
kingdom
he
shall
find
all
that
is
needful
in
that
eternal
life
ready
for
him
that
divine
world
is
manifestly
a
world
of
lights
therefore
man
has
need
of
illumination
here
that
is
a
world
of
love
the
love
of
god
is
essential
it
is
a
world
of
perfections
virtues
or
perfections
must
be
acquired
that
world
is
vivified
by
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
in
this
world
we
must
seek
them
that
is
the
kingdom
of
everlasting
life
it
must
be
attained
during
this
vanishing
existence
by
what
means
can
man
acquire
these
things
how
shall
he
obtain
these
merciful
gifts
and
powers
first
through
the
knowledge
of
god
second
through
the
love
of
god
third
through
faith
fourth
through
philanthropic
deeds
fifth
through
selfsacrifice
sixth
through
severance
from
this
world
seventh
through
sanctity
and
holiness
unless
he
acquires
these
forces
and
attains
to
these
requirements
he
will
surely
be
deprived
of
the
life
that
is
eternal
but
if
he
possesses
the
knowledge
of
god
becomes
ignited
through
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
witnesses
the
great
and
mighty
signs
of
the
kingdom
becomes
the
cause
of
love
among
mankind
and
lives
in
the
utmost
state
of
sanctity
and
holiness
he
shall
surely
attain
to
second
birth
be
baptized
by
the
holy
spirit
and
enjoy
everlasting
existence
is
it
not
astonishing
that
although
man
has
been
created
for
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
for
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
for
spirituality
heavenly
illumination
and
eternal
life
nevertheless
he
continues
ignorant
and
negligent
of
all
this
consider
how
he
seeks
knowledge
of
everything
except
knowledge
of
god
for
instance
his
utmost
desire
is
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
lowest
strata
of
the
earth
day
by
day
he
strives
to
know
what
can
be
found
ten
meters
below
the
surface
what
he
can
discover
within
the
stone
what
he
can
learn
by
archaeological
research
in
the
dust
he
puts
forth
arduous
labors
to
fathom
terrestrial
mysteries
but
is
not
at
all
concerned
about
knowing
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
traversing
the
illimitable
fields
of
the
eternal
world
becoming
informed
of
the
divine
realities
discovering
the
secrets
of
god
attaining
the
knowledge
of
god
witnessing
the
splendors
of
the
sun
of
truth
and
realizing
the
glories
of
everlasting
life
he
is
unmindful
and
thoughtless
of
these
how
much
he
is
attracted
to
the
mysteries
of
matter
and
how
completely
unaware
he
is
of
the
mysteries
of
divinity
nay
he
is
utterly
negligent
and
oblivious
of
the
secrets
of
divinity
how
great
his
ignorance
how
conducive
to
his
degradation
it
is
as
if
a
kind
and
loving
father
had
provided
a
library
of
wonderful
books
for
his
son
in
order
that
he
might
be
informed
of
the
mysteries
of
creation
at
the
same
time
surrounding
him
with
every
means
of
comfort
and
enjoyment
but
the
son
amuses
himself
with
pebbles
and
playthings
neglectful
of
all
his
fathers
gifts
and
provision
how
ignorant
and
heedless
is
man
the
father
has
willed
for
him
eternal
glory
and
he
is
content
with
blindness
and
deprivation
the
father
has
built
for
him
a
royal
palace
but
he
is
playing
with
the
dust
prepared
for
him
garments
of
silk
but
he
prefers
to
remain
unclothed
provided
for
him
delicious
foods
and
fruits
while
he
seeks
sustenance
in

macnutt
today
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
upon
the
subject
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
for
in
this
great
century
the
most
important
accomplishment
is
the
unity
of
mankind
although
in
former
centuries
and
times
this
subject
received
some
measure
of
mention
and
consideration
it
has
now
become
the
paramount
issue
and
question
in
the
religious
and
political
conditions
of
the
world
history
shows
that
throughout
the
past
there
has
been
continual
warfare
and
strife
among
the
various
nations
peoples
and
sects
but
nowpraise
be
to
godin
this
century
of
illumination
hearts
are
inclined
toward
agreement
and
fellowship
and
minds
are
thoughtful
upon
the
question
of
the
unification
of
mankind
there
is
an
emanation
of
the
universal
consciousness
today
which
clearly
indicates
the
dawn
of
a
great
unity
in
the
investigation
of
a
subject
the
right
method
of
approach
is
to
carefully
examine
its
premises
therefore
we
must
go
back
to
the
foundation
upon
which
human
solidarity
restsnamely
that
all
are
the
progeny
of
adam
the
creatures
and
servants
of
one
god
that
god
is
the
protector
and
provider
that
all
are
submerged
in
the
sea
of
divine
mercy
and
grace
and
god
is
loving
toward
all
humanity
shares
in
common
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
faculties
of
a
created
endowment
all
are
equally
subject
to
the
various
exigencies
of
human
life
and
are
similarly
occupied
in
acquiring
the
means
of
earthly
subsistence
from
the
viewpoint
of
creation
human
beings
stand
upon
the
same
footing
in
every
respect
subject
to
the
same
requirements
and
seeking
the
enjoyment
and
comfort
of
earthly
conditions
therefore
the
things
humanity
shares
in
common
are
numerous
and
manifest
this
equal
participation
in
the
physical
intellectual
and
spiritual
problems
of
human
existence
is
a
valid
basis
for
the
unification
of
mankind
consider
how
discord
and
dissension
have
prevailed
in
this
great
human
family
for
thousands
of
years
its
members
have
ever
been
engaged
in
war
and
bloodshed
up
to
the
present
time
in
history
the
world
of
humanity
has
neither
attained
nor
enjoyed
any
measure
of
peace
owing
to
incessant
conditions
of
hostility
and
strife
history
is
a
continuous
and
consecutive
record
of
warfare
brought
about
by
religious
sectarian
racial
patriotic
and
political
causes
the
world
of
humanity
has
found
no
rest
mankind
has
always
been
in
conflict
engaged
in
destroying
the
foundations
pillaging
the
properties
and
possessing
the
lands
and
territory
of
each
other
especially
in
the
earlier
periods
of
savagery
and
barbarism
where
whole
races
and
peoples
were
carried
away
captive
by
their
conquerors
who
shall
measure
or
estimate
the
tremendous
destruction
of
human
life
resulting
from
this
hostility
and
strife
what
human
powers
and
forces
have
been
employed
in
the
prosecution
of
war
and
applied
to
inhuman
purposes
of
battle
and
bloodshed
in
this
most
radiant
century
it
has
become
necessary
to
divert
these
energies
and
utilize
them
in
other
directions
to
seek
the
new
path
of
fellowship
and
unity
to
unlearn
the
science
of
war
and
devote
supreme
human
forces
to
the
blessed
arts
of
peace
after
long
trial
and
experience
we
are
convinced
of
the
harmful
and
satanic
outcomes
of
dissension
now
we
must
seek
after
means
by
which
the
benefits
of
agreement
and
concord
may
be
enjoyed
when
such
means
are
found
we
must
give
them
a
trial
consider
the
harmful
effect
of
discord
and
dissension
in
a
family
then
reflect
upon
the
favors
and
blessings
which
descend
upon
that
family
when
unity
exists
among
its
various
members
what
incalculable
benefits
and
blessings
would
descend
upon
the
great
human
family
if
unity
and
brotherhood
were
established
in
this
century
when
the
beneficent
results
of
unity
and
the
ill
effects
of
discord
are
so
clearly
apparent
the
means
for
the
attainment
and
accomplishment
of
human
fellowship
have
appeared
in
the
world
bahaullah
has
proclaimed
and
provided
the
way
by
which
hostility
and
dissension
may
be
removed
from
the
human
world
he
has
left
no
ground
or
possibility
for
strife
and
disagreement
first
he
has
proclaimed
the
oneness
of
mankind
and
specialized
religious
teachings
for
existing
human
conditions
the
first
form
of
dissension
arises
from
religious
differences
bahaullah
has
given
full
teachings
to
the
world
which
are
conducive
to
fellowship
and
unity
in
religion
throughout
past
centuries
each
system
of
religious
belief
has
boasted
of
its
own
superiority
and
excellence
abasing
and
scorning
the
validity
of
all
others
each
has
proclaimed
its
own
belief
as
the
light
and
all
others
as
darkness
religionists
have
considered
the
world
of
humanity
as
two
trees
one
divine
and
merciful
the
other
satanic
they
themselves
the
branches
leaves
and
fruit
of
the
divine
tree
and
all
others
who
differ
from
them
in
belief
the
product
of
the
tree
which
is
satanic
therefore
sedition
and
warfare
bloodshed
and
strife
have
been
continuous
among
them
the
greatest
cause
of
human
alienation
has
been
religion
because
each
party
has
considered
the
belief
of
the
other
as
anathema
and
deprived
of
the
mercy
of
god
the
teachings
specialized
in
bahaullah
are
addressed
to
humanity
he
says
ye
are
all
the
leaves
of
one
tree
he
does
not
say
ye
are
the
leaves
of
two
trees
one
divine
the
other
satanic
he
has
declared
that
each
individual
member
of
the
human
family
is
a
leaf
or
branch
upon
the
adamic
tree
that
all
are
sheltered
beneath
the
protecting
mercy
and
providence
of
god
that
all
are
the
children
of
god
fruit
upon
the
one
tree
of
his
love
god
is
equally
compassionate
and
kind
to
all
the
leaves
branches
and
fruit
of
this
tree
therefore
there
is
no
satanic
tree
whateversatan
being
a
product
of
human
minds
and
of
instinctive
human
tendencies
toward
error
god
alone
is
creator
and
all
are
creatures
of
his
might
therefore
we
must
love
mankind
as
his
creatures
realizing
that
all
are
growing
upon
the
tree
of
his
mercy
servants
of
his
omnipotent
will
and
manifestations
of
his
good
pleasure
even
though
we
find
a
defective
branch
or
leaf
upon
this
tree
of
humanity
or
an
imperfect
blossom
it
nevertheless
belongs
to
this
tree
and
not
to
another
therefore
it
is
our
duty
to
protect
and
cultivate
this
tree
until
it
reaches
perfection
if
we
examine
its
fruit
and
find
it
imperfect
we
must
strive
to
make
it
perfect
there
are
souls
in
the
human
world
who
are
ignorant
we
must
make
them
knowing
some
growing
upon
the
tree
are
weak
and
ailing
we
must
assist
them
toward
health
and
recovery
if
they
are
as
infants
in
development
we
must
minister
to
them
until
they
attain
maturity
we
should
never
detest
and
shun
them
as
objectionable
and
unworthy
we
must
treat
them
with
honor
respect
and
kindness
for
god
has
created
them
and
not
satan
they
are
not
manifestations
of
the
wrath
of
god
but
evidences
of
his
divine
favor
god
the
creator
has
endowed
them
with
physical
mental
and
spiritual
qualities
that
they
may
seek
to
know
and
do
his
will
therefore
they
are
not
objects
of
his
wrath
and
condemnation
in
brief
all
humanity
must
be
looked
upon
with
love
kindness
and
respect
for
what
we
behold
in
them
are
none
other
than
the
signs
and
traces
of
god
himself
all
are
evidences
of
god
therefore
how
shall
we
be
justified
in
debasing
and
belittling
them
uttering
anathema
and
preventing
them
from
drawing
near
unto
his
mercy
this
is
ignorance
and
injustice
displeasing
to
god
for
in
his
sight
all
are
his
servants
another
cause
of
dissension
and
disagreement
is
the
fact
that
religion
has
been
pronounced
at
variance
with
science
between
scientists
and
the
followers
of
religion
there
has
always
been
controversy
and
strife
for
the
reason
that
the
latter
have
proclaimed
religion
superior
in
authority
to
science
and
considered
scientific
announcement
opposed
to
the
teachings
of
religion
bahaullah
declared
that
religion
is
in
complete
harmony
with
science
and
reason
if
religious
belief
and
doctrine
is
at
variance
with
reason
it
proceeds
from
the
limited
mind
of
man
and
not
from
god
therefore
it
is
unworthy
of
belief
and
not
deserving
of
attention
the
heart
finds
no
rest
in
it
and
real
faith
is
impossible
how
can
man
believe
that
which
he
knows
to
be
opposed
to
reason
is
this
possible
can
the
heart
accept
that
which
reason
denies
reason
is
the
first
faculty
of
man
and
the
religion
of
god
is
in
harmony
with
it
bahaullah
has
removed
this
form
of
dissension
and
discord
from
among
mankind
and
reconciled
science
with
religion
by
revealing
the
pure
teachings
of
the
divine
reality
this
accomplishment
is
specialized
to
him
in
this
day
still
another
cause
of
disagreement
and
dissension
has
been
the
formation
of
religious
sects
and
denominations
bahaullah
said
that
god
has
sent
religion
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
fellowship
among
humankind
and
not
to
create
strife
and
discord
for
all
religion
is
founded
upon
the
love
of
humanity
abraham
promulgated
this
principle
moses
summoned
all
to
its
recognition
christ
established
it
and
muhammad
directed
mankind
to
its
standard
this
is
the
reality
of
religion
if
we
abandon
hearsay
and
investigate
the
reality
and
inner
significance
of
the
heavenly
teachings
we
will
find
the
same
divine
foundation
of
love
for
humanity
the
purport
is
that
religion
is
intended
to
be
the
cause
of
unity
love
and
fellowship
and
not
discord
enmity
and
estrangement
man
has
forsaken
the
foundation
of
divine
religion
and
adhered
to
blind
imitations
each
nation
has
clung
to
its
own
imitations
and
because
these
are
at
variance
warfare
bloodshed
and
destruction
of
the
foundation
of
humanity
have
resulted
true
religion
is
based
upon
love
and
agreement
bahaullah
has
said
if
religion
and
faith
are
the
causes
of
enmity
and
sedition
it
is
far
better
to
be
nonreligious
and
the
absence
of
religion
would
be
preferable
for
we
desire
religion
to
be
the
cause
of
amity
and
fellowship
if
enmity
and
hatred
exist
irreligion
is
preferable
therefore
the
removal
of
this
dissension
has
been
specialized
in
bahaullah
for
religion
is
the
divine
remedy
for
human
antagonism
and
discord
but
when
we
make
the
remedy
the
cause
of
the
disease
it
would
be
better
to
do
without
the
remedy
other
sources
of
human
dissension
are
political
racial
and
patriotic
prejudices
these
have
been
removed
by
bahaullah
he
has
said
and
has
guarded
his
statement
by
rational
proofs
from
the
holy
books
that
the
world
of
humanity
is
one
race
the
surface
of
the
earth
one
place
of
residence
and
that
these
imaginary
racial
barriers
and
political
boundaries
are
without
right
or
foundation
man
is
degraded
in
becoming
the
captive
of
his
own
illusions
and
suppositions
the
earth
is
one
earth
and
the
same
atmosphere
surrounds
it
no
difference
or
preference
has
been
made
by
god
for
its
human
inhabitants
but
man
has
laid
the
foundation
of
prejudice
hatred
and
discord
with
his
fellowman
by
considering
nationalities
separate
in
importance
and
races
different
in
rights
and
privileges
diversity
of
languages
has
been
a
fruitful
cause
of
discord
the
function
of
language
is
to
convey
the
thought
and
purpose
of
one
to
another
therefore
it
matters
not
what
language
man
speaks
or
employs
sixty
years
ago
bahaullah
advocated
one
language
as
the
greatest
means
of
unity
and
the
basis
of
international
conference
he
wrote
to
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
various
nations
recommending
that
one
language
should
be
sanctioned
and
adopted
by
all
governments
according
to
this
each
nation
should
acquire
the
universal
language
in
addition
to
its
native
tongue
the
world
would
then
be
in
close
communication
consultation
would
become
general
and
dissensions
due
to
diversity
of
speech
would
be
removed
another
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
in
relation
to
universal
peace
that
all
mankind
must
be
awakened
to
and
become
conscious
of
the
harm
of
war
that
they
should
be
brought
to
realize
the
benefits
of
peace
and
know
that
peace
is
from
god
while
warfare
is
satanic
man
must
emulate
the
merciful
god
and
turn
away
from
satanic
promptings
in
order
that
universal
inclination
shall
be
toward
peace
love
and
unity
and
the
discord
of
war
vanish
lack
of
equality
between
man
and
woman
is
likewise
a
cause
of
human
dissension
bahaullah
has
named
this
as
an
important
factor
of
discord
and
separation
for
so
long
as
humankind
remains
unequally
divided
in
right
and
importance
between
male
and
female
no
unity
can
be
established
in
a
perfect
human
body
it
is
not
possible
for
one
organ
to
be
complete
and
another
defective
in
the
great
body
of
human
society
it
is
impossible
to
establish
unity
and
coordination
if
one
part
is
considered
perfect
and
the
other
imperfect
when
the
perfect
functions
of
both
parts
are
in
operation
harmony
will
prevail
god
has
created
man
and
woman
equal
as
to
faculties
he
has
made
no
distinction
between
them
woman
has
not
reached
the
level
of
man
in
human
accomplishment
because
of
the
lack
of
opportunity
and
education
if
educational
opportunities
were
made
equal
and
similar
the
two
parts
man
and
woman
would
equalize
in
attainment
god
has
intended
no
difference
between
them
that
should
be
productive
of
discord
he
has
endowed
all
with
human
faculties
and
all
are
manifestations
of
his
mercy
if
we
say
man
and
woman
differ
in
creational
endowment
it
is
contrary
to
divine
justice
and
intention
both
are
human
if
god
has
created
one
perfect
and
the
other
defective
he
is
unjust
but
god
is
just
all
are
perfect
in
his
intention
and
creative
endowment
to
assume
imperfection
in
the
creature
is
to
presuppose
imperfection
in
the
almighty
creator
the
soul
that
excels
in
attainment
of
his
attributes
and
graces
is
most
acceptable
before
god
we
are
considering
the
divine
plan
for
the
reconciliation
of
the
religious
systems
of
the
world
bahaullah
has
said
that
if
one
intelligent
member
be
selected
from
each
of
the
varying
religious
systems
and
these
representatives
come
together
seeking
to
investigate
the
reality
of
religion
they
would
establish
an
interreligious
body
before
which
all
disputes
and
differences
of
belief
could
be
presented
for
consideration
and
settlement
such
questions
could
then
be
weighed
and
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
reality
and
all
imitations
be
discarded
by
this
method
and
procedure
all
sects
denominations
and
systems
would
become
one
do
not
question
the
practicability
of
this
and
be
not
astonished
it
has
been
accomplished
and
effected
in
persia
in
that
country
the
various
religionists
have
conjoined
in
investigating
reality
and
have
united
in
complete
fellowship
and
love
no
traces
of
discord
or
differences
remain
among
them
now
affection
and
unity
are
manifest
instead
they
live
together
in
harmony
and
accord
like
a
single
family
antagonism
and
strife
have
passed
away
love
and
agreement
have
taken
the
place
of
hatred
and
animosity
furthermore
those
souls
who
have
followed
bahaullah
and
attained
this
condition
of
fellowship
and
affiliation
are
muslims
jews
christians
zoroastrians
buddhists
nestorians
sunnites
shiites
and
others
no
discord
exists
among
them
this
is
a
proof
of
the
possibility
of
unification
among
the
religionists
of
the
world
through
practical
means
imitations
and
prejudices
which
have
held
men
apart
have
been
discarded
and
the
reality
of
religion
envelops
them
in
a
perfect
unity
when
reality
envelops
the
soul
of
man
love
is
possible
the
divine
purpose
in
religion
is
pure
love
and
agreement
the
prophets
of
god
manifested
complete
love
for
all
each
one
announced
the
glad
tidings
of
his
successor
and
each
subsequent
one
confirmed
the
teachings
and
prophecies
of
the
prophet
who
preceded
him
there
was
no
disagreement
or
variance
in
the
reality
of
their
teaching
and
mission
discord
has
arisen
among
their
followers
who
have
lost
sight
of
reality
and
hold
fast
to
imitations
if
imitations
be
done
away
with
and
the
radiant
shining
reality
dawn
in
the
souls
of
men
love
and
unity
must
prevail
in
this
way
humanity
will
be
rescued
from
the
strife
and
wars
which
have
prevailed
for
thousands
of
years
dissensions
will
pass
away
and
the
illumination
of
unity
dawn
consider
how
all
the
prophets
of
god
were
persecuted
and
what
hardships
they
experienced
jesus
christ
endured
affliction
and
accepted
martyrdom
upon
the
cross
in
order
to
summon
mankind
to
unity
and
love
what
sacrifice
could
be
greater
he
brought
the
religion
of
love
and
fellowship
into
the
world
shall
we
make
use
of
it
to
create
discord
violence
and
hatred
among
mankind
moses
was
persecuted
and
driven
out
into
the
desert
abraham
was
banished
muhammad
took
refuge
in
caves
the
bab
was
killed
and
bahaullah
was
exiled
and
imprisoned
forty
years
yet
all
of
them
desired
fellowship
and
love
among
men
they
endured
hardships
suffered
persecution
and
death
for
our
sakes
that
we
might
be
taught
to
love
one
another
and
be
united
and
affiliated
instead
of
discordant
and
at
variance
enough
of
these
long
centuries
which
have
brought
such
vicissitudes
and
hardships
into
the
world
through
strife
and
hatred
now
in
this
radiant
century
let
us
try
to
do
the
will
of
god
that
we
may
be
rescued
from
these
things
of
darkness
and
come
forth
into
the
boundless
illumination
of
heaven
shunning
division
and
welcoming
the
divine
oneness
of
humanity
perchance
god
willing
this
terrestrial
world
may
become
as
a
celestial
mirror
upon
which
we
may
behold
the
imprint
of
the
traces
of
divinity
and
the
fundamental
qualities
of
a
new
creation
may
be
reflected
from
the
reality
of
love
shining
in
human
hearts
from
the
light
and
semblance
of
god
in
us
may
it
be
indeed
proved
and
witnessed
that
god
has
created
man
after
his

notes
by
howard
macnutt
i
am
greatly
pleased
to
see
you
your
hearts
are
illumined
by
the
lights
of
baha
this
meeting
is
in
reality
a
divine
celestial
assembly
under
the
favor
of
god
for
we
have
no
other
purpose
than
praising
and
meeting
god
the
prayer
you
have
just
offered
is
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
thankfulness
is
of
various
kinds
there
is
a
verbal
thanksgiving
which
is
confined
to
a
mere
utterance
of
gratitude
this
is
of
no
importance
because
perchance
the
tongue
may
give
thanks
while
the
heart
is
unaware
of
it
many
who
offer
thanks
to
god
are
of
this
type
their
spirits
and
hearts
unconscious
of
thanksgiving
this
is
mere
usage
just
as
when
we
meet
receive
a
gift
and
say
thank
you
speaking
the
words
without
significance
one
may
say
thank
you
a
thousand
times
while
the
heart
remains
thankless
ungrateful
therefore
mere
verbal
thanksgiving
is
without
effect
but
real
thankfulness
is
a
cordial
giving
of
thanks
from
the
heart
when
man
in
response
to
the
favors
of
god
manifests
susceptibilities
of
conscience
the
heart
is
happy
the
spirit
is
exhilarated
these
spiritual
susceptibilities
are
ideal
thanksgiving
there
is
a
cordial
thanksgiving
too
which
expresses
itself
in
the
deeds
and
actions
of
man
when
his
heart
is
filled
with
gratitude
for
example
god
has
conferred
upon
man
the
gift
of
guidance
and
in
thankfulness
for
this
great
gift
certain
deeds
must
emanate
from
him
to
express
his
gratitude
for
the
favors
of
god
man
must
show
forth
praiseworthy
actions
in
response
to
these
bestowals
he
must
render
good
deeds
be
selfsacrificing
loving
the
servants
of
god
forfeiting
even
life
for
them
showing
kindness
to
all
the
creatures
he
must
be
severed
from
the
world
attracted
to
the
kingdom
of
abha
the
face
radiant
the
tongue
eloquent
the
ear
attentive
striving
day
and
night
to
attain
the
good
pleasure
of
god
whatsoever
he
wishes
to
do
must
be
in
harmony
with
the
good
pleasure
of
god
he
must
observe
and
see
what
is
the
will
of
god
and
act
accordingly
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
such
commendable
deeds
are
thankfulness
for
the
favors
of
god
consider
how
grateful
anyone
becomes
when
healed
from
sickness
when
treated
kindly
by
another
or
when
a
service
is
rendered
by
another
even
though
it
may
be
of
the
least
consequence
if
we
forget
such
favors
it
is
an
evidence
of
ingratitude
then
it
will
be
said
a
lovingkindness
has
been
done
but
we
are
thankless
not
appreciating
this
love
and
favor
physically
and
spiritually
we
are
submerged
in
the
sea
of
gods
favor
he
has
provided
our
foods
drink
and
other
requirements
his
favors
encompass
us
from
all
directions
the
sustenances
provided
for
man
are
blessings
sight
hearing
and
all
his
faculties
are
wonderful
gifts
these
blessings
are
innumerable
no
matter
how
many
are
mentioned
they
are
still
endless
spiritual
blessings
are
likewise
endlessspirit
consciousness
thought
memory
perception
ideation
and
other
endowments
by
these
he
has
guided
us
and
we
enter
his
kingdom
he
has
opened
the
doors
of
all
good
before
our
faces
he
has
vouchsafed
eternal
glory
he
has
summoned
us
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
he
has
enriched
us
by
the
bestowals
of
god
every
day
he
has
proclaimed
new
glad
tidings
every
hour
fresh
bounties
descend
consider
how
all
the
people

ye
are
awake
they

notes

the
bahais
must
not
engage
in
political
movements
which
lead
to
sedition
they
must
interest
themselves
in
movements
which
conduce
to
law
and
order
in
persia
at
the
present
time
the
bahais
have
no
part
in
the
revolutionary
upheavals
which
have
terminated
in
lawlessness
and
rebellion
nevertheless
a
bahai
may
hold
a
political
office
and
be
interested
in
politics
of
the
right
type
ministers
state
officials
and
governorgenerals
in
persia
are
bahais
and
there
are
many
other
bahais
holding
governmental
positions
but
nowhere
throughout
the
world
should
the
followers
of
bahaullah
be
engaged
in
seditious
movements
for
example
if
there
should
be
an
uprising
here
in
america
having
for
its
purpose
the
establishment
of
a
despotic
government
the
bahais
should
not
be
connected
with
it
the
bahai
cause
covers
all
economic
and
social
questions
under
the
heading
and
ruling
of
its
laws
the
essence
of
the
bahai
spirit
is
that
in
order
to
establish
a
better
social
order
and
economic
condition
there
must
be
allegiance
to
the
laws
and
principles
of
government
under
the
laws
which
are
to
govern
the
world
the
socialists
may
justly
demand
human
rights
but
without
resort
to
force
and
violence
the
governments
will
enact
these
laws
establishing
just
legislation
and
economics
in
order
that
all
humanity
may
enjoy
a
full
measure
of
welfare
and
privilege
but
this
will
always
be
according
to
legal
protection
and
procedure
without
legislative
administration
rights
and
demands
fail
and
the
welfare
of
the
commonwealth
cannot
be
realized
today
the
method
of
demand
is
the
strike
and
resort
to
force
which
is
manifestly
wrong
and
destructive
of
human
foundations
rightful
privilege
and
demand
must
be
set
forth
in
laws
and
regulations
while
thousands
are
considering
these
questions
we
have
more
essential
purposes
the
fundamentals
of
the
whole
economic
condition
are
divine
in
nature
and
are
associated
with
the
world
of
the
heart
and
spirit
this
is
fully
explained
in
the
bahai
teaching
and
without
knowledge
of
its
principles
no
improvement
in
the
economic
state
can
be
realized
the
bahais
will
bring
about
this
improvement
and
betterment
but
not
through
sedition
and
appeal
to
physical
forcenot
through
warfare
but
welfare
hearts
must
be
so
cemented
together
love
must
become
so
dominant
that
the
rich
shall
most
willingly
extend
assistance
to
the
poor
and
take
steps
to
establish
these
economic
adjustments
permanently
if
it
is
accomplished
in
this
way
it
will
be
most
praiseworthy
because
then
it
will
be
for
the
sake
of
god
and
in
the
pathway
of
his
service
for
example
it
will
be
as
if
the
rich
inhabitants
of
a
city
should
say
it
is
neither
just
nor
lawful
that
we
should
possess
great
wealth
while
there
is
abject
poverty
in
this
community
and
then
willingly
give
their
wealth
to
the
poor
retaining
only
as
much
as
will
enable
them
to
live
comfortably
strive
therefore
to
create
love
in
the
hearts
in
order
that
they
may
become
glowing
and
radiant
when
that
love
is
shining
it
will
permeate
other
hearts
even
as
this
electric
light
illumines
its
surroundings
when
the
love
of
god
is
established
everything
else
will
be
realized
this
is
the
true
foundation
of
all
economics
reflect
upon
it
endeavor
to
become
the
cause
of
the
attraction
of
souls
rather
than
to
enforce
minds
manifest
true
economics
to
the
people
show
what
love
is
what
kindness
is
what
true
severance
is
and
generosity
this
is
the
important
thing
for
you
to
do
act
in
accordance
with
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
all
his
books
will
be
translated
now
is
the
time
for
you
to
live
in
accordance
with
his
words
let
your
deeds
be
the
real
translation
of
their
meaning
economic
questions
will
not
attract
hearts
the
love
of
god
alone
will
attract
them
economic
questions
are
most
interesting
but
the
power
which
moves
controls
and
attracts
the
hearts
of
men
is
the
love
of
god

notes
by

mckinney
in
the
world
of
existence
there
is
nothing
so
important
as
spirit
nothing
so
essential
as
the
spirit
of
man
the
spirit
of
man
is
the
most
noble
of
phenomena
the
spirit
of
man
is
the
meeting
between
man
and
god
the
spirit
of
man
is
the
animus
of
human
life
and
the
collective
center
of
all
human
virtues
the
spirit
of
man
is
the
cause
of
the
illumination
of
this
world
the
world
may
be
likened
to
the
body
man
is
the
spirit
of
the
body
because
the
light
of
the
world
is
the
human
spirit
man
is
the
life
of
the
world
and
the
life
of
man
is
the
spirit
the
happiness
of
the
world
depends
upon
man
and
the
happiness
of
man
is
dependent
upon
the
spirit
the
world
may
be
likened
to
the
lamp
chimney
whereas
man
is
the
light
man
himself
may
be
likened
to
the
lamp
his
spirit
is
the
light
within
the
lamp
therefore
we
will
speak
of
this
spirit
the
philosophers
of
the
world
are
divided
into
two
classes
materialists
who
deny
the
spirit
and
its
immortality
and
the
divine
philosophers
the
wise
men
of
god
the
true
illuminati
who
believe
in
the
spirit
and
its
continuance
hereafter
the
ancient
philosophers
taught
that
man
consists
simply
of
the
material
elements
which
compose
his
cellular
structure
and
that
when
this
composition
is
disintegrated
the
life
of
man
becomes
extinct
they
reasoned
that
man
is
body
only
and
from
this
elemental
composition
the
organs
and
their
functions
the
senses
powers
and
attributes
which
characterize
man
have
proceeded
and
that
these
disappear
completely
with
the
physical
body
this
is
practically
the
statement
of
all
the
materialists
the
divine
philosophers
proclaim
that
the
spirit
of
man
is
everliving
and
eternal
and
because
of
the
objections
of
the
materialists
these
wise
men
of
god
have
advanced
rational
proofs
to
support
the
validity
of
their
statement
inasmuch
as
the
materialistic
philosophers
deny
the
books
of
god
scriptural
demonstration
is
not
evidence
to
them
and
materialistic
proofs
are
necessary
answering
them
the
men
of
divine
knowledge
have
said
that
all
existing
phenomena
may
be
resolved
into
grades
or
kingdoms
classified
progressively
as
mineral
vegetable
animal
and
human
each
of
which
possesses
its
degree
of
function
and
intelligence
when
we
consider
the
mineral
we
find
that
it
exists
and
is
possessed
of
the
power
of
affinity
or
combination
the
vegetable
possesses
the
qualities
of
the
mineral
plus
the
augmentative
virtue
or
power
of
growth
it
is
therefore
evident
that
the
vegetable
kingdom
is
superior
to
the
mineral
the
animal
kingdom
in
turn
possesses
the
qualities
of
the
mineral
and
vegetable
plus
the
five
senses
of
perception
whereof
the
kingdoms
below
it
are
lacking
likewise
the
power
of
memory
inherent
in
the
animal
does
not
exist
in
the
lower
kingdoms
just
as
the
animal
is
more
noble
than
the
vegetable
and
mineral
so
man
is
superior
to
the
animal
the
animal
is
bereft
of
idealitythat
is
to
say
it
is
a
captive
of
the
world
of
nature
and
not
in
touch
with
that
which
lies
within
and
beyond
nature
it
is
without
spiritual
susceptibilities
deprived
of
the
attractions
of
consciousness
unconscious
of
the
world
of
god
and
incapable
of
deviating
from
the
law
of
nature
it
is
different
with
man
man
is
possessed
of
the
emanations
of
consciousness
he
has
perception
ideality
and
is
capable
of
discovering
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
all
the
industries
inventions
and
facilities
surrounding
our
daily
life
were
at
one
time
hidden
secrets
of
nature
but
the
reality
of
man
penetrated
them
and
made
them
subject
to
his
purposes
according
to
natures
laws
they
should
have
remained
latent
and
hidden
but
man
having
transcended
those
laws
discovered
these
mysteries
and
brought
them
out
of
the
plane
of
the
invisible
into
the
realm
of
the
known
and
visible
how
wonderful
is
the
spirit
of
man
one
of
the
mysteries
of
natural
phenomena
is
electricity
man
has
discovered
this
illimitable
power
and
made
it
captive
to
his
uses
how
many
of
natures
secrets
have
been
penetrated
and
revealed
columbus
while
in
spain
discovered
america
man
has
accurately
determined
that
the
sun
is
stationary
while
the
earth
revolves
about
it
the
animal
cannot
do
this
man
perceives
the
mirage
to
be
an
illusion
this
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
animal
the
animal
can
only
know
through
sense
impressions
and
cannot
grasp
intellectual
realities
the
animal
cannot
conceive
of
the
power
of
thought
this
is
an
abstract
intellectual
matter
and
not
limited
to
the
senses
the
animal
is
incapable
of
knowing
that
the
earth
is
round
in
brief
abstract
intellectual
phenomena
are
human
powers
all
creation
below
the
kingdom
of
man
is
the
captive
of
nature
it
cannot
deviate
in
the
slightest
degree
from
natures
laws
but
man
wrests
the
sword
of
dominion
from
natures
hand
and
uses
it
upon
natures
head
for
example
it
is
a
natural
exigency
that
man
should
be
a
dweller
upon
the
earth
but
the
power
of
the
human
spirit
transcends
this
limitation
and
he
soars
aloft
in
airplanes
this
is
contrary
to
the
law
and
requirement
of
nature
he
sails
at
high
speed
upon
the
ocean
and
dives
beneath
its
surface
in
submarines
he
imprisons
the
human
voice
in
a
phonograph
and
communicates
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
from
east
to
west
these
are
things
we
know
to
be
contrary
to
the
limitations
of
natural
law
man
transcends
nature
while
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
are
helplessly
subject
to
it
this
can
be
done
only
through
the
power
of
the
spirit
because
the
spirit
is
the
reality
in
the
physical
powers
and
senses
however
man
and
the
animal
are
partners
in
fact
the
animal
is
often
superior
to
man
in
sense
perception
for
instance
the
vision
of
some
animals
is
exceedingly
keen
and
the
hearing
of
others
most
acute
consider
the
instinct
of
a
dog
how
much
greater
than
that
of
man
but
although
the
animal
shares
with
man
all
the
physical
virtues
and
senses
a
spiritual
power
has
been
bestowed
upon
man
of
which
the
animal
is
devoid
this
is
a
proof
that
there
is
something
in
man
above
and
beyond
the
endowment
of
the
animala
faculty
and
virtue
peculiar
to
the
human
kingdom
which
is
lacking
in
the
lower
kingdoms
of
existence
this
is
the
spirit
of
man
all
these
wonderful
human
accomplishments
are
due
to
the
efficacy
and
penetrating
power
of
the
spirit
of
man
if
man
were
bereft
of
this
spirit
none
of
these
accomplishments
would
have
been
possible
this
is
as
evident
as
the
sun
at
midday
all
the
organisms
of
material
creation
are
limited
to
an
image
or
form
that
is
to
say
each
created
material
being
is
possessed
of
a
form
it
cannot
possess
two
forms
at
the
same
time
for
example
a
body
may
be
spherical
triangular
or
square
but
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
be
two
of
these
shapes
simultaneously
it
may
be
triangular
but
if
it
is
to
become
square
it
must
first
rid
itself
of
the
triangular
shape
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
it
to
be
both
at
the
same
time
therefore
it
is
evident
in
the
reality
of
material
organisms
that
different
forms
cannot
be
simultaneously
possessed
in
the
spiritual
reality
of
man
however
all
geometrical
figures
can
be
simultaneously
conceived
while
in
physical
realities
one
image
must
be
forsaken
in
order
that
another
may
be
possible
this
is
the
law
of
change
and
transformation
and
change
and
transformation
are
precursors
of
mortality
were
it
not
for
this
change
in
form
phenomena
would
be
immortal
but
because
the
phenomenal
existence
is
subject
to
transformation
it
is
mortal
the
reality
of
man
however
is
possessed
of
all
virtues
it
is
not
necessary
for
him
to
give
up
one
image
for
another
as
mere
physical
bodies
do
therefore
in
that
reality
there
is
no
change
or
transformation
it
is
immortal
and
everlasting
the
body
of
man
may
be
in
america
while
his
spirit
is
laboring
and
working
in
the
far
east
discovering
organizing
and
planning
while
occupied
in
governing
making
laws
and
erecting
a
building
in
russia
his
body
is
still
here
in
america
what
is
this
power
which
notwithstanding
that
it
is
embodied
in
america
is
operating
at
the
same
time
in
the
orient
organizing
destroying
upbuilding
it
is
the
spirit
of
man
this
is
irrefutable
when
you
wish
to
reflect
upon
or
consider
a
matter
you
consult
something
within
you
you
say
shall
i
do
it
or
shall
i
not
do
it
is
it
better
to
make
this
journey
or
abandon
it
whom
do
you
consult
who
is
within
you
deciding
this
question
surely
there
is
a
distinct
power
an
intelligent
ego
were
it
not
distinct
from
your
ego
you
would
not
be
consulting
it
it
is
greater
than
the
faculty
of
thought
it
is
your
spirit
which
teaches
you
which
advises
and
decides
upon
matters
who
is
it
that
interrogates
who
is
it
that
answers
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
spirit
and
that
there
is
no
change
or
transformation
in
it
for
it
is
not
a
composition
of
elements
and
anything
that
is
not
composed
of
elements
is
eternal
change
and
transformation
are
peculiarities
of
composition
there
is
no
change
and
transformation
in
the
spirit
in
proof
of
this
the
body
may
become
weakened
in
its
members
it
may
be
dismembered
or
one
of
its
members
may
be
incapacitated
the
whole
body
may
be
paralyzed
and
yet
the
mind
the
spirit
remains
ever
the
same
the
mind
decides
the
thought
is
perfect
and
yet
the
hand
is
withered
the
feet
have
become
useless
the
spinal
column
is
paralyzed
and
there
is
no
muscular
movement
at
all
but
the
spirit
is
in
the
same
status
dismember
a
healthy
man
the
spirit
is
not
dismembered
amputate
his
feet
his
spirit
is
there
he
may
become
lame
the
spirit
is
not
affected
the
spirit
is
ever
the
same
no
change
or
transformation
can
you
perceive
and
because
there
is
no
change
or
transformation
it
is
everlasting
and
permanent
consider
man
while
in
the
state
of
sleep
it
is
evident
that
all
his
parts
and
members
are
at
a
standstill
are
functionless
his
eye
does
not
see
his
ear
does
not
hear
his
feet
and
hands
are
motionless
but
nevertheless
he
does
see
in
the
world
of
dreams
he
does
hear
he
speaks
he
walks
he
may
even
fly
in
an
airplane
therefore
it
becomes
evident
that
though
the
body
be
dead
yet
the
spirit
is
alive
and
permanent
nay
the
perceptions
may
be
keener
when
mans
body
is
asleep
the
flight
may
be
higher
the
hearing
may
be
more
acute
all
the
functions
are
there
and
yet
the
body
is
at
a
standstill
hence
it
is
proof
that
there
is
a
spirit
in
the
man
and
in
this
spirit
there
is
no
distinction
as
to
whether
the
body
be
asleep
or
absolutely
dead
and
dependent
the
spirit
is
not
incapacitated
by
these
conditions
it
is
not
bereft
of
its
existence
it
is
not
bereft
of
its
perfections
the
proofs
are
many
innumerable
these
are
all
rational
proofs
nobody
can
refute
them
as
we
have
shown
that
there
is
a
spirit
and
that
this
spirit
is
permanent
and
everlasting
we
must
strive
to
learn
of
it
may
you
become
informed
of
its
power
hasten
to
render
it
divine
to
have
it
become
sanctified
and
holy

make

notes

mckinney
i
am
very
happy
to
greet
you
here
today
this
is
the
second
time
the
breeze
of
god
has
wafted
over
boston
i
am
expecting
results
from
this
visit
and
hope
that
my
coming
may
not
be
fruitless
the
results
i
expect
are
these
that
the
individual
soul
shall
be
released
from
self
and
desire
and
freed
from
the
bondage
of
satanic
suggestions
may
the
mirrors
of
hearts
be
cleansed
from
dust
in
order
that
the
sun
of
truth
may
be
reflected
therein
man
possesses
two
kinds
of
susceptibilities
the
natural
emotions
which
are
like
dust
upon
the
mirror
and
spiritual
susceptibilities
which
are
merciful
and
heavenly
characteristics
there
is
a
power
which
purifies
the
mirror
from
dust
and
transforms
its
reflection
into
intense
brilliancy
and
radiance
so
that
spiritual
susceptibilities
may
chasten
the
hearts
and
heavenly
bestowals
sanctify
them
what
is
the
dust
which
obscures
the
mirror
it
is
attachment
to
the
world
avarice
envy
love
of
luxury
and
comfort
haughtiness
and
selfdesire
this
is
the
dust
which
prevents
reflection
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
in
the
mirror
the
natural
emotions
are
blameworthy
and
are
like
rust
which
deprives
the
heart
of
the
bounties
of
god
but
sincerity
justice
humility
severance
and
love
for
the
believers
of
god
will
purify
the
mirror
and
make
it
radiant
with
reflected
rays
from
the
sun
of
truth
it
is
my
hope
that
you
may
consider
this
matter
that
you
may
search
out
your
own
imperfections
and
not
think
of
the
imperfections
of
anybody
else
strive
with
all
your
power
to
be
free
from
imperfections
heedless
souls
are
always
seeking
faults
in
others
what
can
the
hypocrite
know
of
others
faults
when
he
is
blind
to
his
own
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
words
in
the
seven
valleys
it
is
a
guide
for
human
conduct
as
long
as
a
man
does
not
find
his
own
faults
he
can
never
become
perfect
nothing
is
more
fruitful
for
man
than
the
knowledge
of
his
own
shortcomings
the
blessed
perfection
says
i
wonder
at
the
man
who
does
not
find
his
own
imperfections

august
talk

dublin

dublin
new
hampshire
notes
by
howard
macnutt
the
people
of
christianity
have
clung
to
literal
interpretation
of
the
statement
in
the
gospel
that
christ
came
from
heaven
the
jews
likewise
at
the
time
of
his
manifestation
held
to
outward
and
visible
expectation
of
the
fulfillment
of
the
prophecies
they
said
the
messiah
shall
appear
from
heaven
this
man
came
from
nazareth
we
know
his
house
we
know
his
parents
and
people
it
is
only
hearsay
that
he
descended
from
heaven
this
cannot
be
proved
the
text
of
the
gospel
states
that
he
came
from
heaven
although
physically
born
of
the
mother
the
meaning
is
that
the
divine
reality
of
christ
was
from
heaven
but
the
body
was
born
of
mary
therefore
he
came
according
to
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
book
and
likewise
according
to
natural
lawhis
reality
from
heaven
his
body
earthly
as
he
came
before
so
must
he
come
this
time
in
the
same
way
but
some
arise
with
objections
saying
we
must
have
literal
proof
of
this
through
the
senses
the
reality
of
christ
was
always
in
heaven
and
will
always
be
this
is
the
intention
of
the
text
of
the
gospel
for
while
jesus
christ
walked
upon
the
earth
he
said
the
son
of
man
is
in
heaven
therefore
holding
to
literal
interpretation
and
visible
fulfillment
of
the
text
of
the
holy
books
is
simply
imitation
of
ancestral
forms
and
beliefs
for
when
we
perceive
the
reality
of
christ
these
texts
and
statements
become
clear
and
perfectly
reconcilable
with
each
other
unless
we
perceive
reality
we
cannot
understand
the
meanings
of
the
holy
books
for
these
meanings
are
symbolical
and
spiritualsuch
as
for
instance
the
raising
of
lazarus
which
has
spiritual
interpretation
we
must
first
establish
the
fact
that
the
power
of
god
is
infinite
unlimited
and
that
it
is
within
that
power
to
accomplish
anything
second
we
must
understand
the
interpretation
of
christs
words
concerning
the
dead
a
certain
disciple
came
to
christ
and
asked
permission
to
go
and
bury
his
father
he
answered
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
therefore
christ
designated
as
dead
some
who
were
still
livingthat
is
let
the
living
dead
the
spiritually
dead
bury
your
father
they
were
dead
because
they
were
not
believers
in
christ
although
physically
alive
they
were
dead
spiritually
this
is
the
meaning
of
christs
words
that
which
is
born
of
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
spirit
is
spirit
he
meant
that
those
who
were
simply
born
of
the
human
body
were
dead
spiritually
while
those
quickened
by
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
were
living
and
eternally
alive
these
are
the
interpretations
of
christ
himself
reflect
upon
them
and
the
meanings
of
the
holy
books
will
become
clear
as
the
sun
at
midday
the
holy
books
have
their
special
terminologies
which
must
be
known
and
understood
physicians
have
their
own
peculiar
terms
architects
philosophers
have
their
characteristic
expressions
poets
have
their
phrases
and
scientists
their
nomenclature
in
the
scripture
we
read
that
zion
is
dancing
it
is
evident
that
this
has
other
than
literal
interpretation
the
meaning
is
that
the
people
of
zion
shall
rejoice
the
jews
said
christ
was
not
the
messiah
but
antichrist
because
one
of
the
signs
of
the
messiahs
coming
was
the
dancing
of
mount
zion
which
had
not
yet
come
to
pass
in
reality
when
christ
appeared
not
only
mount
zion
but
all
palestine
danced
and
rejoiced
again
in
scriptures
it
is
said
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
clap
their
hands
this
is
symbolical
there
are
terms
and
expressions
of
usage
in
every
language
which
cannot
be
taken
literally
for
instance
in
oriental
countries
it
is
customary
to
say
when
my
friend
entered
the
house
the
doors
and
walls
began
to
sing
and
dance
in
persia
they
say
get
at
the
head
meaning
engage
in
the
matter
according
to
its
own
terms
and
usages
all
these
have
other
and
inner
meanings
you
have
asked
concerning
approval
of
christian
science
treatment
and
healing
spirit
has
influence
prayer
has
spiritual
effect
therefore
we
pray
o
god
heal
this
sick
one
perchance
god
will
answer
does
it
matter
who
prays
god
will
answer
the
prayer
of
every
servant
if
that
prayer
is
urgent
his
mercy
is
vast
illimitable
he
answers
the
prayers
of
all
his
servants
he
answers
the
prayer
of
this
plant
the
plant
prays
potentially
o
god
send
me
rain
god
answers
the
prayer
and
the
plant
grows
god
will
answer
anyone
he
answers
prayers
potentially
before
we
were
born
into
this
world
did
we
not
pray
o
god
give
me
a
mother
give
me
two
fountains
of
bright
milk
purify
the
air
for
my
breathing
grant
me
rest
and
comfort
prepare
food
for
my
sustenance
and
living
did
we
not
pray
potentially
for
these
needed
blessings
before
we
were
created
when
we
came
into
this
world
did
we
not
find
our
prayers
answered
did
we
not
find
mother
father
food
light
home
and
every
other
necessity
and
blessing
although
we
did
not
actually
ask
for
them
therefore
it
is
natural
that
god
will
give
to
us
when
we
ask
him
his
mercy
is
allencircling
but
we
ask
for
things
which
the
divine
wisdom
does
not
desire
for
us
and
there
is
no
answer
to
our
prayer
his
wisdom
does
not
sanction
what
we
wish
we
pray
o
god
make
me
wealthy
if
this
prayer
were
universally
answered
human
affairs
would
be
at
a
standstill
there
would
be
none
left
to
work
in
the
streets
none
to
till
the
soil
none
to
build
none
to
run
the
trains
therefore
it
is
evident
that
it
would
not
be
well
for
us
if
all
prayers
were
answered
the
affairs
of
the
world
would
be
interfered
with
energies
crippled
and
progress
hindered
but
whatever
we
ask
for
which
is
in
accord
with
divine
wisdom
god
will
answer
assuredly
for
instance
a
very
feeble
patient
may
ask
the
doctor
to
give
him
food
which
would
be
positively
dangerous
to
his
life
and
condition
he
may
beg
for
roast
meat
the
doctor
is
kind
and
wise
he
knows
it
would
be
dangerous
to
his
patient
so
he
refuses
to
allow
it
the
doctor
is
merciful
the
patient
ignorant
through
the
doctors
kindness
the
patient
recovers
his
life
is
saved
yet
the
patient
may
cry
out
that
the
doctor
is
unkind
not
good
because
he
refuses
to
answer
his
pleading
god
is
merciful
in
his
mercy
he
answers
the
prayers
of
all
his
servants
when
according
to
his
supreme
wisdom
it
is
necessary
august
talk

dublin
new
hampshire
notes
by
howard
macnutt
today
we
are
enjoying
temperate
weather
as
there
are
many
strangers
present
we
will
answer
questions
question
are
not
all
christians
bahais
is
there
any
difference
answer
when
christians
act
according
to
the
teachings
of
christ
they
are
called
bahais
for
the
foundations
of
christianity
and
the
religion
of
bahaullah
are
one
the
foundations
of
all
the
divine
prophets
and
holy
books
are
one
the
difference
among
them
is
one
of
terminology
only
each
springtime
is
identical
with
the
former
springtime
the
distinction
between
them
is
only
one
of
the
calendar
and
so
on
the
difference
between
a
christian
and
a
bahai
therefore
is
this
there
was
a
former
springtime
and
there
is
a
springtime
now
no
other
difference
exists
because
the
foundations
are
the
same
whoever
acts
completely
in
accordance
with
the
teachings
of
christ
is
a
bahai
the
purpose
is
the
essential
meaning
of
christian
not
the
mere
word
the
purpose
is
the
sun
itself
and
not
the
dawning
points
for
though
the
sun
is
one
sun
its
dawning
points
are
many
we
must
not
adore
the
dawning
points
but
worship
the
sun
we
must
adore
the
reality
of
religion
and
not
blindly
cling
to
the
appellation
christianity
the
sun
of
reality
must
be
worshiped
and
followed
we
must
seek
the
fragrance
of
the
rose
from
whatever
bush
it
is
bloomingwhether
oriental
or
western
be
seekers
of
light
no
matter
from
which
lantern
it
shines
forth
be
not
lovers
of
the
lantern
at
one
time
the
light
has
shone
from
a
lantern
in
the
east
now
in
the
west
if
it
comes
from
north
south
from
whatever
direction
it
proceeds
follow
the
light
let
me
illustrate
further
a
certain
person
bestowed
a
coin
upon
five
beggars
they
resolved
to
spend
it
for
food
the
englishman
said
buy
grapes
the
turk
wanted
uzum
the
arab
anab
the
greek
stafili
the
persian
angur
not
understanding
each
others
language
they
quarreled
and
fought
a
stranger
came
along
he
was
familiar
with
all
five
languages
he
said
give
me
the
coin
i
will
buy
what
you
wish
when
he
brought
them
grapes
they
were
all
satisfied
they
wanted
the
same
thing
but
differed
in
the
term
only
briefly
when
reality
dawns
in
the
midst
of
the
religions
all
will
be
unified
and
reconciled
question
does
abdulbaha
find
christianity
is
not
lived
up
to
and
carried
out
in
america
answer
my
meaning
is
that
it
should
be
completely
carried
out
and
lived
up
to
man
needs
eyes
ears
arms
a
head
feet
and
various
other
members
when
he
possesses
all
and
all
work
together
there
is
symmetry
and
perfection
in
him
so
christ
said
be
ye
therefore
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
meaning
that
perfection
is
the
requirement
of
christianity
be
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
this
is
not
easy
it
necessitates
the
focalization
of
all
heavenly
virtues
it
requires
that
we
become
recipients
of
all
the
perfections
of
god
then
we
become
his
image
and
likeness
for
in
the
bible
it
is
stated
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
the
attainment
of
this
is
most
difficult
when
christ
appeared
with
those
marvelous
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
the
children
of
israel
said
we
are
quite
independent
of
him
we
can
do
without
him
and
follow
moses
we
have
a
book
and
in
it
are
found
the
teachings
of
god
what
need
therefore
have
we
of
this
man
christ
said
to
them
the
book
sufficeth
you
not
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
hold
to
a
book
of
medicine
and
say
i
have
no
need
of
a
doctor
i
will
act
according
to
the
book
in
it
every
disease
is
named
all
symptoms
are
explained
the
diagnosis
of
each
ailment
is
completely
written
out
and
a
prescription
for
each
malady
is
furnished
therefore
why
do
i
need
a
doctor
this
is
sheer
ignorance
a
physician
is
needed
to
prescribe
through
his
skill
the
principles
of
the
book
are
correctly
and
effectively
applied
until
the
patient
is
restored
to
health
christ
was
a
heavenly
physician
he
brought
spiritual
health
and
healing
into
the
world
bahaullah
is
likewise
a
divine
physician
he
has
revealed
prescriptions
for
removing
disease
from
the
body
politic
and
has
remedied
human
conditions
by
spiritual
power
therefore
mere
knowledge
is
not
sufficient
for
complete
human
attainment
the
teachings
of
the
holy
books
need
a
heavenly
power
and
divine
potency
to
carry
them
out
a
house
is
not
built
by
mere
acquaintance
with
the
plans
money
must
be
forthcoming
volition
is
necessary
to
construct
it
a
carpenter
must
be
employed
in
its
erection
it
is
not
enough
to
say
the
plan
and
purpose
of
this
house
are
very
good
i
will
live
in
it
there
are
no
walls
of
protection
there
is
no
roof
of
shelter
in
this
mere
statement
the
house
must
be
actually
built
before
we
can
live
in
it
briefly
the
teachings
of
the
holy
books
need
a
divine
potency
to
complete
their
accomplishment
in
human
hearts
in
persia
bahaullah
reared
and
taught
souls
established
a
bond
of
affiliation
among
various
peoples
and
united
divergent
religious
beliefs
to
such
an
extent
that
twenty
thousand
devoted
ones
sacrificed
themselves
for
the
cause
of
god
in
the
glorious
unity
of
martyrdom
no
differences
whatever
remained
among
these
blessed
soulschristians
jews
muslims
zoroastrians
all
blended
unified
and
agreed
through
the
potency
of
his
heavenly
power
not
by
mere
words
not
by
merely
saying
unity
is
good
and
love
is
praiseworthy
bahaullah
not
only
proclaimed
this
unity
and
love
he
established
it
as
a
heavenly
physician
he
not
only
gave
prescriptions
for
these
ailments
of
discord
and
hatred
but
accomplished
the
actual
healing
we
may
read
in
a
medical
book
that
a
certain
form
of
illness
requires
such
and
such
a
remedy
while
this
may
be
absolutely
true
the
remedy
is
useless
unless
there
be
volition
and
executive
force
to
apply
it
every
man
in
the
kings
army
can
give
a
command
but
when
the
king
speaks
it
is
carried
out
this
one
that
one
may
say
go
conquer
a
country
but
when
the
king
says
go
the
army
advances
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
confirmation
of
the
holy
spirit
and
impelling
influence
of
a
heavenly
power
are
needed
to
accomplish
the
divine
purpose
in
human
hearts
and
conditions
jesus
christ
single
solitary
and
alone
accomplished
what
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
could
not
have
carried
out
if
all
the
kingdoms
and
nations
of
the
world
had
combined
to
effect
it
they
would
have
failed
it
is
therefore
evident
and
proved
that
an
effort
must
be
put
forward
to
complete
the
purpose
and
plan
of
the
teachings
of
god
in
order
that
in
this
great
day
of
days
the
world
may
be
reformed

this

this

mere

many
years
ago
in
baghdad
i
saw
a
certain
officer
sitting
upon
the
ground
before
him
a
large
paper
was
placed
into
which
he
was
sticking
needles
tipped
with
small
red
and
white
flags
first
he
would
stick
them
into
the
paper
then
thoughtfully
pull
them
out
and
change
their
position
i
watched
him
with
curious
interest
for
a
long
time
then
asked
what
are
you
doing
he
replied
i
have
in
mind
something
which
is
historically
related
of
napoleon
i
during
his
war
against
austria
one
day
it
is
said
his
secretary
found
him
sitting
upon
the
ground
as
i
am
now
doing
sticking
needles
into
a
paper
before
him
his
secretary
inquired
what
it
meant
napoleon
answered
i
am
on
the
battlefield
figuring
out
my
next
victory
you
see
italy
and
austria
are
defeated
and
france
is
triumphant
in
the
great
campaign
which
followed
everything
came
out
just
as
he
said
his
army
carried
his
plans
to
a
complete
success
now
i
am
doing
the
same
as
napoleon
figuring
out
a
great
campaign
of
military
conquest
i
said
where
is
your
army
napoleon
had
an
army
already
equipped
when
he
figured
out
his
victory
you
have
no
army
your
forces
exist
only
on
paper
you
have
no
power
to
conquer
countries
first
get
ready
your
army
then
sit
upon
the
ground
with
your
needles
we
need
an
army
to
attain
victory
in
the
spiritual
world
mere
plans
are
not
sufficient
ideas
and
principles
are
helpless
without
a
divine
power
to
put
them
into
effect
aside
from
all
this
there
is
need
of
the
stimulus
of
the
joy
of
glad
tidings
in
human
hearts
certain
spiritual
attraction
is
requisite
in
order
that
hearts
may
willingly
take
the
step
forward
in
the
divine
cause
we
must
become
attracted
to
god
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
must
take
effect
unless
this
is
so
it
is
impossible
for
the
teachings
of
god
to
accomplish
in
us
an
ideal
power
is
necessary
the
people
of
america
have
remarkably
quick
perception
intelligence
and
understanding
their
thoughts
are
free
and
not
fettered
by
the
yoke
of
governmental
tyranny
they
should
investigate
reality
and
not
be
occupied
with
ancestral
forms
and
imitations
consider
what
christ
accomplished
he
caused
souls
to
attain
a
station
where
with
complete
willingness
and
joy
they
laid
down
their
lives
what
a
power
thousands
of
human
souls
in
the
utmost
joy
because
of
their
spiritual
susceptibilities
were
so
attracted
to
god
that
they
were
dispossessed
of
volition
deprived
of
will
in
his
path
if
they
had
been
told
simply
that
sacrifice
in
the
path
of
god
was
good
and
praiseworthy
this
would
never
have
happened
they
would
not
have
acted
christ
attracted
them
wrested
the
reins
of
control
from
them
and
they
went
forth
in
ecstasy
to
sacrifice
themselves
qurratulayn
was
a
persian
woman
without
fame
and
importanceunknown
like
all
other
persian
women
when
she
saw
bahaullah
she
changed
completely
visibly
and
looked
within
another
world
the
reins
of
volition
were
taken
out
of
her
hands
by
heavenly
attraction
she
was
so
overcome
that
physical
susceptibilities
ceased
her
husband
her
sons
and
her
family
arose
in
the
greatest
hostility
against
bahaullah
she
became
so
attracted
to
the
divine
threshold
that
she
forsook
everything
and
went
forth
to
the
plain
of
badasht
no
fear
in
her
heart
dauntless
intrepid
openly
proclaiming
the
message
of
light
which
had
come
to
her
the
persian
government
stood
against
her
they
made
every
effort
to
quiet
her
they
imprisoned
her
in
the
governors
house
but
she
continued
to
speak
then
she
was
taken
and
killed
to
her
very
last
breath
she
spoke
with
fervid
eloquence
and
so
became
famous
for
her
complete
attraction
in
the
path
of
god
if
she
had
not
seen
bahaullah
no
such
effect
would
have
been
produced
she
had
read
and
heard
the
teachings
of
scriptures
all
her
life
but
the
action
and
enkindlement
were
missing
all
women
in
persia
are
enveloped
in
veils
in
public
so
completely
covered
are
they
that
even
the
hand
is
not
visible
this
rigid
veiling
is
unspeakable
qurratulayn
tore
off
her
veils
and
went
forth
fearlessly
she
was
like
a
lioness
her
action
caused
a
great
turmoil
throughout
the
land
of
persia
so
excessive
and
compulsory
is
the
requirement
for
veiling
in
the
east
that
the
people
in
the
west
have
no
idea
of
the
excitement
and
indignation
produced
by
the
appearance
of
an
unveiled
woman
qurratulayn
lost
all
thought
of
herself
and
was
unconscious
of
fear
in
her
attraction
to
god
question
do
the
bahai
women
go
without
veils
in
the
east
answer
it
is
not
possible
for
them
to
do
so
universally
yet
but
the
conditions
are
not
nearly
so
restrictive
as
they
were
the
bahai
men
and
women
meet
together
this
is
the
beginning
of
womans
emancipation
from
the
thralldom
of
centuries
qurratulayn
was
really
the
liberator
of
all
persian
women

every
subject
presented
to
a
thoughtful
audience
must
be
supported
by
rational
proofs
and
logical
arguments
proofs
are
of
four
kinds
first
through
sense
perception
second
through
the
reasoning
faculty
third
from
traditional
or
scriptural
authority
fourth
through
the
medium
of
inspiration
that
is
to
say
there
are
four
criteria
or
standards
of
judgment
by
which
the
human
mind
reaches
its
conclusions
we
will
first
consider
the
criterion
of
the
senses
this
is
a
standard
still
held
to
by
the
materialistic
philosophers
of
the
world
they
believe
that
whatever
is
perceptible
to
the
senses
is
a
verity
a
certainty
and
without
doubt
existent
for
example
they
say
here
is
a
lamp
which
you
see
and
because
it
is
perceptible
to
the
sense
of
sight
you
cannot
doubt
its
existence
there
is
a
tree
your
sense
of
vision
assures
you
of
its
reality
which
is
beyond
question
this
is
a
man
you
see
that
he
is
a
man
therefore
he
exists
in
a
word
everything
confirmed
by
the
senses
is
assumed
to
be
as
undoubted
and
unquestioned
as
the
product
of
five
multiplied
by
five
it
cannot
be
twentysix
nor
less
than
twentyfive
consequently
the
materialistic
philosophers
consider
the
criterion
of
the
senses
to
be
first
and
foremost
but
in
the
estimation
of
the
divine
philosophers
this
proof
and
assurance
is
not
reliable
nay
rather
they
deem
the
standard
of
the
senses
to
be
false
because
it
is
imperfect
sight
for
instance
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
senses
yet
it
is
subject
to
many
aberrations
and
inaccuracies
the
eye
sees
the
mirage
as
a
body
of
water
it
regards
images
in
the
mirror
as
realities
when
they
are
but
reflections
a
man
sailing
upon
the
river
imagines
that
objects
upon
the
shore
are
moving
whereas
he
is
in
motion
and
they
are
stationary
to
the
eye
the
earth
appears
fixed
while
the
sun
and
stars
revolve
about
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
heavenly
orbs
are
stationary
and
the
earth
is
turning
upon
its
axis
the
colossal
suns
planets
and
constellations
which
shine
in
the
heavens
appear
small
nay
infinitesimal
to
human
vision
whereas
in
reality
they
are
vastly
greater
than
the
earth
in
dimension
and
volume
a
whirling
spark
appears
to
the
sight
as
a
circle
of
fire
there
are
numberless
instances
of
this
kind
which
show
the
error
and
inaccuracy
of
the
senses
therefore
the
divine
philosophers
have
considered
this
standard
of
judgment
to
be
defective
and
unreliable
the
second
criterion
is
that
of
the
intellect
the
ancient
philosophers
in
particular
considered
the
intellect
to
be
the
most
important
agency
of
judgment
among
the
wise
men
of
greece
rome
persia
and
egypt
the
criterion
of
true
proof
was
reason
they
held
that
every
matter
submitted
to
the
reasoning
faculty
could
be
proved
true
or
false
and
must
be
accepted
or
rejected
accordingly
but
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
of
insight
this
criterion
is
likewise
defective
and
unreliable
for
these
same
philosophers
who
held
to
reason
or
intellect
as
the
standard
of
human
judgment
have
differed
widely
among
themselves
upon
every
subject
of
investigation
the
statements
of
the
greek
philosophers
are
contradictory
to
the
conclusions
of
the
persian
sages
even
among
the
greek
philosophers
themselves
there
is
continual
variance
and
lack
of
agreement
upon
any
given
subject
great
difference
of
thought
also
prevailed
between
the
wise
men
of
greece
and
rome
therefore
if
the
criterion
of
reason
or
intellect
constituted
a
correct
and
infallible
standard
of
judgment
those
who
tested
and
applied
it
should
have
arrived
at
the
same
conclusions
as
they
differ
and
are
contradictory
in
conclusions
it
is
an
evidence
that
the
method
and
standard
of
test
must
have
been
faulty
and
insufficient
the
third
criterion
or
standard
of
proof
is
traditional
or
scripturalnamely
that
every
statement
or
conclusion
should
be
supported
by
traditions
recorded
in
certain
religious
books
when
we
come
to
consider
even
the
holy
booksthe
books
of
godwe
are
led
to
ask
who
understands
these
books
by
what
authority
of
explanation
may
these
books
be
understood
it
must
be
the
authority
of
human
reason
and
if
reason
or
intellect
finds
itself
incapable
of
explaining
certain
questions
or
if
the
possessors
of
intellect
contradict
each
other
in
the
interpretation
of
traditions
how
can
such
a
criterion
be
relied
upon
for
accurate
conclusions
the
fourth
standard
is
that
of
inspiration
in
past
centuries
many
philosophers
have
claimed
illumination
or
revelation
prefacing
their
statements
by
the
announcement
that
this
subject
has
been
revealed
through
me
or
thus
do
i
speak
by
inspiration
of
this
class
were
the
philosophers
of
the
illuminati
inspirations
are
the
promptings
or
susceptibilities
of
the
human
heart
the
promptings
of
the
heart
are
sometimes
satanic
how
are
we
to
differentiate
them
how
are
we
to
tell
whether
a
given
statement
is
an
inspiration
and
prompting
of
the
heart
through
the
merciful
assistance
or
through
the
satanic
agency
consequently
it
has
become
evident
that
the
four
criteria
or
standards
of
judgment
by
which
the
human
mind
reaches
its
conclusions
are
faulty
and
inaccurate
all
of
them
are
liable
to
mistake
and
error
in
conclusions
but
a
statement
presented
to
the
mind
accompanied
by
proofs
which
the
senses
can
perceive
to
be
correct
which
the
faculty
of
reason
can
accept
which
is
in
accord
with
traditional
authority
and
sanctioned
by
the
promptings
of
the
heart
can
be
adjudged
and
relied
upon
as
perfectly
correct
for
it
has
been
proved
and
tested
by
all
the
standards
of
judgment
and
found
to
be
complete
when
we
apply
but
one
test
there
are
possibilities
of
mistake
this
is
selfevident
and
manifest
we
will
now
consider
the
subject
of
love
which
has
been
suggested
submitting
it
to
the
four
standards
of
judgment
and
thereby
reaching
our
conclusions
we
declare
that
love
is
the
cause
of
the
existence
of
all
phenomena
and
that
the
absence
of
love
is
the
cause
of
disintegration
or
nonexistence
love
is
the
conscious
bestowal
of
god
the
bond
of
affiliation
in
all
phenomena
we
will
first
consider
the
proof
of
this
through
sense
perception
as
we
look
upon
the
universe
we
observe
that
all
composite
beings
or
existing
phenomena
are
made
up
primarily
of
single
elements
bound
together
by
a
power
of
attraction
through
this
power
of
attraction
cohesion
has
become
manifest
between
atoms
of
these
composing
elements
the
resultant
being
is
a
phenomenon
of
the
lower
contingent
type
the
power
of
cohesion
expressed
in
the
mineral
kingdom
is
in
reality
love
or
affinity
manifested
in
a
low
degree
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
mineral
world
we
take
a
step
higher
into
the
vegetable
kingdom
where
we
find
an
increased
power
of
attraction
has
become
manifest
among
the
composing
elements
which
form
phenomena
through
this
degree
of
attraction
a
cellular
admixture
is
produced
among
these
elements
which
make
up
the
body
of
a
plant
therefore
in
the
degree
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
there
is
love
we
enter
the
animal
kingdom
and
find
the
attractive
power
binding
together
single
elements
as
in
the
mineral
plus
the
cellular
admixture
as
in
the
vegetable
plus
the
phenomena
of
feelings
or
susceptibilities
we
observe
that
the
animals
are
susceptible
to
certain
affiliation
and
fellowship
and
that
they
exercise
natural
selection
this
elemental
attraction
this
admixture
and
selective
affinity
is
love
manifest
in
the
degree
of
the
animal
kingdom
finally
we
come
to
the
kingdom
of
man
as
this
is
the
superior
kingdom
the
light
of
love
is
more
resplendent
in
man
we
find
the
power
of
attraction
among
the
elements
which
compose
his
material
body
plus
the
attraction
which
produces
cellular
admixture
or
augmentative
power
plus
the
attraction
which
characterizes
the
sensibilities
of
the
animal
kingdom
but
still
beyond
and
above
all
these
lower
powers
we
discover
in
the
being
of
man
the
attraction
of
heart
the
susceptibilities
and
affinities
which
bind
men
together
enabling
them
to
live
and
associate
in
friendship
and
solidarity
it
is
therefore
evident
that
in
the
world
of
humanity
the
greatest
king
and
sovereign
is
love
if
love
were
extinguished
the
power
of
attraction
dispelled
the
affinity
of
human
hearts
destroyed
the
phenomena
of
human
life
would
disappear
this
is
a
proof
perceptible
to
the
senses
acceptable
to
reason
in
accord
with
traditions
and
teachings
of
the
holy
books
and
verified
by
the
promptings
of
human
hearts
themselves
it
is
a
proof
upon
which
we
can
absolutely
rely
and
declare
to
be
complete
but
these
are
only
degrees
of
love
which
exist
in
the
natural
or
physical
world
their
manifestation
is
ever
according
to
the
requirement
of
natural
conditions
and
standards
real
love
is
the
love
which
exists
between
god
and
his
servants
the
love
which
binds
together
holy
souls
this
is
the
love
of
the
spiritual
world
not
the
love
of
physical
bodies
and
organisms
for
example
consider
and
observe
how
the
bestowals
of
god
successively
descend
upon
mankind
how
the
divine
effulgences
ever
shine
upon
the
human
world
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
these
bestowals
these
bounties
these
effulgences
emanate
from
love
unless
love
be
the
divine
motive
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
heart
of
man
to
attain
or
receive
them
unless
love
exists
the
divine
blessing
could
not
descend
upon
any
object
or
thing
unless
there
be
love
the
recipient
of
divine
effulgence
could
not
radiate
and
reflect
that
effulgence
upon
other
objects
if
we
are
of
those
who
perceive
we
realize
that
the
bounties
of
god
manifest
themselves
continuously
even
as
the
rays
of
the
sun
unceasingly
emanate
from
the
solar
center
the
phenomenal
world
through
the
resplendent
effulgence
of
the
sun
is
radiant
and
bright
in
the
same
way
the
realm
of
hearts
and
spirits
is
illumined
and
resuscitated
through
the
shining
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
and
the
bounties
of
the
love
of
god
thereby
the
world
of
existence
the
kingdom
of
hearts
and
spirits
is
ever
quickened
into
life
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
hearts
would
be
inanimate
spirits
would
wither
and
the
reality
of
man
would
be
bereft
of
the
everlasting
bestowals
consider
to
what
extent
the
love
of
god
makes
itself
manifest
among
the
signs
of
his
love
which
appear
in
the
world
are
the
dawning
points
of
his
manifestations
what
an
infinite
degree
of
love
is
reflected
by
the
divine
manifestations
toward
mankind
for
the
sake
of
guiding
the
people
they
have
willingly
forfeited
their
lives
to
resuscitate
human
hearts
they
have
accepted
the
cross
to
enable
human
souls
to
attain
the
supreme
degree
of
advancement
they
have
suffered
during
their
limited
years
extreme
ordeals
and
difficulties
if
jesus
christ
had
not
possessed
love
for
the
world
of
humanity
surely
he
would
not
have
welcomed
the
cross
he
was
crucified
for
the
love
of
mankind
consider
the
infinite
degree
of
that
love
without
love
for
humanity
john
the
baptist
would
not
have
offered
his
life
it
has
been
likewise
with
all
the
prophets
and
holy
souls
if
the
bab
had
not
manifested
love
for
mankind
surely
he
would
not
have
offered
his
breast
for
a
thousand
bullets
if
bahaullah
had
not
been
aflame
with
love
for
humanity
he
would
not
have
willingly
accepted
forty
years
imprisonment
observe
how
rarely
human
souls
sacrifice
their
pleasure
or
comfort
for
others
how
improbable
that
a
man
would
offer
his
eye
or
suffer
himself
to
be
dismembered
for
the
benefit
of
another
yet
all
the
divine
manifestations
suffered
offered
their
lives
and
blood
sacrificed
their
existence
comfort
and
all
they
possessed
for
the
sake
of
mankind
therefore
consider
how
much
they
love
were
it
not
for
their
love
for
humanity
spiritual
love
would
be
mere
nomenclature
were
it
not
for
their
illumination
human
souls
would
not
be
radiant
how
effective
is
their
love
this
is
a
sign
of
the
love
of
god
a
ray
of
the
sun
of
reality
therefore
we
must
give
praise
unto
god
for
it
is
the
light
of
his
bounty
which
has
shone
upon
us
through
his
love
which
is
everlasting
his
divine
manifestations
have
offered
their
lives
through
love
for
us
consider
then
what
the
love
of
god
means
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
all
the
spirits
would
be
inanimate
the
meaning
of
this
is
not
physical
death
nay
rather
it
is
that
condition
concerning
which
christ
declared
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
for
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
the
hearts
would
not
be
illumined
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
the
pathway
of
the
kingdom
would
not
be
opened
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
the
holy
books
would
not
have
been
revealed
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
the
divine
prophets
would
not
have
been
sent
to
the
world
the
foundation
of
all
these
bestowals
is
the
love
of
god
therefore
in
the
human
world
there
is
no
greater
power
than
the
love
of
god
it
is
the
love
of
god
which
has
brought
us
together
here
tonight
it
is
the
love
of
god
which
is
affiliating
the
east
and
the
west
it
is
the
love
of
god
which
has
resuscitated
the
world
now
we
must
offer
thanks
to
god
that
such
a
great
bestowal
and
effulgence
has
been
revealed
to
us
we
come
to
another
aspect
of
our
subject
are
the
workings
and
effects
of
love
confined
to
this
world
or
do
they
extend
on
and
on
to
another
existence
will
its
influence
affect
our
existence
here
only
or
will
it
extend
to
the
everlasting
life
when
we
look
upon
the
human
kingdom
we
readily
observe
that
it
is
superior
to
all
others
in
the
differentiation
of
life
in
the
world
of
existence
there
are
four
degrees
or
kingdoms
the
mineral
vegetable
animal
and
human
the
mineral
kingdom
is
possessed
of
a
certain
virtue
which
we
term
cohesion
the
vegetable
kingdom
possesses
cohesive
properties
plus
the
power
of
growth
or
augmentative
power
the
animal
kingdom
is
possessed
of
the
virtues
of
the
mineral
and
vegetable
plus
the
powers
of
the
senses
but
the
animal
although
gifted
with
sensibilities
is
utterly
bereft
of
consciousness
absolutely
out
of
touch
with
the
world
of
consciousness
and
spirit
the
animal
possesses
no
powers
by
which
it
can
make
discoveries
which
lie
beyond
the
realm
of
the
senses
it
has
no
power
of
intellectual
origination
for
example
an
animal
located
in
europe
is
not
capable
of
discovering
the
continent
of
america
it
understands
only
phenomena
which
come
within
the
range
of
its
senses
and
instinct
it
cannot
abstractly
reason
out
anything
the
animal
cannot
conceive
of
the
earth
being
spherical
or
revolving
upon
its
axis
it
cannot
apprehend
that
the
little
stars
in
the
heavens
are
tremendous
worlds
vastly
greater
than
the
earth
the
animal
cannot
abstractly
conceive
of
intellect
of
these
powers
it
is
bereft
therefore
these
powers
are
peculiar
to
man
and
it
is
made
evident
that
in
the
human
kingdom
there
is
a
reality
of
which
the
animal
is
lacking
what
is
that
reality
it
is
the
spirit
of
man
by
it
man
is
distinguished
above
all
the
other
phenomenal
kingdoms
although
he
possesses
all
the
virtues
of
the
lower
kingdoms
he
is
further
endowed
with
the
spiritual
faculty
the
heavenly
gift
of
consciousness
all
material
phenomena
are
subject
to
nature
all
material
organisms
are
captives
of
nature
none
of
them
can
deviate
in
the
slightest
from
the
laws
of
nature
this
earth
these
great
mountains
the
animals
with
their
wonderful
powers
and
instincts
cannot
go
beyond
natural
limitations
all
things
are
captives
of
nature
except
man
man
is
the
sovereign
of
nature
he
breaks
natures
laws
though
an
animal
fitted
by
nature
to
live
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
he
flies
in
the
air
like
a
bird
sails
upon
the
ocean
and
dives
deep
beneath
its
waves
in
submarines
man
is
gifted
with
a
power
whereby
he
penetrates
and
discovers
the
laws
of
nature
brings
them
forth
from
the
world
of
invisibility
into
the
plane
of
visibility
electricity
was
once
a
latent
force
of
nature
according
to
natures
laws
it
should
remain
a
hidden
secret
but
the
spirit
of
man
discovered
it
brought
it
forth
from
its
secret
depository
and
made
its
phenomena
visible
it
is
evident
and
manifest
that
man
is
capable
of
breaking
natures
laws
how
does
he
accomplish
it
through
a
spirit
with
which
god
has
endowed
him
at
creation
this
is
a
proof
that
the
spirit
of
man
differentiates
and
distinguishes
him
above
all
the
lower
kingdoms
it
is
this
spirit
to
which
the
verse
in
the
old
testament
refers
when
it
states
and
god
said
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
the
spirit
of
man
alone
penetrates
the
realities
of
god
and
partakes
of
the
divine
bounties
this
great
power
must
evidently
be
differentiated
from
the
physical
body
or
temple
in
which
it
is
manifested
observe
and
understand
how
this
human
body
changes
nevertheless
the
spirit
of
man
remains
ever
in
the
same
condition
for
instance
the
body
sometimes
grows
weak
it
becomes
strong
or
stout
sometimes
it
grows
smaller
or
may
be
dismembered
but
there
is
no
effect
upon
the
spirit
the
eye
may
become
blind
the
foot
may
be
amputated
but
no
imperfection
afflicts
the
spirit
this
is
proof
that
the
spirit
of
man
is
distinct
from
his
body
defects
in
the
body
or
its
members
do
not
imply
defects
in
the
spirit
this
leads
to
the
accurate
conclusion
that
if
the
whole
body
should
be
subjected
to
a
radical
change
the
spirit
will
survive
that
change
that
even
if
the
body
of
man
is
destroyed
and
becomes
nonexistent
the
spirit
of
man
remains
unaffected
for
the
spirit
of
man
is
everlasting
sometimes
the
body
sleeps
the
eyes
do
not
see
the
ears
do
not
hear
the
members
cease
to
act
every
function
is
as
inactive
as
death
nevertheless
the
spirit
sees
hears
and
soars
on
high
for
it
is
possessed
of
these
faculties
which
operate
without
the
instrumentality
of
the
body
in
the
world
of
thought
it
sees
without
eyes
hears
without
ears
and
travels
without
the
motion
of
foot
without
physical
force
it
exercises
every
function
this
makes
it
evident
that
during
sleep
the
spirit
is
alive
though
the
body
is
as
dead
in
the
world
of
dreams
the
body
becomes
absolutely
passive
but
the
spirit
still
functions
actively
possessed
of
all
susceptibilities
this
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
life
of
the
spirit
is
neither
conditional
nor
dependent
upon
the
life
of
the
body
at
most
it
can
be
said
that
the
body
is
a
mere
garment
utilized
by
the
spirit
if
that
garment
be
destroyed
the
wearer
is
not
affected
but
is
in
fact
protected
furthermore
all
phenomena
are
subject
to
changes
from
one
condition
to
another
and
the
revolution
caused
by
this
transformation
produces
a
form
of
nonexistence
for
instance
when
a
man
is
transformed
from
the
human
kingdom
to
the
mineral
we
say
that
he
is
dead
for
he
has
relinquished
the
physical
form
of
man
and
assumed
the
condition
of
the
mineral
substances
this
transformation
or
transmutation
is
called
death
therefore
it
follows
that
no
phenomenal
organism
can
be
possessed
of
two
forms
at
the
same
time
if
an
object
or
phenomenon
presents
a
triangular
shape
it
cannot
simultaneously
possess
the
shape
of
a
square
if
it
is
spherical
it
cannot
at
the
same
time
be
pentagonal
or
hexagonal
in
order
to
assume
any
given
figure
or
form
it
must
relinquish
its
previous
shape
or
dimension
thus
the
triangular
must
be
abandoned
to
assume
the
square
the
square
must
change
to
become
a
pentagon
these
transformations
or
changes
from
one
condition
to
another
are
equivalent
to
death
but
the
reality
of
man
the
human
spirit
is
simultaneously
possessed
of
all
forms
and
figures
without
being
bereft
of
any
of
them
it
does
not
require
transformation
from
one
concept
to
another
were
it
to
be
bereft
of
one
or
all
figures
we
would
then
say
it
has
been
transferred
to
another
and
this
would
be
equivalent
to
death
but
as
the
human
spirit
possesses
all
the
figures
simultaneously
it
has
no
transformation
or
death
again
according
to
natural
philosophy
it
is
an
assured
fact
that
single
or
simple
elements
are
indestructible
as
nature
is
indestructible
every
simple
element
of
nature
is
lasting
and
permanent
death
and
annihilation
affect
only
compounds
and
compositions
that
is
to
say
compositions
are
destructible
when
decomposition
takes
place
death
occurs
for
example
certain
single
elements
have
combined
to
make
this
flower
when
this
combination
is
disintegrated
this
composition
decomposed
the
flower
dies
as
an
organism
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
but
the
single
elements
of
which
this
flower
is
composed
do
not
suffer
death
for
all
single
elements
are
permanent
everlasting
and
not
subject
to
destruction
they
are
indestructible
because
they
are
single
and
not
compound
thus
they
cannot
disintegrate
nor
become
separated
in
their
component
atoms
but
are
single
simple
and
therefore
everlasting
if
an
elementary
substance
is
possessed
of
immortality
how
can
the
human
spirit
or
reality
which
is
wholly
above
combination
and
composition
be
destroyed
nay
rather
that
spirit
which
is
all
in
all
is
a
unit
and
not
a
compound
its
destruction
therefore
is
not
possible
the
spirit
of
man
transcends
the
qualities
and
attributes
of
any
natural
element
it
is
greater
in
attributes
than
gold
silver
or
iron
which
are
single
elements
and
indestructible
as
they
are
free
from
destruction
and
qualified
with
permanence
how
much
more
so
is
the
human
spirit
free
and
immortal
how
will
that
ever
be
destroyed
this
is
a
subject
of
great
importance
there
are
innumerable
proofs
in
support
of
it
i
hope
we
may
continue
it
at
another
time
before
we
leave
i
desire
to
offer
a
prayer
in
behalf
of
miss
farmer
for
verily
she
has
been
the
founder
of
this
organization
the
source
of
this
loving
fellowship
and
assemblage
o
thou
kind
god
encircle
these
servants
with
the
glances
of
thy
providence
set
aglow
the
hearts
of
this
assemblage
with
the
fire
of
thy
love
illumine
these
faces
with
the
light
of
heaven
enlighten
these
hearts
with
the
light
of
the
most
great
guidance
o
god
the
clouds
of
superstitions
have
covered
the
horizons
of
the
hearts
o
lord
dispel
these
clouds
so
that
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
reality
may
shine
o
lord
illumine
our
eyes
so
that
we
may
behold
thy
light
o
lord
attune
our
ears
so
that
we
may
hear
the
call
of
the
supreme
concourse
o
lord
render
our
tongues
eloquent
so
that
we
may
become
engaged
in
thy
commemoration
o
lord
sanctify
and
purify
the
hearts
so
that
the
effulgence
of
thy
love
may
shine
therein
o
thou
kind
lord
bestow
quick
recovery
through
thy
power
and
bounty
upon
the
founder
of
this
association
o
lord
this
woman
has
served
thee
has
turned
her
face
toward
thy
kingdom
and
has
established
these
conferences
in
order
that
reality
might
be
investigated
and
the
light
of
reality
shine
o
lord
be
thou
ever
her

o
lord
be
thou
ever
her
comforter
o
lord
bestow
upon
her
quick
healing
verily
thou

mckinney
the
physical
beauty
of
this
place
is
very
wonderful
we
hope
that
a
spiritual
charm
may
surround
and
halo
it
then
its
beauty
will
be
perfect
there
is
a
spiritual
atmosphere
manifest
here
particularly
at
sunset
in
cities
like
new
york
the
people
are
submerged
in
the
sea
of
materialism
their
sensibilities
are
attuned
to
material
forces
their
perceptions
purely
physical
the
animal
energies
predominate
in
their
activities
all
their
thoughts
are
directed
to
material
things
day
and
night
they
are
devoted
to
the
attractions
of
this
world
without
aspiration
beyond
the
life
that
is
vanishing
and
mortal
in
schools
and
temples
of
learning
knowledge
of
the
sciences
acquired
is
based
upon
material
observations
only
there
is
no
realization
of
divinity
in
their
methods
and
conclusionsall
have
reference
to
the
world
of
matter
they
are
not
interested
in
attaining
knowledge
of
the
mysteries
of
god
or
understanding
the
secrets
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
what
they
acquire
is
based
altogether
upon
visible
and
tangible
evidences
beyond
these
evidences
they
are
without
susceptibilities
they
have
no
idea
of
the
world
of
inner
significances
and
are
utterly
out
of
touch
with
god
considering
this
an
indication
of
reasonable
attitude
and
philosophical
judgement
whereof
they
are
selfsufficient
and
proud
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
supposed
excellence
is
possessed
in
its
superlative
degree
by
the
animals
the
animals
are
without
knowledge
of
god
so
to
speak
they
are
deniers
of
divinity
and
understand
nothing
of
the
kingdom
and
its
heavenly
mysteries
as
deniers
of
the
kingdom
they
are
utterly
ignorant
of
spiritual
things
and
uninformed
of
the
supernatural
world
therefore
if
it
be
a
perfection
and
virtue
to
be
without
knowledge
of
god
and
his
kingdom
the
animals
have
attained
the
highest
degree
of
excellence
and
proficiency
then
the
donkey
is
the
greatest
scientist
and
the
cow
an
accomplished
naturalist
for
they
have
obtained
what
they
know
without
schooling
and
years
of
laborious
study
in
colleges
trusting
implicitly
to
the
evidence
of
the
senses
and
relying
solely
upon
intuitive
virtues
the
cow
for
instance
is
a
lover
of
the
visible
and
a
believer
in
the
tangible
contented
and
happy
when
pasture
is
plenty
perfectly
serene
a
blissful
exponent
of
the
transcendental
school
of
philosophy
such
is
the
status
of
the
material
philosophers
who
glory
in
sharing
the
condition
of
the
cow
imagining
themselves
in
a
lofty
station
reflect
upon
their
ignorance
and
blindness
nay
rather
the
virtue
of
man
is
this
that
he
can
investigate
the
ideals
of
the
kingdom
and
attain
knowledge
which
is
denied
the
animal
in
its
limitation
the
station
of
man
is
this
that
he
has
the
power
to
attain
those
ideals
and
thereby
differentiate
and
consciously
distinguish
himself
an
infinite
degree
above
the
kingdoms
of
existence
below
him
the
station
of
man
is
great
very
great
god
has
created
man
after
his
own
image
and
likeness
he
has
endowed
him
with
a
mighty
power
which
is
capable
of
discovering
the
mysteries
of
phenomena
through
its
use
man
is
able
to
arrive
at
ideal
conclusions
instead
of
being
restricted
to
the
mere
plane
of
sense
impressions
as
he
possesses
sense
endowment
in
common
with
the
animals
it
is
evident
that
he
is
distinguished
above
them
by
his
conscious
power
of
penetrating
abstract
realities
he
acquires
divine
wisdom
he
searches
out
the
mysteries
of
creation
he
witnesses
the
radiance
of
omnipotence
he
attains
the
second
birththat
is
to
say
he
is
born
out
of
the
material
world
just
as
he
is
born
of
the
mother
he
attains
to
everlasting
life
he
draws
nearer
to
god
his
heart
is
replete
with
the
love
of
god
this
is
the
foundation
of
the

although
the
body
was
weak
and
not
fitted
to
undergo
the
vicissitudes
of
crossing
the
atlantic
yet
love
assisted
us
and
we
came
here
at
certain
times
the
spirit
must
assist
the
body
we
cannot
accomplish
really
great
things
through
physical
force
alone
the
spirit
must
fortify
our
bodily
strength
for
example
the
body
of
man
may
be
able
to
withstand
the
ordeal
of
imprisonment
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
under
temperate
conditions
of
climate
and
restful
physical
routine
during
our
imprisonment
in
akka
means
of
comfort
were
lacking
troubles
and
persecutions
of
all
kinds
surrounded
us
yet
notwithstanding
such
distressful
conditions
we
were
able
to
endure
these
trials
for
forty
years
the
climate
was
very
bad
necessities
and
conveniences
of
life
were
denied
us
yet
we
endured
this
narrow
prison
forty
years
what
was
the
reason
the
spirit
was
strengthening
and
resuscitating
the
body
constantly
we
lived
through
this
long
difficult
period
in
the
utmost
love
and
heavenly
servitude
the
spirit
must
assist
the
body
under
certain
conditions
which
surround
us
because
the
body
of
itself
cannot
endure
the
extreme
strain
of
such
hardships
the
human
body
is
in
reality
very
weak
there
is
no
physical
body
more
delicately
constituted
one
mosquito
will
distress
it
the
smallest
quantity
of
poison
will
destroy
it
if
respiration
ceases
for
a

it
will
die
what
instrument
could
be
weaker
and
more
delicate
a
blade
of
grass
severed
from
the
root
may
live
an
hour
whereas
a
human
body
deprived
of
its
forces
may
die
in
one
minute
but
in
the
proportion
that
the
human
body
is
weak
the
spirit
of
man
is
strong
it
can
control
natural
phenomena
it
is
a
supernatural
power
which
transcends
all
contingent
beings
it
has
immortal
life
which
nothing
can
destroy
or
pervert
if
all
the
kingdoms
of
life
arise
against
the
immortal
spirit
of
man
and
seek
its
destruction
this
immortal
spirit
singly
and
alone
can
withstand
their
attacks
in
fearless
firmness
and
resolution
because
it
is
indestructible
and
empowered
with
supreme
natural
virtues
for
this
reason
we
say
that
the
spirit
of
man
can
penetrate
and
discover
the
realities
of
all
things
can
solve
the
secrets
and
mysteries
of
all
created
objects
while
living
upon
the
earth
it
discovers
the
stars
and
their
satellites
it
travels
underground
finds
the
metals
in
their
hidden
depths
and
unlocks
the
secrets
of
geological
ages
it
can
cross
the
abysses
of
interstellar
space
and
discover
the
motion
of
inconceivably
distant
suns
how
wonderful
it
is
it
can
attain
to
the
kingdom
of
god
it
can
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
divine
kingdom
and
attain
to
everlasting
life
it
receives
illumination
from
the
light
of
god
and
reflects
it
to
the
whole
universe
how
wonderful
it
is
how
powerful
the
spirit
of
man
while
his
body
is
so
weak
if
the
susceptibilities
of
the
spirit
control
him
there
is
no
created
being
more
heroic
more
undaunted
than
man
but
if
physical
forces
dominate
you
cannot
find
a
more
cowardly
or
fearful
object
because
the
body
is
so
weak
and
incapable
therefore
it
is
divinely
intended
that
the
spiritual
susceptibilities
of
man
should
gain
precedence
and
overrule
his
physical
forces
in
this
way
he
becomes
fitted
to
dominate
the
human
world
by
his
nobility
and
stand
forth
fearless
and
free
endowed
with
the
attributes
of
eternal

of

of

the
cause
of
uniting

and
binding
together
the
east
and
the
west
this
is
my
hope
tonight
i
wish
to
speak
upon
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
this
is
one
of
the
important
subjects
of
the
present
period
if
the
oneness
of
the
human
world
were
established
all
the
differences
which
separate
mankind
would
be
eradicated
strife
and
warfare
would
cease
and
the
world
of
humanity
would
find
repose
universal
peace
would
be
promoted
and
the
east
and
west
would
be
conjoined
in
a
strong
bond
all
men
would
be
sheltered
beneath
one
tabernacle
native
lands
would
become
one
races
and
religions
would
be
unified
the
people
of
the
world
would
live
together
in
harmony
and
their
wellbeing
would
be
assured
from
the
beginning
of
human
history
down
to
the
present
time
the
various
religions
of
the
world
have
anathematized
and
accused
each
other
of
falsity
each
religion
has
considered
the
others
bereft
of
the
face
of
god
deprived
of
his
mercy
and
in
the
direct
line
of
divine
wrath
therefore
they
have
shunned
each
other
most
rigidly
exercising
mutual
animosity
and
rancor
consider
the
record
of
religious
warfare
the
battles
between
nations
the
bloodshed
and
destruction
in
the
name
of
religion
one
of
the
greatest
religious
wars
the
crusades
extended
over
a
period
of
two
hundred
years
in
this
succession
of
great
campaigns
the
western
crusaders
were
constantly
invading
the
orient
bent
upon
recovering
the
holy
city
from
the
hands
of
the
islamic
people
army
after
army
raised
in
europe
poured
its
fanatical
legions
into
the
east
the
kings
of
european
nations
personally
led
these
crusades
killing
and
shedding
the
blood
of
the
orientals
during
this
period
of
two
hundred
years
the
east
and
west
were
in
a
state
of
violence
and
commotion
sometimes
the
crusaders
were
successful
killing
pillaging
and
taking
captive
the
muslim
people
sometimes
the
muslims
were
victorious
inflicting
bloodshed
death
and
ruin
in
turn
upon
the
invaders
so
they
continued
for
two
centuries
alternately
fighting
with
fury
and
relaxing
from
weakness
until
the
european
religionists
withdrew
from
the
east
leaving
ashes
of
desolation
behind
them
and
finding
their
own
nations
in
a
condition
of
turbulence
and
upheaval
hundreds
of
thousands
of
human
beings
were
killed
and
untold
wealth
wasted
in
this
fruitless
religious
warfare
how
many
fathers
mourned
the
loss
of
their
sons
how
many
mothers
and
wives
lamented
the
absence
of
their
dear
ones
yet
this
was
only
one
of
the
holy
wars
consider
and
reflect
religious
wars
have
been
many
nine
hundred
thousand
martyrs
to
the
protestant
cause
was
the
record
of
conflict
and
difference
between
that
sect
of
christians
and
the
catholics
consult
history
and
confirm
this
how
many
languished
in
prisons
how
merciless
the
treatment
of
captives
all
in
the
name
of
religion
consider
and
estimate
the
outcome
of
other
wars
between
the
people
and
sects
of
religious
belief
from
the
beginning
of
human
history
down
to
this
time
the
world
of
humanity
has
not
enjoyed
a
day
of
absolute
rest
and
relaxation
from
conflict
and
strife
most
of
the
wars
have
been
caused
by
religious
prejudice
fanaticism
and
sectarian
hatred
religionists
have
anathematized
religionists
each
considering
the
other
as
deprived
of
the
mercy
of
god
abiding
in
gross
darkness
and
the
children
of
satan
for
example
the
christians
and
muslims
considered
the
jews
satanic
and
the
enemies
of
god
therefore
they
cursed
and
persecuted
them
great
numbers
of
jews
were
killed
their
houses
burned
and
pillaged
their
children
carried
into
captivity
the
jews
in
turn
regarded
the
christians
as
infidels
and
the
muslims
as
enemies
and
destroyers
of
the
law
of
moses
therefore
they
call
down
vengeance
upon
them
and
curse
them
even
to
this
day
consider
what
injuries
ordeals
and
calamities
have
been
inflicted
upon
mankind
since
the
beginning
of
history
every
city
country
nation
and
people
has
been
subjected
to
the
destruction
and
havoc
of
war
each
one
of
the
divine
religions
considers
itself
as
belonging
to
a
goodly
and
blessed
tree
the
tree
of
the
merciful
and
all
other
religious
systems
as
belonging
to
a
tree
of
evil
the
tree
of
satan
for
this
reason
they
heap
execration
and
abuse
upon
each
other
this
is
clearly
apparent
in
books
of
historical
record
and
prevailed
until
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
bahaullah
when
the
light
of
bahaullah
dawned
from
the
east
he
proclaimed
the
promise
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
he
addressed
all
mankind
saying
ye
are
all
the
fruits
of
one
tree
there
are
not
two
trees
one
a
tree
of
divine
mercy
the
other
the
tree
of
satan
again
he
said
ye
are
all
the
fruits
of
one
tree
the
leaves
of
one
branch
this
was
his
announcement
this
was
his
promise
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
anathema
and
execration
were
utterly
abrogated
he
said
it
is
not
becoming
in
man
to
curse
another
it
is
not
befitting
that
man
should
attribute
darkness
to
another
it
is
not
meet
that
one
human
being
should
consider
another
human
being
as
bad
nay
rather
all
mankind
are
the
servants
of
one
god
god
is
the
father
of
all
there
is
not
a
single
exception
to
that
law
there
are
no
people
of
satan
all
belong
to
the
merciful
there
is
no
darkness
all
is
light
all
are
the
servants
of
god
and
man
must
love
humanity
from
his
heart
he
must
verily
behold
humanity
as
submerged
in
the
divine
mercy
bahaullah
has
made
no
exception
to
this
rule
he
said
that
among
mankind
there
may
be
those
who
are
ignorant
they
must
be
trained
some
are
sick
they
must
be
treated
some
are
immature
they
must
be
helped
to
attain
maturity
in
other
respects
humanity
is
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
divine
mercy
god
is
the
father
of
all
he
educates
provides
for
and
loves
all
for
they
are
his
servants
and
his
creation
surely
the
creator
loves
his
creatures
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
an
artist
who
does
not
love
his
own
production
have
you
ever
seen
a
man
who
did
not
love
his
own
actions
even
though
they
be
bad
actions
he
loves
them
how
ignorant
therefore
the
thought
that
god
who
created
man
educated
and
nurtured
him
surrounded
him
with
all
blessings
made
the
sun
and
all
phenomenal
existence
for
his
benefit
bestowed
upon
him
tenderness
and
kindness
and
then
did
not
love
him
this
is
palpable
ignorance
for
no
matter
to
what
religion
a
man
belongs
even
though
he
be
an
atheist
or
materialist
nevertheless
god
nurtures
him
bestows
his
kindness
and
sheds
upon
him
his
light
how
then
can
we
believe
god
is
wrathful
and
unloving
how
can
we
even
imagine
this
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
are
witnesses
of
the
tenderness
and
mercy
of
god
upon
every
hand
all
about
us
we
behold
manifestations
of
the
love
of
god
if
therefore
god
be
loving
what
should
we
do
we
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
emulate
him
just
as
god
loves
all
and
is
kind
to
all
so
must
we
really
love
and
be
kind
to
everybody
we
must
consider
none
bad
none
worthy
of
detestation
no
one
as
an
enemy
we
must
love
all
nay
we
must
consider
everyone
as
related
to
us
for
all
are
the
servants
of
one
god
all
are
under
the
instructions
of
one
educator
we
must
strive
day
and
night
that
love
and
amity
may
increase
that
this
bond
of
unity
may
be
strengthened
that
joy
and
happiness
may
more
and
more
prevail
that
in
unity
and
solidarity
all
mankind
may
gather
beneath
the
shadow
of
god
that
people
may
turn
to
god
for
their
sustenance
finding
in
him
the
life
that
is
everlasting
thus
may
they
be
confirmed
in
the
kingdom
of
god
and
live
forever
through
his
grace
and
bounty
bahaullah
has
clearly
said
in
his
tablets
that
if
you
have
an
enemy
consider
him
not
as
an
enemy
do
not
simply
be
longsuffering
nay
rather
love
him
your
treatment
of
him
should
be
that
which
is
becoming
to
lovers
do
not
even
say
that
he
is
your
enemy
do
not
see
any
enemies
though
he
be
your
murderer
see
no
enemy
look
upon
him
with
the
eye
of
friendship
be
mindful
that
you
do
not
consider
him
as
an
enemy
and
simply
tolerate
him
for
that
is
but
stratagem
and
hypocrisy
to
consider
a
man
your
enemy
and
love
him
is
hypocrisy
this
is
not
becoming
of
any
soul
you
must
behold
him
as
a
friend
you
must
treat
him
well
this
is
right
we
return
to
the
subject
when
we
observe
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
we
realize
that
the
axis
around
which
life
revolves
is
love
while
the
axis
around
which
death
and
destruction
revolve
is
animosity
and
hatred
let
us
view
the
mineral
kingdom
here
we
see
that
if
attraction
did
not
exist
between
the
atoms
the
composite
substance
of
matter
would
not
be
possible
every
existent
phenomenon
is
composed
of
elements
and
cellular
particles
this
is
scientifically
true
and
correct
if
attraction
did
not
exist
between
the
elements
and
among
the
cellular
particles
the
composition
of
that
phenomenon
would
never
have
been
possible
for
instance
the
stone
is
an
existent
phenomenon
a
composition
of
elements
a
bond
of
attraction
has
brought
them
together
and
through
this
cohesion
of
ingredients
this
petrous
object
has
been
formed
this
stone
is
the
lowest
degree
of
phenomena
but
nevertheless
within
it
a
power
of
attraction
is
manifest
without
which
the
stone
could
not
exist
this
power
of
attraction
in
the
mineral
world
is
love
the
only
expression
of
love
the
stone
can
manifest
look
now
upon
the
next
highest
stage
of
life
the
vegetable
kingdom
here
we
see
that
the
plant
is
the
result
of
cohesion
among
various
elements
just
as
the
mineral
is
in
its
kingdom
but
furthermore
the
plant
has
the
power
of
absorption
from
the
earth
this
is
a
higher
degree
of
attraction
which
differentiates
the
plant
from
the
mineral
in
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
this
is
an
expression
of
love
the
highest
capacity
of
expression
the
vegetable
possesses
by
this
power
of
attraction
or
augmentation
the
plant
grows
day
by
day
therefore
in
this
kingdom
also
love
is
the
cause
of
life
if
repulsion
existed
among
the
elements
instead
of
attraction
the
result
would
be
disintegration
destruction
and
nonexistence
because
cohesion
exists
among
the
elements
and
cellular
attraction
is
manifest
the
plant
appears
when
this
attraction
is
dispelled
and
the
ingredients
separate
the
plant
ceases
to
exist
then
we
come
to
the
animal
world
which
is
still
higher
in
degree
than
the
vegetable
kingdom
in
it
the
power
of
love
makes
itself
still
more
manifest
the
light
of
love
is
more
resplendent
in
the
animal
kingdom
because
the
power
of
attraction
whereby
elements
cohere
and
cellular
atoms
commingle
now
reveals
itself
in
certain
emotions
and
sensibilities
which
produce
instinctive
fellowship
and
association
the
animals
are
imbued
with
kindness
and
affinity
which
manifests
itself
among
those
of
the
same
species
finally
we
reach
the
kingdom
of
man
here
we
find
that
all
the
degrees
of
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
expressions
of
love
are
present
plus
unmistakable
attractions
of
consciousness
that
is
to
say
man
is
the
possessor
of
a
degree
of
attraction
which
is
conscious
and
spiritual
here
is
an
immeasurable
advance
in
the
human
kingdom
spiritual
susceptibilities
come
into
view
love
exercises
its
superlative
degree
and
this
is
the
cause
of
human
life
the
proof
is
clear
that
in
all
degrees
and
kingdoms
unity
and
agreement
love
and
fellowship
are
the
cause
of
life
whereas
dissension
animosity
and
separation
are
ever
conducive
to
death
therefore
we
must
strive
with
life
and
soul
in
order
that
day
by
day
unity
and
agreement
may
be
increased
among
mankind
and
that
love
and
affinity
may
become
more
resplendently
glorious
and
manifest
in
the
animal
kingdom
you
will

look
at

there
is
no

among

it

than

of

for
in
the
estimation
of

love
is
acceptable
whereas
hatred
and
animosity
are
rejected
why
should
we
act
contrary
to
the
good
pleasure
of
god
why
should
we
be
as
ferocious
animals
constantly
shedding
blood
pillaging
and
destroying
because
we
belong
to
one
race
or
family
of
humankind
why
should
we
consider
all
others
bad
and
inferior
deserving
of
death
pillage
and
invasionpeople
of
darkness
worthy
of
hatred
and
detestation
by
god
why
does
man
show
forth
such
attitude
and
actions
toward
his
fellowman
we
see
that
god
is
kind
to
all
just
as
he
loves
us
he
loves
all
others
just
as
he
provides
for
us
he
provides
for
the
rest
he
nurtures
and
trains
all
with
equal
solicitude
god
is
great
god
is
kind
he
does
not
behold
human
shortcomings
he
does
not
regard
human
weaknesses
man
is
a
creature
of
his
mercy
and
to
his
mercy
he
summons
all
why
then
should
we
despise
or
detest
his
creatures
because
this
one
is
a
jew
another
a
buddhist
or
zoroastrian
and
so
on
this
is
ignorance
for
the
oneness
of
humanity
as
servants
of
god
is
an
assured
and
certain
fact
bahaullah
has
proclaimed
the
promise
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
therefore
we
must
exercise
the
utmost
love
toward
each
other
we
must
be
loving
to
all
the
people
of
the
world
we
must
not
consider
any
people
the
people
of
satan
but
know
and
recognize
all
as
the
servants
of
the
one
god
at
most
it
is
this
some
do
not
know
they
must
be
guided
and
trained
they
must
be
taught
to
love
their
fellow
creatures
and
be
encouraged
in
the
acquisition
of
virtues
some
are
ignorant
they
must
be
informed
some
are
as
children
undeveloped
they
must
be
helped
to
reach
maturity
some
are
ailing
their
moral
condition
is
unhealthy
they
must
be
treated
until
their
morals
are
purified
but
the
sick
man
is
not
to
be
hated
because
he
is
sick
the
child
must
not
be
shunned
because
he
is
a
child
the
ignorant
one
is
not
to
be
despised
because
he
lacks
knowledge
they
must
all
be
treated
educated
trained
and
assisted
in
love
everything
must
be
done
in
order
that
humanity
may
live
under
the
shadow
of
god
in
the
utmost
security
enjoying
happiness
in
its
highest
degree

the
worlds
of
god
are
in
perfect
harmony
and
correspondence
one
with
another
each
world
in
this
limitless
universe
is
as
it
were
a
mirror
reflecting
the
history
and
nature
of
all
the
rest
the
physical
universe
is
likewise
in
perfect
correspondence
with
the
spiritual
or
divine
realm
the
world
of
matter
is
an
outer
expression
or
facsimile
of
the
inner
kingdom
of
spirit
the
world
of
minds
corresponds
with
the
world
of
hearts
if
we
look
reflectively
upon
the
material
world
we
realize
that
all
outer
phenomena
are
dependent
upon
the
sun
without
the
sun
the
phenomenal
world
would
be
in
a
state
of
utter
darkness
and
devoid
of
life
all
earthly
creationwhether
mineral
vegetable
animal
or
humanis
dependent
upon
the
heat
light
and
splendor
of
the
great
central
solar
body
for
training
and
development
were
it
not
for
the
solar
heat
and
sunlight
no
minerals
would
have
been
formed
no
vegetable
animal
and
human
organisms
would
or
could
have
become
existent
it
is
clearly
evident
therefore
that
the
sun
is
the
source
of
life
to
all
earthly
and
outer
phenomena
in
the
inner
world
the
world
of
the
kingdom
the
sun
of
reality
is
the
trainer
and
educator
of
minds
souls
and
spirits
were
it
not
for
the
effulgent
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
they
would
be
deprived
of
growth
and
development
nay
rather
they
would
be
nonexistent
for
just
as
the
physical
sun
is
the
trainer
of
all
outer
and
phenomenal
forms
of
being
through
the
radiation
of
its
light
and
heat
so
the
radiation
of
the
light
and
heat
of
the
sun
of
reality
gives
growth
education
and
evolution
to
minds
souls
and
spirits
toward
the
station
of
perfection
christ
was
the
sun
of
reality
which
shone
from
the
heavenly
horizon
of
christianity
training
protecting
confirming
minds
souls
and
spirits
until
they
came
into
harmony
with
the
divine
kingdom
and
attained
capacity
for
descent
of
the
infinite
bounties
of
god
were
it
not
for
the
appearance
of
his
splendor
they
would
have
remained
in
the
darkness
of
imperfection
and
remoteness
from
god
but
because
that
sun
of
reality
shone
forth
and
flooded
its
light
into
the
world
of
minds
souls
and
spirits
they
became
radiant
he
conferred
a
new
and
eternal
life
upon
them
when
the
phenomenal
sun
appears
from
the
vernal
point
of
dawning
in
the
zodiac
a
wondrous
and
vibrant
commotion
is
set
up
in
the
body
of
the
earthly
world
the
withered
trees
are
quickened
with
animation
the
black
soil
becomes
verdant
with
new
growth
fresh
and
fragrant
flowers
bloom
the
world
of
dust
is
refreshed
renewed
life
forces
surge
through
the
veins
of
every
animate
being
and
a
new
springtime
carpets
the
meadows
plains
mountains
and
valleys
with
wondrous
forms
of
life
that
which
was
dead
and
desolate
is
revived
and
resuscitated
that
which
was
withered
faded
and
stricken
is
transformed
by
the
spirit
of
a
new
creation
in
the
same
way
the
sun
of
reality
when
it
illumines
the
horizon
of
the
inner
world
animates
vivifies
and
quickens
with
a
divine
and
wonderful
power
the
trees
of
human
minds
clothe
themselves
in
new
and
verdant
robes
putting
on
leaves
and
blossoms
and
bearing
spiritual
fruits
of
the
heavenly
glad
tidings
then
fragrant
flowers
of
inner
significances
appear
from
the
soil
of
human
souls
and
the
whole
being
of
man
awakens
to
a
new
and
divine
activity
this
is
the
growth
and
development
of
the
inner
world
through
the
effulgent
light
of
divine
guidance
and
the
heat
of
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
the
physical
sun
has
its
rising
and
its
setting
the
earthly
world
has
its
day
and
its
night
after
each
sunset
there
is
a
sunrise
and
the
coming
of
a
new
dawn
the
sun
of
reality
likewise
has
its
rising
and
setting
there
is
a
day
and
a
night
in
the
world
of
spirituality
after
each
departure
there
is
a
return
and
the
dawning
light
of
a
new
day
furthermore
the
reality
of
divinity
is
characterized
by
certain
names
and
attributes
among
these
names
are
creator
resuscitator
provider
the
allpresent
almighty
omniscient
and
giver
these
names
and
attributes
of
divinity
are
eternal
and
not
accidental
this
is
a
very
subtle
point
which
demands
close
attention
their
existence
is
proved
and
necessitated
by
the
appearance
of
phenomena
for
example
creator
presupposes
creation
resuscitator
implies
resuscitation
provider
necessitates
provision
otherwise
these
would
be
empty
and
impossible
names
merciful
evidences
an
object
upon
which
mercy
is
bestowed
if
mercy
were
not
manifest
this
attribute
of
god
would
not
be
realized
the
name
lord
proves
the
existence
of
subjects
over
whom
sovereignty
is
exercised
the
name
omniscient
demands
the
objects
of
allknowing
unless
these
objects
existed
omniscience
would
be
meaningless
and
without
function
the
name
the
wise
necessitates
objects
for
the
exercise
of
wisdom
and
unless
wisdom
comprehended
them
this
name
would
be
inconceivable
therefore
the
divine
names
and
attributes
presuppose
the
existence
of
phenomena
implied
by
those
names
and
attributes
and
vice
versathe
sovereignty
of
god
is
proved
and
established
through
their
verity
and
being
reflect
then
carefully
that
the
sovereignty
of
god
is
not
accidental
but
everlasting
and
eternal
and
that
it
necessitates
the
existence
of
phenomenal
being
kingship
necessitates
a
kingdom
an
army
a
treasury
subjects
a
court
and
ministers
how
could
there
be
a
king
without
subjects
dominion
and
wealth
otherwise
anybody
could
claim
to
be
a
king
where
is
your
army
i
do
not
need
one
where
is
your
country
it
is
unnecessary
i
am
a
king
without
a
kingdom
without
army
subjects
or
sovereignty
is
this
possible
therefore
divine
sovereignty
necessitates
a
creation
over
which
its
dominion
is
exercised
there
must
be
evidences
of
sovereignty
if
we
try
to
conceive
of
a
time
when
creation
was
nonexistent
when
there
were
no
subjects
or
creatures
under
divine
dominion
and
control
divinity
itself
would
disappear
there
would
be
a
cessation
of
the
bounty
of
god
just
as
the
kingship
and
favor
of
an
earthly
monarch
would
disappear
if
his
kingdom
did
not
exist
the
sovereignty
of
god
is
eternal
there
has
been
no
beginning
there
will
be
no
end
this
is
as
evident
as
the
sun
at
midday
even
to
one
endowed
with
limited
reason
when
we
consider
the
phenomenal
sun
we
see
that
its
heat
and
light
are
continuous
there
is
no
cessation
to
the
solar
bounty
if
the
sun
at
any
time
were
without
light
or
heat
it
would
not
be
the
sun
how
do
we
recognize
the
sun
through
its
heat
and
effulgence
if
it
be
deprived
of
its
rays
and
heat
it
is
no
longer
a
sun
it
is
merely
a
dark
globe
or
sphere
in
the
heavens
the
bounties
of
the
sun
must
be
perpetual
in
order
that
it
may
be
qualified
as
a
solar
center
of
energy
illumination
and
attraction
likewise
the
divine
bounties
of
the
sun
of
reality
are
perpetual
its
light
is
forever
shining
its
love
is
forever
radiating
its
bounty
never
ceases
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
power
and
effulgence
of
god
was
ever
subject
to
cessation
it
could
not
be
claimed
that
the
divinity
of
the
almighty
one
had
come
to
an
end
for
the
divinity
of
god
is
eternal
therefore
the
divine
bountieswhether
phenomenal
and
accidental
or
spiritual
and
idealare
perpetual
but
the
people
of
religion
are
of
two
kinds
some
worship
the
sun
and
some
adore
the
dawning
points
from
which
the
sun
rises
for
instance
the
jews
adore
the
mosaic
point
of
dawning
the
zoroastrians
that
of
zoroaster
the
people
of
abraham
turned
to
the
point
of
rising
in
abraham
when
the
sun
of
reality
transferred
its
illumination
from
the
abrahamic
to
the
mosaic
point
of
dawning
the
people
of
abraham
denied
its
appearance
because
they
were
turning
toward
the
point
and
not
to
the
sun
of
reality
itself
when
that
sun
of
reality
with
its
divine
bestowal
its
heavenly
glow
and
effulgence
transferred
to
the
messianic
point
of
rising
the
jews
denied
its
appearance
in
jesus
for
they
were
not
worshipers
of
the
sun
itself
but
adored
its
rising
in
moses
had
they
been
worshipers
of
the
sun
of
reality
they
would
have
turned
to
christ
instead
of
denying
him
as
the
messiah
what
was
the
reason
of
this
deprivation
it
was
simply
because
they
were
imitating
fathers
and
ancestors
in
forms
of
belief
instead
of
turning
toward
the
sun
of
divinity
for
this
reason
they
were
deprived
of
the
bounty
which
dawned
in
the
messianic
dayspring
holding
tenaciously
to
the
former
dawning
point
they
still
remain
in
this
position
of
deprivation
consider
the
people
and
nations
of
the
earth
today
and
observe
this
same
tenacious
allegiance
to
ancestral
belief
he
whose
father
was
a
zoroastrian
is
a
zoroastrian
he
whose
father
was
a
buddhist
remains
a
buddhist
the
son
of
a
muslim
continues
a
muslim
and
so
on
throughout
why
is
this
because
they
are
slaves
and
captives
of
mere
imitation
they
have
not
investigated
the
reality
of
religion
and
arrived
at
its
fundamentals
and
conclusions
the
jew
for
instance
has
not
proved
the
validity
of
moses
by
investigating
reality
he
is
a
jew
because
his
father
was
a
jew
he
imitates
the
forms
and
belief
of
his
fathers
and
ancestors
there
is
no
thought
or
mention
of
reality
and
so
it
is
with
the
other
peoples
of
religion
this
is
the
purpose
of
our
statement
that
they
worship
the
dawning
point
rather
than
the
sun
of
reality
itself
if
in
the
day
of
jesus
christ
the
jews
had
forsaken
imitation
and
investigated
reality
they
would
assuredly
have
believed
in
and
accepted
him
for
the
messianic
effulgence
was
far
greater
than
the
mosaic
the
sun
of
reality
when
it
appeared
from
the
dawning
point
of
christ
was
as
the
midsummer
sun
in
brilliancy
and
beauty
now
therefore
we
must
be
admonished
and
realize
that
mere
imitation
of
fathers
and
ancestors
is
fruitless
nay
rather
we
must
exert
ourselves
to
the
utmost
in
investigating
and
turning
toward
the
sun
of
reality
no
matter
from
what
dayspring
or
dawning
point
it
may
appear
the
phenomenal
sun
is
one
sun
if
tomorrow
it
should
rise
in
the
west
it
is
the
same
sun
we
cannot
say
this
is
not
the
sun
because
it
has
appeared
in
the
west
for
east
and
west
are
but
earthly
and
imaginary
directions
in
the
station
of
the
sun
there
is
neither
east
nor
west
it
is
ever
shining
from
its
place
in
the
heavens
in
the
focal
point
of
the
solar
circle
there
is
no
rising
no
setting
therefore
sunrise
and
sunset
have
relation
to
earthly
observation
and
not
to
the
luminary
itself
nay
rather
night
in
the
solar
orb
is
inconceivable
in
that
center
of
effulgence
constant
light
and
illumination
prevail
its
risings
and
settings
are
therefore
only
apparent
and
not
actual
they
have
relation
to
our
earthly
point
of
view
we
could
not
consider
it
the
sun
if
there
were
a
cessation
of
its
light
heat
and
splendor
to
do
so
would
be
equivalent
to
calling
a
black
stone
a
diamond
this
would
be
meaningless
if
a
man
is
a
miser
and
you
call
him
generous
it
will
produce
no
change
in
him
the
purport
of
this
is
that
god
is
almighty
but
his
greatness
cannot
be
brought
within
the
grasp
of
human
limitation
we
cannot
limit
god
to
a
boundary
man
is
limited
but
the
world
of
divinity
is
unlimited
prescribing
limitation
to
god
is
human
ignorance
god
is
the
ancient
the
almighty
his
attributes
are
infinite
he
is
god
because
his
light
his
sovereignty
is
infinite
if
he
can
be
limited
to
human
ideas
he
is
not
god
strange
it
is
that
notwithstanding
these
are
selfevident
truths
man
continues
to
build
walls
and
fences
of
limitation
about
god
about
divinity
so
glorious
illimitable
boundless
consider
the
endless
phenomena
of
his
creation
they
are
infinite
the
universe
is
infinite
who
shall
declare
its
height
its
depth
and
length
it
is
absolutely
infinite
how
could
an
almighty
sovereignty
a
divinity
so
wondrous
be
brought
within
the
limitations
of
faulty
human
minds
even
as
to
terms
and
definition
shall
we
then
say
that
god
has
performed
a
certain
thing
and
he
will
never
be
able
to
perform
it
again
that
the
sun
of
his
effulgence
once
shone
upon
the
world
but
now
has
set
forever
that
his
mercy
his
grace
his
bounty
once
descended
but
now
have
ceased
is
this
possible
no
we
can
never
say
nor
believe
with
truth
that
his
manifestation
the
adored
verity
the
sun
of
reality
shall
cease
to
shine
upon
the
world
o
god
thou
who
art
kind
verily
certain
souls
have
gathered
in
this
meeting
turning
to
thee
with
their
hearts
and
spirits
they
are
seeking
the
everlasting
bounty
they
are
in
need
of
thine
infinite
mercy
o
lord
remove
the
veils
from
their
eyes
and
dispel
the
darkness
of
ignorance
confer
upon
them
the
light
of
knowledge
and

o
thou
kind
god
in
the
utmost
state
of
humility
and
submission
do
we
entreat
and
supplicate
at
thy
threshold
seeking
thine
endless
confirmations
and
illimitable
assistance
o
thou
lord
regenerate
these
souls
and
confer
upon
them
a
new
life
animate
the
spirits
inform
the
hearts
open
the
eyes
and
make
the
ears
attentive
from
thine
ancient
treasury
confer
a
new
being
and
animus
and
from
thy
preexistent
abode
assist
them
to
attain
to
new
confirmations
o
god
verily
the
world
is
in
need
of
reformation
bestow
upon
it
a
new
existence
give
it
newness
of
thoughts
and
reveal
unto
it
heavenly
sciences
breathe
into
it
a
fresh
spirit
and
grant
unto
it
a
holier
and
higher
purpose
o
god
verily
thou
hast
made
this
century
radiant
and
in
it
thou
hast
manifested
thy
merciful
effulgence
thou
hast
effaced
the
darkness
of
superstitions
and
permitted
the
light
of
assurance
to
shine
o
god
grant
that
these
servants
may
be
acceptable
at
thy
threshold
reveal
a
new
heaven
and
spread
out
a
new
earth
for
habitation
let
a
new
jerusalem
descend
from
on
high
bestow
new
thoughts
new
life
upon
mankind
endow
souls
with
new
perceptions
and
confer
upon
them
new
virtues
verily
thou
art
the
almighty
the
powerful
thou
art
the
giver
the
generous
it
is
easy
to
bring
human
bodies
under
control
a
king
can
bring
under
his
rule
and
authority
the
bodies
of
his
subjects
throughout
a
whole
country
in
former
centuries
kings
and
rulers
have
absolutely
dominated
millions
of
men
and
have
been
thereby
enabled
to
carry
out
whatsoever
they
desire
if
they
willed
to
bestow
happiness
and
peace
they
could
do
so
and
if
they
determined
to
inflict
suffering
and
discomfort
they
were
equally
capable
if
they
desired
to
send
men
to
the
field
of
battle
none
could
oppose
their
authority
and
if
they
decreed
their
kingdoms
should
enjoy
the
bliss
and
serenity
of
immunity
from
war
this
condition
prevailed
in
a
word
kings
and
rulers
have
been
able
to
control
millions
of
human
beings
and
have
exercised
that
dominion
with
the
utmost
despotism
and
tyranny
the
point
is
this
that
to
gain
control
over
physical
bodies
is
an
extremely
easy
matter
but
to
bring
spirits
within
the
bonds
of
serenity
is
a
most
arduous
undertaking
this
is
not
the
work
of
everybody
it
necessitates
a
divine
and
holy
potency
the
potency
of
inspiration
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
for
example
christ
was
capable
of
leading
spirits
into
that
abode
of
serenity
he
was
capable
of
guiding
hearts
into
that
haven
of
rest
from
the
day
of
his
manifestation
to
the
present
time
he
has
been
resuscitating
hearts
and
quickening
spirits
he
has
exercised
that
vivifying
influence
in
the
realm
of
hearts
and
spirits
therefore
his
resuscitating
is
everlasting
in
this
century
of
the
latter
times
bahaullah
has
appeared
and
so
resuscitated
spirits
that
they
have
manifested
powers
more
than
human
thousands
of
his
followers
have
given
their
lives
and
while
under
the
sword
shedding
their
blood
they
have
proclaimed
ya
bahaulabha
such
resuscitation
is
impossible
except
through
a
heavenly
potency
a
supernatural
power
the
divine
power
of
the
holy
spirit
through
a
natural
and
mere
human
power
this
is
impossible
therefore
the
question
arises
how
is
this
resuscitation
to
be
accomplished
there
are
certain
means
for
its
accomplishment
by
which
mankind
is
regenerated
and
quickened
with
a
new
birth
this
is
the
second
birth
mentioned
in
the
heavenly
books
its
accomplishment
is
through
the
baptism
of
the
holy
spirit
the
resuscitation
or
rebirth
of
the
spirit
of
man
is
through
the
science
of
the
love
of
god
it
is
through
the
efficacy
of
the
water
of
life
this
life
and
quickening
is
the
regeneration
of
the
phenomenal
world
after
the
coming
of
the
spiritual
springtime
the
falling
of
the
vernal
showers
the
shining
of
the
sun
of
reality
the
blowing
of
the
breezes
of
perfection
all
phenomena
become
imbued
with
the
life
of
a
new
creation
and
are
reformed
in
the
process
of
a
new
genesis
reflect
upon
the
material
springtime
when
winter
comes
the
trees
are
leafless
the
fields
and
meadows
withered
the
flowers
die
away
into
dustheaps
in
prairie
mountain
and
garden
no
freshness
lingers
no
beauty
is
visible
no
verdure
can
be
seen
everything
is
clad
in
the
robe
of
death
wherever
you
look
around
you
will
find
the
expression
of
death
and
decay
but
when
the
spring
comes
the
showers
descend
the
sun
floods
the
meadows
and
plains
with
light
you
will
observe
creation
clad
in
a
new
robe
of
expression
the
showers
have
made
the
meadows
green
and
verdant
the
warm
breezes
have
caused
the
trees
to
put
on
their
garments
of
leaves
they
have
blossomed
and
soon
will
produce
new
fresh
and
delightful
fruits
everything
appears
endowed
with
a
newness
of
life
a
new
animus
and
spirit
is
everywhere
visible
the
spring
has
resuscitated
all
phenomena
and
has
adorned
the
earth
with
beauty
as
it
willeth
even
so
is
the
spiritual
springtime
when
it
comes
when
the
holy
divine
manifestations
or
prophets
appear
in
the
world
a
cycle
of
radiance
an
age
of
mercy
dawns
everything
is
renewed
minds
hearts
and
all
human
forces
are
reformed
perfections
are
quickened
sciences
discoveries
and
investigations
are
stimulated
afresh
and
everything
appertaining
to
the
virtues
of
the
human
world
is
revitalized
consider
this
present
century
of
radiance
and
compare
it
with
the
past
centuries
what
a
vast
difference
exists
between
them
how
minds
have
developed
how
perceptions
have
deepened
how
discoveries
have
increased
what
great
projects
have
been
accomplished
how
many
realities
have
become
manifest
how
many
mysteries
of
creation
have
been
probed
and
penetrated
what
is
the
cause
of
this
it
is
through
the
efficacy
of
the
spiritual
springtime
in
which
we
are
living
day
by
day
the
world
attains
a
new
bounty
in
this
radiant
century
neither
the
old
customs
nor
the
old
sciences
crafts
laws
and
regulations
have
remained
the
old
political
principles
are
undergoing
change
and
a
new
body
politic
is
in
process
of
formation
nevertheless
some
whose
thoughts
are
congealed
and
whose
souls
are
bereft
of
the
light
of
the
sun
of
reality
seek
to
arrest
this
development
in
the
world
of
the
minds
of
men
is
this
possible
in
the
unmistakable
and
universal
reformation
we
are
witnessing
when
outer
conditions
of
humanity
are
receiving
such
impetus
when
human
life
is
assuming
a
new
aspect
when
sciences
are
stimulated
afresh
inventions
and
discoveries
increasing
civic
laws
undergoing
change
and
moralities
evidencing
uplift
and
betterment
is
it
possible
that
spiritual
impulses
and
influences
should
not
be
renewed
and
reformed
naturally
new
spiritual
thoughts
and
inclinations
must
also
become
manifest
if
spirituality
be
not
renewed
what
fruits
come
from
mere
physical
reformation
for
instance
the
body
of
man
may
improve
the
quality
of
bone
and
sinew
may
advance
the
hand
may
develop
other
limbs
and
members
may
increase
in
excellence
but
if
the
mind
fails
to
develop
of
what
use
is
the
rest
the
important
factor
in
human
improvement
is
the
mind
in
the
world
of
the
mind
there
must
needs
be
development
and
improvement
there
must
be
reformation
in
the
kingdom
of
the
human
spirit
otherwise
no
result
will
be
attained
from
betterment
of
the
mere
physical
structure
in
this
new
year
new
fruits
must
be
forthcoming
for
that
is
the
provision
and
intention
of
spiritual
reformation
the
renewal
of
the
leaf
is
fruitless
from
the
reformation
of
bark
or
branch
no
fruit
will
come
forth
the
renewal
of
verdure
produces
nothing
if
there
be
no
renewal
of
fruit
from
the
tree
of
what
avail
is
the
reformation
of
bark
blossom
branch
and
trunk
for
a
fruitless
tree
is
of
no
special
value
similarly
of
what
avail
is
the
reformation
of
physical
conditions
unless
they
are
concomitant
with
spiritual
reformations
for
the
essential
reality
is
the
spirit
the
foundation
is
the
spirit
the
life
of
man
is
due
to
the
spirit
the
happiness
the
animus
the
radiance
the
glory
of
manall
are
due
to
the
spirit
and
if
in
the
spirit
no
reformation
takes
place
there
will
be
no
result
to
human
existence
therefore
we
must
strive
with
life
and
heart
that
the
material
and
physical
world
may
be
reformed
human
perception
become
keener
the
merciful
effulgence
manifest
and
the
radiance
of
reality
shine
then
the
star
of
love
shall
appear
and
the
world
of
humanity
become
illumined
the
purpose
is
that
the
world
of
existence
is
dependent
for
its
progress
upon
reformation
otherwise
it
will
be
as
dead
consider
if
a
new
springtime
failed
to
appear
what
would
be
the
effect
upon
this
globe
the
earth
undoubtedly
it
would
become
desolate
and
life
extinct
the
earth
has
need
of
an
annual
coming
of
spring
it
is
necessary
that
a
new
bounty
should
be
forthcoming
if
it
comes
not
life
would
be
effaced
in
the
same
way
the
world
of
spirit
needs
new
life
the
world
of
mind
necessitates
new
animus
and
development
the
world
of
souls
a
new
bounty
the
world
of
morality
a
reformation
the
world
of
divine
effulgence
ever
new
bestowals
were
it
not
for
this
replenishment
the
life
of
the
world
would
become
effaced
and
extinguished
if
this
room
is
not
ventilated
and
the
air
freshened
respiration
will
cease
after
a
length
of
time
if
no
rain
falls
all
life
organisms
will
perish
if
new
light
does
not
come
the
darkness
of
death
will
envelop
the
earth
if
a
new
springtime
does
not
arrive
life
upon
this
globe
will
be
obliterated
therefore
thoughts
must
be
lofty
and
ideals
uplifted
in
order
that
the
world
of
humanity
may
become
assisted
in
new
conditions
of
reform
when
this
reformation
affects
every
degree
then
will
come
the
very
day
of
the
lord
of
which
all
the
prophets
have
spoken
that
is
the
day
wherein
the
whole
world
will
be
regenerated
consider
are
the
laws
of
past
ages
applicable
to
present
human
conditions
evidently
they
are
not
for
example
the
laws
of
former
centuries
sanctioned
despotic
forms
of
government
are
the
laws
of
despotic
control
fitted
for
presentday
conditions
how
could
they
be
applied
to
solve
the
questions
surrounding
modern
nations
similarly
we
ask
would
the
status
of
ancient
thought
the
crudeness
of
arts
and
crafts
the
insufficiency
of
scientific
attainment
serve
us
today
would
the
agricultural
methods
of
the
ancients
suffice
in
the
twentieth
century
transportation
in
the
former
ages
was
restricted
to
conveyance
by
animals
how
would
it
provide
for
human
needs
today
if
modes
of
transportation
had
not
been
reformed
the
teeming
millions
now
upon
the
earth
would
die
of
starvation
without
the
railway
and
the
fastgoing
steamship
the
world
of
the
present
day
would
be
as
dead
how
could
great
cities
such
as
new
york
and
london
subsist
if
dependent
upon
ancient
means
of
conveyance
it
is
also
true
of
other
things
which
have
been
reformed
in
proportion
to
the
needs
of
the
present
time
had
they
not
been
reformed
man
could
not
find
subsistence
if
these
material
tendencies
are
in
such
need
of
reformation
how
much
greater
the
need
in
the
world
of
the
human
spirit
the
world
of
human
thought
perception
virtues
and
bounties
is
it
possible
that
that
need
has
remained
stationary
while
the
world
has
been
advancing
in
every
other
condition
and
direction
it
is
impossible
therefore
we
must
invoke
and
supplicate
god
and
strive
with
the
utmost
effort
in
order
that
the
world
of
human
existence
in
all
its
degrees
may
receive
a
mighty
impulse
complete
human
happiness
be
attained
and
the
resuscitation
of
all
spirits
and
emanations
be
realized
through
the
boundless
favor
of
the
mercy
of
god
august
talk
at
franklin
square
house
boston
massachusetts
notes
by
edna
mckinney
among
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
is
the
principle
of
equality
of
man
and
woman
bahaullah
has
said
that
both
belong
to
humankind
and
that
in
the
estimation
of
god
they
are
equal
for
each
is
the
complement
of
the
other
in
the
divine
creative
plan
the
only
distinction
between
them
in
the
sight
of
god
is
the
purity
and
righteousness
of
their
deeds
and
actions
for
that
one
is
preferred
by
god
who
is
most
nearly
in
the
spiritual
image
and
likeness
of
the
creator
throughout
the
kingdoms
of
living
organisms
there
is
sex
differentiation
in
function
but
no
preference
or
distinction
is
made
in
favor
of
either
male
or
female
in
the
animal
kingdom
individual
sex
exists
but
rights
are
equal
and
without
distinction
likewise
in
the
plane
or
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
sex
appears
but
equality
of
function
and
right
is
evident
inasmuch
as
sex
distinction
and
preference
are
not
observed
in
these
kingdoms
of
inferior
intelligence
is
it
befitting
the
superior
station
of
man
that
he
should
make
such
differentiation
and
estimate
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
difference
indicated
in
the
law
of
creation
in
ancient
times
and
medieval
ages
woman
was
completely
subordinated
to
man
the
cause
of
this
estimate
of
her
inferiority
was
her
lack
of
education
a
womans
life
and
intellect
were
limited
to
the
household
glimpses
of
this
may
be
found
even
in
the
epistles
of
saint
paul
in
later
centuries
the
scope
and
opportunities
of
a
womans
life
broadened
and
increased
her
mind
unfolded
and
developed
her
perceptions
awakened
and
deepened
the
question
concerning
her
was
why
should
a
woman
be
left
mentally
undeveloped
science
is
praiseworthywhether
investigated
by
the
intellect
of
man
or
woman
so
little
by
little
woman
advanced
giving
increasing
evidence
of
equal
capabilities
with
manwhether
in
scientific
research
political
ability
or
any
other
sphere
of
human
activity
the
conclusion
is
evident
that
woman
has
been
outdistanced
through
lack
of
education
and
intellectual
facilities
if
given
the
same
educational
opportunities
or
course
of
study
she
would
develop
the
same
capacity
and
abilities
there
are
some
who
declare
that
woman
is
not
naturally
endowed
or
imbued
with
the
same
capabilities
as
man
that
she
is
intellectually
inferior
to
man
weaker
in
willpower
and
lacking
his
courage
this
theory
is
completely
contradicted
by
history
and
facts
of
record
certain
women
of
superlative
capacity
and
determination
have
appeared
in
the
world
peers
of
man
in
intellect
and
equally
courageous
zenobia

in
ability
justness
and
equitable
administration
during
her
long
and
brilliant
reign
the
british
empire
was
immensely
extended
and
enriched
due
to
her
political
sagacity
skill
and
foresight
the
history
of
religion
likewise
furnishes
eloquent
examples
of
womans
capability
under
conditions
of
great
difficulty
and
necessity
the
conquest
of
the
holy
land
by
the
israelites
after
forty
years
wandering
in
the
desert
and
wilderness
of
judea
was
accomplished
through
the
strategy
and
cunning
of
a
woman
after
the
martyrdom
of
christ
to
whom
be
glory
the
disciples
were
greatly
disturbed
and
disheartened
even
peter
had
denied
christ
and
tried
to
shun
him
it
was
a
woman
mary
magdalene
who
confirmed
the
wavering
disciples
in
their
faith
saying
was
it
the
body
of
christ
or
the
reality
of
christ
that
ye
have
seen
crucified
surely
it
was
his
body
his
reality
is
everlasting
and
eternal
it
hath
neither
beginning
nor
ending
therefore
why
are
ye
perplexed
and
discouraged
christ
always
spoke
of
his
being
crucified
mary
magdalene
was
a
mere
villager
a
peasant
woman
yet
she
became
the
means
of
consolation
and
confirmation
to
the
disciples
of
christ
in
the
cause
of
bahaullah
there
have
been
women
who
were
superior
to
men
in
illumination
intellect
divine
virtues
and
devotion
to
god
among
them
was
qurratulayn
when
she
spoke
she
was
listened
to
reverently
by
the
most
learned
men
they
were
most
respectful
in
her
presence
and
none
dared
to
contradict
her
among
the
bahai
women
in
persia
today
there
are
ruhullah
and
others
who
are
gifted
with
knowledge
invincible
steadfastness
courage
virtue
and
power
of
will
they
are
superior
to
men
and
wellknown
throughout
persia
briefly
history
furnishes
evidence
that
during
the
past
centuries
there
have
been
great
women
as
well
as
great
men
but
in
general
owing
to
lack
of
educational
advantages
women
have
been
restricted
and
deprived
of
opportunity
to
become
fully
qualified
and
representative
of
humankind
when
given
the
opportunity
for
acquiring
education
they
have
shown
equal
capacity
with
men
some
philosophers
and
writers
have
considered
woman
naturally
and
by
creation
inferior
to
man
claiming
as
a
proof
that
the
brain
of
man
is
larger
and
heavier
than
that
of
woman
this
is
frail
and
faulty
evidence
inasmuch
as
small
brains
are
often
found
coupled
with
superior
intellect
and
large
brains
possessed
by
those
who
are
ignorant
even
imbecilic
the
truth
is
that
god
has
endowed
all
humankind
with
intelligence
and
perception
and
has
confirmed
all
as
his
servants
and
children
therefore
in
the
plan
and
estimate
of
god
there
is
no
distinction
between
male
or
female
the
soul
that
manifests
pure
deeds
and
spiritual
graces
is
most
precious
in
his
sight
and
nearer
to
him
in
its
attainments
the
realities
of
things
have
been
revealed
in
this
radiant
century
and
that
which
is
true
must
come
to
the
surface
among
these
realities
is
the
principle
of
the
equality
of
man
and
womanequal
rights
and
prerogatives
in
all
things
appertaining
to
humanity
bahaullah
declared
this
reality
over
fifty
years
ago
but
while
this
principle
of
equality
is
true
it
is
likewise
true
that
woman
must
prove
her
capacity
and
aptitude
must
show
forth
the
evidences
of
equality
she
must
become
proficient
in
the
arts
and
sciences
and
prove
by
her
accomplishments
that
her
abilities
and
powers
have
merely
been
latent
demonstrations
of
force
such
as
are
now
taking
place
in
england
are
neither
becoming
nor
effective
in
the
cause
of
womanhood
and
equality
woman
must
especially
devote
her
energies
and
abilities
toward
the
industrial
and
agricultural
sciences
seeking
to
assist
mankind
in
that
which
is
most
needful
by
this
means
she
will
demonstrate
capability
and
ensure
recognition
of
equality
in
the
social
and
economic
equation
undoubtedly
god
will
confirm
her
in
her
efforts
and
endeavors
for
in
this
century
of
radiance
bahaullah
has
proclaimed
the
reality
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
announced
that
all
nations
peoples
and
races
are
one
he
has
shown
that
although
individuals
may
differ
in
development
and
capacity
they
are
essentially
and
intrinsically
equal
as
human
beings
just
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
are
innumerable
and
different
but
the
reality
of
the
sea
is
one
the
plurality
of
humanity
may
be
likened
to
the
waves
but
the
reality
of
humankind
is
like
the
sea
itself
all
the
waves
are
of
the
same
water
all
are
waves
of
one
ocean
therefore
strive
to
show
in
the
human
world
that
women
are
most
capable
and
efficient
that
their
hearts
are
more
tender
and
susceptible
than
the
hearts
of
men
that
they
are
more
philanthropic
and
responsive
toward
the
needy
and
suffering
that
they
are
inflexibly
opposed
to
war
and
are
lovers
of
peace
strive
that
the
ideal
of
international
peace
may
become
realized
through
the
efforts
of
womankind
for
man
is
more
inclined
to
war
than
woman
and
a
real
evidence
of
womans
superiority
will
be
her
service
and
efficiency
in
the
establishment
of
universal
peace
august
talk
at
metaphysical
club
boston
massachusetts
notes
by
edna
mckinney
upon
the
faces
of
those
present
i
behold
the
expression
of
thoughtfulness
and
wisdom
therefore
i
shall
discourse
upon
a
subject
involving
one
of
the
divine
questions
a
question
of
religious
and
metaphysical
importancenamely
the
progressive
and
perpetual
motion
of
elemental
atoms
throughout
the
various
degrees
of
phenomena
and
the
kingdoms
of
existence
it
will
be
demonstrated
and
become
evident
that
the
origin
and
outcome
of
phenomena
are
identical
and
that
there
is
an
essential
oneness
in
all
existing
things
this
is
a
subtle
principle
appertaining
to
divine
philosophy
and
requiring
close
analysis
and
attention
the
elemental
atoms
which
constitute
all
phenomenal
existence
and
being
in
this
illimitable
universe
are
in
perpetual
motion
undergoing
continuous
degrees
of
progression
for
instance
let
us
conceive
of
an
atom
in
the
mineral
kingdom
progressing
upward
to
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
by
entering
into
the
composition
and
fibre
of
a
tree
or
plant
from
thence
it
is
assimilated
and
transferred
into
the
kingdom
of
the
animal
and
finally
by
the
law
and
process
of
composition
becomes
a
part
of
the
body
of
man
that
is
to
say
it
has
traversed
the
intermediate
degrees
and
stations
of
phenomenal
existence
entering
into
the
composition
of
various
organisms
in
its
journey
this
motion
or
transference
is
progressive
and
perpetual
for
after
disintegration
of
the
human
body
into
which
it
has
entered
it
returns
to
the
mineral
kingdom
whence
it
came
and
will
continue
to
traverse
the
kingdoms
of
phenomena
as
before
this
is
an
illustration
designed
to
show
that
the
constituent
elemental
atoms
of
phenomena
undergo
progressive
transference
and
motion
throughout
the
material
kingdoms
in
its
ceaseless
progression
and
journeyings
the
atom
becomes
imbued
with
the
virtues
and
powers
of
each
degree
or
kingdom
it
traverses
in
the
degree
of
the
mineral
it
possessed
mineral
affinities
in
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
it
manifested
the
augmentative
virtue
or
power
of
growth
in
the
animal
organism
it
reflected
the
intelligence
of
that
degree
and
in
the
kingdom
of
man
it
was
qualified
with
human
attributes
or
virtues
furthermore
the
forms
and
organisms
of
phenomenal
being
and
existence
in
each
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
universe
are
myriad
and
numberless
the
vegetable
plane
or
kingdom
for
instance
has
its
infinite
variety
of
types
and
material
structures
of
plant
lifeeach
distinct
and
different
within
itself
no
two
exactly
alike
in
composition
and
detailfor
there
are
no
repetitions
in
nature
and
the
augmentative
virtue
cannot
be
confined
to
any
given
image
or
shape
each
leaf
has
its
own
particular
identityso
to
speak
its
own
individuality
as
a
leaf
therefore
each
atom
of
the
innumerable
elemental
atoms
during
its
ceaseless
motion
through
the
kingdoms
of
existence
as
a
constituent
of
organic
composition
not
only
becomes
imbued
with
the
powers
and
virtues
of
the
kingdoms
it
traverses
but
also
reflects
the
attributes
and
qualities
of
the
forms
and
organisms
of
those
kingdoms
as
each
of
these
forms
has
its
individual
and
particular
virtue
therefore
each
elemental
atom
of
the
universe
has
the
opportunity
of
expressing
an
infinite
variety
of
those
individual
virtues
no
atom
is
bereft
or
deprived
of
this
opportunity
or
right
of
expression
nor
can
it
be
said
of
any
given
atom
that
it
is
denied
equal
opportunities
with
other
atoms
nay
all
are
privileged
to
possess
the
virtues
existent
in
these
kingdoms
and
to
reflect
the
attributes
of
their
organisms
in
the
various
transformations
or
passages
from
kingdom
to
kingdom
the
virtues
expressed
by
the
atoms
in
each
degree
are
peculiar
to
that
degree
for
example
in
the
world
of
the
mineral
the
atom
does
not
express
the
vegetable
form
and
organism
and
when
through
the
process
of
transmutation
it
assumes
the
virtues
of
the
vegetable
degree
it
does
not
reflect
the
attributes
of
animal
organisms
and
so
on
it
is
evident
then
that
each
elemental
atom
of
the
universe
is
possessed
of
a
capacity
to
express
all
the
virtues
of
the
universe
this
is
a
subtle
and
abstract
realization
meditate
upon
it
for
within
it
lies
the
true
explanation
of
pantheism
from
this
point
of
view
and
perception
pantheism
is
a
truth
for
every
atom
in
the
universe
possesses
or
reflects
all
the
virtues
of
life
the
manifestation
of
which
is
effected
through
change
and
transformation
therefore
the
origin
and
outcome
of
phenomena
is
verily
the
omnipresent
god
for
the
reality
of
all
phenomenal
existence
is
through
him
there
is
neither
reality
nor
the
manifestation
of
reality
without
the
instrumentality
of
god
existence
is
realized
and
possible
through
the
bounty
of
god
just
as
the
ray
or
flame
emanating
from
this
lamp
is
realized
through
the
bounty
of
the
lamp
from
which
it
originates
even
so
all
phenomena
are
realized
through
the
divine
bounty
and
the
explanation
of
true
pantheistic
statement
and
principle
is
that
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
find
realization
through
the
one
power
animating
and
dominating
all
things
and
all
things
are
but
manifestations
of
its
energy
and
bounty
the
virtue
of
being
and
existence
is
through
no
other
agency
therefore
in
the
words
of
bahaullah
the
first
teaching
is
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
when
the
man
who
is
spiritually
sagacious
and
possessed
of
insight
views
the
world
of
humanity
he
will
observe
that
the
lights
of
the
divine
bounty
are
flooding
all
mankind
just
as
the
lights
of
the
sun
shed
their
splendor
upon
all
existing
things
all
phenomena
of
material
existence
are
revealed
through
the
ray
emanating
from
the
sun
without
light
nothing
would
be
visible
similarly
all
phenomena
in
the
inner
world
of
reality
receive
the
bounties
of
god
from
the
source
of
divine
bestowal
this
human
plane
or
kingdom
is
one
creation
and
all
souls
are
the
signs
and
traces
of
the
divine
bounty
in
this
plane
there
are
no
exceptions
all
have
been
recipients
of
their
bestowals
through
the
heavenly
bounty
can
you
find
a
soul
bereft
of
the
nearness
of
god
can
you
find
one
whom
god
has
deprived
of
its
daily
sustenance
this
is
impossible
god
is
kind
and
loving
to
all
and
all
are
manifestations
of
the
divine
bounty
this
is
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
but
some
souls
are
weak
we
must
endeavor
to
strengthen
them
some
are
ignorant
uninformed
of
the
bounties
of
god
we
must
strive
to
make
them
knowing
some
are
ailing
we
must
seek
to
restore
them
to
health
some
are
immature
as
children
they
must
be
trained
and
assisted
to
attain
maturity
we
nurse
the
sick
in
tenderness
and
the
kindly
spirit
of
love
we
do
not
despise
them
because
they
are
ill
therefore
we
must
exercise
extreme
patience
sympathy
and
love
toward
all
mankind
considering
no
soul
as
rejected
if
we
look
upon
a
soul
as
rejected
we
have
disobeyed
the
teachings
of
god
god
is
loving
to
all
shall
we
be
unjust
or
unkind
to
anyone
is
this
allowable
in
the
sight
of
god
god
provides
for
all
is
it
befitting
for
us
to
prevent
the
flow
of
his
merciful
provisions
for
mankind
god
has
created
all
in
his
image
and
likeness
shall
we
manifest
hatred
for
his
creatures
and
servants
this
would
be
contrary
to
the
will
of
god
and
according
to
the
will
of
satan
by
which
we
mean
the
natural
inclinations
of
the
lower
nature
this
lower
nature
in
man
is
symbolized
as
satanthe
evil
ego
within
us
not
an
evil
personality
outside
bahaullah
teaches
that
the
foundations
of
the
divine
religion
are
one
reality
which
does
not
admit
of
multiplicity
or
division
therefore
the
commandments
and
teachings
of
god
are
one
the
religious
differences
and
divisions
which
exist
in
the
world
are
due
to
blind
imitations
of
forms
without
knowledge
or
investigation
of
the
fundamental
divine
reality
which
underlies
all
the
religions
inasmuch
as
these
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
are
various
dissensions
have
arisen
among
the
people
of
religion
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
free
mankind
from
this
subjection
to
blind
belief
by
pointing
the
way
of
guidance
to
reality
itself
which
is
the
only
basis
of
unity
bahaullah
says
that
religion
must
be
conducive
to
love
and
unity
if
it
proves
to
be
the
source
of
hatred
and
enmity
its
absence
is
preferable
for
the
will
and
law
of
god
is
love
and
love
is
the
bond
between
human
hearts
religion
is
the
light
of
the
world
if
it
is
made
the
cause
of
darkness
through
human
misunderstanding
and
ignorance
it
would
be
better
to
do
without
it
religion
must
conform
to
science
and
reason
otherwise
it
is
superstition
god
has
created
man
in
order
that
he
may
perceive
the
verity
of
existence
and
endowed
him
with
mind
or
reason
to
discover
truth
therefore
scientific
knowledge
and
religious
belief
must
be
conformable
to
the
analysis
of
this
divine
faculty
in
man
prejudices
of
all
kindswhether
religious
racial
patriotic
or
politicalare
destructive
of
divine
foundations
in
man
all
the
warfare
and
bloodshed
in
human
history
have
been
the
outcome
of
prejudice
this
earth
is
one
home
and
native
land
god
has
created
mankind
with
equal
endowment
and
right
to
live
upon
the
earth
as
a
city
is
the
home
of
all
its
inhabitants
although
each
may
have
his
individual
place
of
residence
therein
so
the
earths
surface
is
one
wide
native
land
or
home
for
all
races
of
humankind
racial
prejudice
or
separation
into
nations
such
as
french
german
american
and
so
on
is
unnatural
and
proceeds
from
human
motive
and
ignorance
all
are
the
children
and
servants
of
god
why
should
we
be
separated
by
artificial
and
imaginary
boundaries
in
the
animal
kingdom
the
doves
flock
together
in
harmony
and
agreement
they
have
no
prejudices
we
are
human
and
superior
in
intelligence
is
it
befitting
that
lower
creatures
should
manifest
virtues
which
lack
expression
in
man
bahaullah
has
proclaimed
and
promulgated
the
foundation
of
international
peace
for
thousands
of
years
men
and
nations
have
gone
forth
to
the
battlefield
to
settle
their
differences
the
cause
of
this
has
been
ignorance
and
degeneracy
praise
be
to
god
in
this
radiant
century
minds
have
developed
perceptions
have
become
keener
eyes
are
illumined
and
ears
attentive
therefore
it
will
be
impossible
for
war
to
continue
consider
human
ignorance
and
inconsistency
a
man
who
kills
another
man
is
punished
by
execution
but
a
military
genius
who
kills
one
hundred
thousand
of
his
fellow
creatures
is
immortalized
as
a
hero
one
man
steals
a
small
sum
of
money
and
is
imprisoned
as
a
thief
another
pillages
a
whole
country
and
is
honored
as
a
patriot
and
conqueror
a
single
falsehood
brings
reproach
and
censure
but
the
wiles
of
politicians
and
diplomats
excite
the
admiration
and
praise
of
a
nation
consider
the
ignorance
and
inconsistency
of
mankind
how
darkened
and
savage
are
the
instincts
of
humanity
bahaullah
has
announced
that
no
matter
how
far
the
world
of
humanity
may
advance
in
material
civilization
it
is
nevertheless
in
need
of
spiritual
virtues
and
the
bounties
of
god
the
spirit
of
man
is
not
illumined
and
quickened
through
material
sources
it
is
not
resuscitated
by
investigating
phenomena
of
the
world
of
matter
the
spirit
of
man
is
in
need
of
the
protection
of
the
holy
spirit
just
as
he
advances
by
progressive
stages
from
the
mere
physical
world
of
being
into
the
intellectual
realm
so
must
he
develop
upward
in
moral
attributes
and
spiritual
graces
in
the
process
of
this
attainment
he
is
ever
in
need
of
the
bestowals
of
the
holy
spirit
material
development
may
be
likened
to
the
glass
of
a
lamp
whereas
divine
virtues
and
spiritual
susceptibilities
are
the
light
within
the
glass
the
lamp
chimney
is
worthless
without
the
light
likewise
man
in
his
material
condition
requires
the
radiance
and
vivification
of
the
divine
graces
and
merciful
attributes
without
the
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
he
is
lifeless
although
physically
and
mentally
alive
he
is
spiritually
dead
christ
announced
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
meaning
that
man
must
be
born
again
as
the
babe
is
born
into
the
light
of
this
physical
world
so
must
the
physical
and
intellectual
man
be
born
into
the
light
of
the
world
of
divinity
in
the
matrix
of
the
mother
the
unborn
child
was
deprived
and
unconscious
of
the
world
of
material
existence
but
after
its
birth
it
beheld
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
a
new
realm
of
life
and
being
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
it
was
utterly
ignorant
and
unable
to
conceive
of
these
new
conditions
but
after
its
transformation
it
discovers
the
radiant
sun
trees
flowers
and
an
infinite
range
of
blessings
and
bounties
awaiting
it
in
the
human
plane
and
kingdom
man
is
a
captive
of
nature
and
ignorant
of
the
divine
world
until
born
of
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
out
of
physical
conditions
of
limitation
and
deprivation
then
he
beholds
the
reality
of
the
spiritual
realm
and
kingdom
realizes
the
narrow
restrictions
of
the
mere
human
world
of
existence
and
becomes
conscious
of
the
unlimited
and
infinite
glories
of
the
world
of
god
therefore
no
matter
how
man
may
advance
upon
the
physical
and
intellectual
plane
he
is
ever
in
need
of
the
boundless
virtues
of
divinity
the
protection
of
the
holy
spirit
and
the
face
of
god

notes
by
edna
mckinney
in
the
books
of
the
prophets
certain
glad
tidings
are
recorded
which
are
absolutely
true
and
free
from
doubt
the
east
has
ever
been
the
dawning
point
of
the
sun
of
reality
all
the
prophets
of
god
have
appeared
there
the
religions
of
god
have
been
promulgated
the
teachings
of
god
have
been
spread
and
the
law
of
god
founded
in
the
east
the
orient
has
always
been
the
center
of
lights
the
west
has
acquired
illumination
from
the
east
but
in
some
respects
the
reflection
of
the
light
has
been
greater
in
the
occident
this
is
especially
true
of
christianity
christ
appeared
in
palestine
and
his
teachings
were
founded
there
although
the
doors
of
the
kingdom
were
opened
in
that
country
and
the
bestowals
of
divinity
were
spread
broadcast
from
its
center
the
people
of
the
west
have
embraced
and
promulgated
christianity
more
fully
than
those
in
the
east
the
sun
of
reality
shone
forth
from
the
horizon
of
the
east
but
its
heat
and
ray
are
most
resplendent
in
the
west
where
the
radiant
standard
of
christ
has
been
upraised
i
have
great
hopes
that
the
lights
of
bahaullahs
appearance
may
also
find
the
fullest
manifestation
and
reflection
in
these
western
regions
for
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
are
especially
applicable
to
the
conditions
of
the
people
here
the
western
nations
are
endowed
with
the
capability
of
understanding
the
rational
and
peerless
words
of
bahaullah
and
realizing
that
the
essence
of
the
teachings
of
all
the
former
prophets
can
be
found
in
his
utterance
the
teachings
of
christ
have
been
promulgated
by
bahaullah
who
has
also
revealed
new
teachings
applicable
to
present
conditions
in
the
world
of
humanity
he
has
trained
the
people
of
the
east
through
the
power
and
protection
of
the
holy
spirit
cemented
the
souls
of
humanity
together
and
established
the
foundations
of
international
unity
through
the
power
of
his
words
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
all
religions
have
been
attuned
in
harmony
for
instance
among
the
bahais
in
persia
there
are
christians
muslims
zoroastrians
jews
and
many
others
of
varying
denominations
and
beliefs
who
have
been
brought
together
in
unity
and
love
in
the
cause
of
bahaullah
although
these
people
were
formerly
hostile
and
antagonistic
filled
with
hatred
and
bitterness
toward
each
other
bloodthirsty
and
pillaging
considering
that
animosity
and
attack
were
the
means
of
attaining
the
good
pleasure
of
god
they
have
now
become
loving
and
filled
with
the
radiant
zeal
of
fellowship
and
brotherhood
the
purpose
of
them
all
being
service
to
the
world
of
humanity
promotion
of
international
peace
the
unification
of
the
divine
religions
and
deeds
of
universal
philanthropy
by
their
words
and
actions
they
are
proving
the
verity
of
bahaullah
consider
the
animosity
and
hatred
existing
today
between
the
various
nations
of
the
world
what
disagreements
and
hostilities
arise
what
warfare
and
contention
how
much
bloodshed
what
injustice
and
tyranny
just
now
there
is
war
in
eastern
turkey
also
war
between
turkey
and
italy
nations
are
devoted
to
conquest
and
bloodshed
filled
with
the
animus
of
religious
hatred
seeking
the
good
pleasure
of
god
by
killing
and
destroying
those
whom
in
their
blindness
they
consider
enemies
how
ignorant
they
are
that
which
is
forbidden
by
god
they
consider
acceptable
to
him
god
is
love
god
seeketh
fellowship
purity
sanctity
and
longsuffering
these
are
the
attributes
of
divinity
therefore
these
warring
raging
nations
have
arisen
against
divinity
imagining
they
are
serving
god
what
gross
ignorance
this
is
what
injustice
blindness
and
lack
of
realization
briefly
we
must
strive
with
heart
and
soul
in
order
that
this
darkness
of
the
contingent
world
may
be
dispelled
that
the
lights
of
the
kingdom
shall
shine
upon
all
the
horizons
the
world
of
humanity
become
illumined
the
image
of
god
become
apparent
in
human
mirrors
the
law
of
god
be
well
established
and
that
all
regions
of
the
world
shall
enjoy
peace
comfort
and
composure
beneath
the
equitable
protection
of
god
my
admonition
and
exhortation
to
you
is
this
be
kind
to
all
people
love
humanity
consider
all
mankind
as
your
relations
and
servants
of
the
most
high
god
strive
day
and
night
that
animosity
and
contention
may
pass
away
from
the
hearts
of
men
that
all
religions
shall
become
reconciled
and
the
nations
love
each
other
so
that
no
racial
religious
or
political
prejudice
may
remain
and
the
world
of
humanity
behold
god
as
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
existence
god
has
created
all
and
all
return
to
god
therefore
love
humanity
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
if
you
meet
a
poor
man
assist
him
if
you
see
the
sick
heal
him
reassure
the
affrighted
one
render
the
cowardly
noble
and
courageous
educate
the
ignorant
associate
with
the
stranger
emulate
god
consider
how
kindly
how
lovingly
he
deals
with
all
and
follow
his
example
you
must
treat
people
in
accordance
with
the
divine
preceptsin
other
words
treat
them
as
kindly
as
god
treats
them
for
this
is
the
greatest
attainment
possible
for
the
world
of
humanity
furthermore
know
ye
that
god
has
created
in
man
the
power
of
reason
whereby
man
is
enabled
to
investigate
reality
god
has
not
intended
man
to
imitate
blindly
his
fathers
and
ancestors
he
has
endowed
him
with
mind
or
the
faculty
of
reasoning
by
the
exercise
of
which
he
is
to
investigate
and
discover
the
truth
and
that
which
he
finds
real
and
true
he
must
accept
he
must
not
be
an
imitator
or
blind
follower
of
any
soul
he
must
not
rely
implicitly
upon
the
opinion
of
any
man
without
investigation
nay
each
soul
must
seek
intelligently
and
independently
arriving
at
a
real
conclusion
and
bound
only
by
that
reality
the
greatest
cause
of
bereavement
and
disheartening
in
the
world
of
humanity
is
ignorance
based
upon
blind
imitation
it
is
due
to
this
that
wars
and
battles
prevail
from
this
cause
hatred
and
animosity
arise
continually
among
mankind
through
failure
to
investigate
reality
the
jews
rejected
jesus
christ
they
were
expecting
his
coming
by
day
and
night
they
mourned
and
lamented
saying
o
god
hasten
thou
the
day
of
the
advent
of
christ
expressing
most
intense
longing
for
the
messiah
but
when
christ
appeared
they
denied
and
rejected
him
treated
him
with
arrogant
contempt
sentenced
him
to
death
and
finally
crucified
him
why
did
this
happen
because
they
were
blindly
following
imitations
believing
that
which
had
descended
to
them
as
a
heritage
from
their
fathers
and
ancestors
tenaciously
holding
to
it
and
refusing
to
investigate
the
reality
of
christ
therefore
they
were
deprived
of
the
bounties
of
christ
whereas
if
they
had
forsaken
imitations
and
investigated
the
reality
of
the
messiah
they
would
have
surely
been
guided
to
believing
in
him
instead
of
this
they
said
we
have
heard
from
our
fathers
and
have
read
in
the
old
testament
that
christ
must
come
from
an
unknown
place
now
we
find
that
this
one
has
come
from
nazareth
steeped
in
the
literal
interpretation
and
imitating
the
beliefs
of
fathers
and
ancestors
they
failed
to
understand
the
fact
that
although
the
body
of
jesus
came
from
nazareth
the
reality
of
the
christ
came
from
the
unknown
place
of
the
divine
kingdom
they
also
said
that
the
scepter
of
christ
would
be
of
ironthat
is
to
say
he
should
wield
a
sword
when
christ
appeared
he
did
possess
a
sword
but
it
was
the
sword
of
his
tongue
with
which
he
separated
the
false
from
the
true
but
the
jews
were
blind
to
the
spiritual
significance
and
symbolism
of
the
prophetic
words
they
also
expected
that
the
messiah
would
sit
upon
the
throne
of
david
whereas
christ
had
neither
throne
nor
semblance
of
sovereignty
nay
rather
he
was
a
poor
man
apparently
abject
and
vanquished
therefore
how
could
he
be
the
veritable
christ
this
was
one
of
their
most
insistent
objections
based
upon
ancestral
interpretation
and
teaching
in
reality
christ
was
glorified
with
an
eternal
sovereignty
and
everlasting
dominionspiritual
and
not
temporal
his
throne
and
kingdom
were
established
in
human
hearts
where
he
reigns
with
power
and
authority
without
end
notwithstanding
the
fulfillment
of
all
the
prophetic
signs
in
christ
the
jews
denied
him
and
entered
the
period
of
their
deprivation
because
of
their
allegiance
to
imitations
and
ancestral
forms
among
other
objections
they
said
we
are
promised
through
the
tongue
of
the
prophets
that
christ
at
the
time
of
his
coming
would
proclaim
the
law
of
the
torah
whereas
now
we
see
this
person
abrogating
the
commands
of
the
pentateuch
disturbing
our
blessed
sabbath
and
abolishing
the
law
of
divorce
he
has
left
nothing
of
the
ancient
law
of
moses
therefore
he
is
the
enemy
of
moses
in
reality
christ
proclaimed
and
completed
the
law
of
moses
he
was
the
very
helper
and
assister
of
moses
he
spread
the
book
of
moses
throughout
the
world
and
established
anew
the
fundamentals
of
the
law
revealed
by
him
he
abolished
certain
unimportant
laws
and
forms
which
were
no
longer
compatible
with
the
exigencies
of
the
time
such
as
divorce
and
plurality
of
wives
the
jews
did
not
comprehend
this
and
the
cause
of
their
ignorance
was
blind
and
tenacious
adherence
to
imitations
of
ancient
forms
and
teachings
therefore
they
finally
sentenced
christ
to
death
they
likewise
said
through
the
tongues
of
the
prophets
it
was
announced
that
during
the
time
of
christs
appearance
the
justice
of
god
would
prevail
throughout
the
world
tyranny
and
oppression
would
be
unknown
justice
would
even
extend
to
the
animal
kingdom
ferocious
beasts
would
associate
in
gentleness
and
peace
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
would
drink
from
the
same
spring
the
lion
and
the
deer
meet
in
the
same
meadow
the
eagle
and
quail
dwell
together
in
the
same
nest
but
instead
of
this
we
see
that
during
the
time
of
this
supposed
christ
the
romans
have
conquered
palestine
and
are
ruling
it
with
extreme
tyranny
justice
is
nowhere
apparent
and
signs
of
peace
in
the
animal
kingdom
are
conspicuously
absent
these
statements
and
attitudes
of
the
jews
were
inherited
from
their
fathersblind
allegiance
to
literal
expectations
which
did
not
come
to
pass
during
the
time
of
jesus
christ
the
real
purport
of
these
prophetic
statements
was
that
various
peoples
symbolized
by
the
wolf
and
lamb
between
whom
love
and
fellowship
were
impossible
would
come
together
during
the
messiahs
reign
drink
from
the
same
fountain
of
life
in
his
teachings
and
become
his
devoted
followers
this
was
realized
when
peoples
of
all
religions
nationalities
and
dispositions
became
united
in
their
beliefs
and
followed
christ
in
humility
associating
in
love
and
brotherhood
under
the
shadow
of
his
divine
protection
the
jews
being
blind
to
this
and
holding
to
their
bigoted
imitations
were
insolent
and
arrogant
toward
christ
and
crucified
him
had
they
investigated
the
reality
of
christ
they
would
have
beheld
his
beauty
and
truth
god
has
given
man
the
eye
of
investigation
by
which
he
may
see
and
recognize
truth
he
has
endowed
man
with
ears
that
he
may
hear
the
message
of
reality
and
conferred
upon
him
the
gift
of
reason
by
which
he
may
discover
things
for
himself
this
is
his
endowment
and
equipment
for
the
investigation
of
reality
man
is
not
intended
to
see
through
the
eyes
of
another
hear
through
anothers
ears
nor
comprehend
with
anothers
brain
each
human
creature
has
individual
endowment
power
and
responsibility
in
the
creative
plan
of
god
therefore
depend
upon
your
own
reason
and
judgment
and
adhere
to
the
outcome
of
your
own
investigation
otherwise
you
will
be
utterly
submerged
in
the
sea
of
ignorance
and
deprived
of
all
the
bounties
of
god
turn
to
god
supplicate
humbly
at
his
threshold
seeking
assistance
and
confirmation
that
god
may
rend
asunder
the
veils
that
obscure
your
vision
then
will
your
eyes
be
filled
with
illumination
face
to
face
you
will
behold
the
reality
of
god
and
your
heart
become
completely
purified
from
the
dross
of
ignorance
reflecting
the
glories
and
bounties
of
the
kingdom
holy
souls
are
like
soil
which
has
been
plowed
and
tilled
with
much
earnest
labor
the
thorns
and
thistles
cast
aside
and
all
weeds
uprooted
such
soil
is
most
fruitful
and
the
harvest
from
it
will
prove
full
and
plenteous
in
this
same
way
man
must
free
himself
from
the
weeds
of
ignorance
thorns
of
superstitions
and
thistles
of
imitations
that
he
may
discover
reality
in
the
harvests
of
true
knowledge
otherwise
the
discovery
of
reality
is
impossible
contention
and
divergence
of
religious
belief
will
always
remain
and
mankind
like
ferocious
wolves
will
rage
and
attack
each
other
in
hatred
and
antagonism
we
supplicate
god
that
he
may
destroy
the
veils
which
limit
our
vision
and
that
these
becloudings
which
darken
the
way
of
the
manifestation
of
the
shining
lights
may
be
dispelled
in
order
that
the
effulgent
sun
of
reality
may
shine
forth
we
implore
and
invoke
god
seeking
his
assistance
and
confirmation
man
is
a
child
of
god
most
noble
lofty
and
beloved
by
god
his
creator
therefore
he
must
ever
strive
that
the
divine
bounties
and
virtues
bestowed
upon
him
may
prevail
and
control
him
just
now
the
soil
of
human
hearts
seems
like
black
earth
but
in
the
innermost
substance
of
this
dark
soil
there
are
thousands
of
fragrant
flowers
latent
we
must
endeavor
to
cultivate
and
awaken
these
potentialities
discover
the
secret
treasure
in
this
very
mine
and
depository
of
god
bring
forth
these
resplendent
powers
long
hidden
in
human
hearts
then
will
the
glories
of
both
worlds
be
blended
and
increased
and
the
quintessence
of
human
existence
be
made
manifest
we
must
not
be
content
with
simply
following
a
certain
course
because
we
find
our
fathers
pursued
that
course
it
is
the
duty
of
everyone
to
investigate
reality
and
investigation
of
reality
by
another
will
not
do
for
us
if
all
in
the
world
were
rich
and
one
man
poor
of
what
use
are
these
riches
to
that
man
if
all
the
world
be
virtuous
and
a
man
steeped
in
vice
what
good
results
are
forthcoming
from
him
if
all
the
world
be
resplendent
and
a
man
blind
where
are
his
benefits
if
all
the
world
be
in
plenty
and
a
man
hungry
what
sustenance
does
he
derive
therefore
every
man
must
be
an
investigator
for
himself
ideas
and
beliefs
left
by
his
fathers
and
ancestors
as
a
heritage
will
not
suffice
for
adherence
to
these
are
but
imitations
and
imitations
have
ever
been
a
cause
of
disappointment
and
misguidance
be
investigators
of
reality
that
you
may
attain
the
verity
of
truth
and
life
you
have
asked
why
it
was
necessary
for
the
soul
that
was
from
god
to
make
this
journey
back
to
god
would
you
like
to
understand
the
reality
of
this
question
just
as
i
teach
it
or
do
you
wish
to
hear
it
as
the
world
teaches
it
for
if
i
should
answer
you
according
to
the
latter
way
this
would
be
but
imitation
and
would
not
make
the
subject
clear
the
reality
underlying
this
question
is
that
the
evil
spirit
satan
or
whatever
is
interpreted
as
evil
refers
to
the
lower
nature
in
man
this
baser
nature
is
symbolized
in
various
ways
in
man
there
are
two
expressions
one
is
the
expression
of
nature
the
other
the
expression
of
the
spiritual
realm
the
world
of
nature
is
defective
look
at
it
clearly
casting
aside
all
superstition
and
imagination
if
you
should
leave
a
man
uneducated
and
barbarous
in
the
wilds
of
africa
would
there
be
any
doubt
about
his
remaining
ignorant
god
has
never
created
an
evil
spirit
all
such
ideas
and
nomenclature
are
symbols
expressing
the
mere
human
or
earthly
nature
of
man
it
is
an
essential
condition
of
the
soil
of
earth
that
thorns
weeds
and
fruitless
trees
may
grow
from
it
relatively
speaking
this
is
evil
it
is
simply
the
lower
state
and
baser
product
of
nature
it
is
evident
therefore
that
man
is
in
need
of
divine
education
and
inspiration
that
the
spirit
and
bounties
of
god
are
essential
to
his
development
that
is
to
say
the
teachings
of
christ
and
the
prophets
are
necessary
for
his
education
and
guidance
why
because
they
are
the
divine
gardeners
who
till
the
earth
of
human
hearts
and
minds
they
educate
man
uproot
the
weeds
burn
the
thorns
and
remodel
the
waste
places
into
gardens
and
orchards
where
fruitful
trees
grow
the
wisdom
and
purpose
of
their
training
is
that
man
must
pass
from
degree
to
degree
of
progressive
unfoldment
until
perfection
is
attained
for
instance
if
a
man
should
live
his
entire
life
in
one
city
he
cannot
gain
a
knowledge
of
the
whole
world
to
become
perfectly
informed
he
must
visit
other
cities
see
the
mountains
and
valleys
cross
the
rivers
and
traverse
the
plains
in
other
words
without
progressive
and
universal
education
perfection
will
not
be
attained
man
must
walk
in
many
paths
and
be
subjected
to
various
processes
in
his
evolution
upward
physically
he
is
not
born
in
full
stature
but
passes
through
consecutive
stages
of
fetus
infant
childhood
youth
maturity
and
old
age
suppose
he
had
the
power
to
remain
young
throughout
his
life
he
then
would
not
understand
the
meaning
of
old
age
and
could
not
believe
it
existed
if
he
could
not
realize
the
condition
of
old
age
he
would
not
know
that
he
was
young
he
would
not
know
the
difference
between
young
and
old
without
experiencing
the
old
unless
you
have
passed
through
the
state
of
infancy
how
would
you
know
this
was
an
infant
beside
you
if
there
were
no
wrong
how
would
you
recognize
the
right
if
it
were
not
for
sin
how
would
you
appreciate
virtue
if
evil
deeds
were
unknown
how
could
you
commend
good
actions
if
sickness
did
not
exist
how
would
you
understand
health
evil
is
nonexistent
it
is
the
absence
of
good
sickness
is
the
loss
of
health
poverty
the
lack
of
riches
when
wealth
disappears
you
are
poor
you
look
within
the
treasure
box
but
find
nothing
there
without
knowledge
there
is
ignorance
therefore
ignorance
is
simply
the
lack
of
knowledge
death
is
the
absence
of
life
therefore
on
the
one
hand
we
have
existence
on
the
other
nonexistence
negation
or
absence
of
existence
briefly
the
journey
of
the
soul
is
necessary
the
pathway
of
life
is
the
road
which
leads
to
divine
knowledge
and
attainment
without
training
and
guidance
the
soul
could
never
progress
beyond
the
conditions
of
its
lower
nature
which
is
ignorant
and
defective

from
stenographic
notes
god
the
almighty
has
created
all
mankind
from
the
dust
of
earth
he
has
fashioned
them
all
from
the
same
elements
they
are
descended
from
the
same
race
and
live
upon
the
same
globe
he
has
created
them
to
dwell
beneath
the
one
heaven
as
members
of
the
human
family
and
his
children
he
has
endowed
them
with
equal
susceptibilities
he
maintains
protects
and
is
kind
to
all
he
has
made
no
distinction
in
mercies
and
graces
among
his
children
with
impartial
love
and
wisdom
he
has
sent
forth
his
prophets
and
divine
teachings
his
teachings
are
the
means
of
establishing
union
and
fellowship
among
mankind
and
awakening
love
and
kindness
in
human
hearts
he
proclaims
the
oneness
of
the
kingdom
of
humanity
he
rebukes
those
things
which
create
differences
and
destroy
harmony
he
commends
and
praises
every
means
that
will
conduce
to
the
solidarity
of
the
human
race
he
encourages
man
in
every
step
of
advancement
which
leads
to
ultimate
union
the
prophets
of
god
have
been
inspired
with
the
message
of
love
and
unity
the
books
of
god
have
been
revealed
for
the
upbuilding
of
fellowship
and
union
the
prophets
of
god
have
been
the
servants
of
reality
their
teachings
constitute
the
science
of
reality
reality
is
one
it
does
not
admit
plurality
we
conclude
therefore
that
the
foundation
of
the
religions
of
god
is
one
foundation
notwithstanding
this
certain
forms
and
imitations
have
been
persistently
adhered
to
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
foundation
of
the
teachings
of
the
prophets
of
god
as
these
imitations
are
various
and
different
contention
and
strife
prevail
among
the
people
of
religious
beliefs
and
the
foundation
of
the
religion
of
god
has
become
obscured
like
beasts
of
prey
men
are
warring
and
killing
each
other
destroying
cities
and
homes
devastating
countries
and
kingdoms
god
has
created
his
servants
in
order
that
they
may
love
and
associate
with
each
other
he
has
revealed
the
glorious
splendor
of
his
sun
of
love
in
the
world
of
humanity
the
cause
of
the
creation
of
the
phenomenal
world
is
love
all
the
prophets
have
promulgated
the
law
of
love
man
has
opposed
the
will
of
god
and
acted
in
opposition
to
the
plan
of
god
therefore
from
the
beginning
of
history
to
the
present
time
the
world
of
humanity
has
had
no
lasting
rest
warfare
and
strife
have
continuously
prevailed
and
hearts
have
manifested
hatred
toward
each
other
the
cause
of
bloodshed
and
battle
strife
and
hatred
throughout
the
past
has
been
either
religious
racial
patriotic
or
political
prejudice
therefore
the
world
of
humanity
has
ever
been
in
torment
these
prejudices
are
more
pronounced
in
the
orient
where
freedom
is
restricted
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
nations
of
the
east
were
restless
and
in
a
state
of
inner
commotion
the
darkness
of
imitations
and
forms
had
enveloped
religious
belief
the
people
of
religions
were
in
constant
warfare
filled
with
enmity
hatred
and
bitterness
in
the
midst
of
these
conditions
bahaullah
appeared
he
proclaimed
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
announced
that
all
are
the
servants
of
god
he
taught
that
all
the
religions
are
beneath
the
shadow
and
protection
of
the
almighty
that
god
is
compassionate
and
loving
to
all
that
the
revelations
of
all
the
prophets
of
the
past
have
been
in
perfect
unity
and
agreement
that
the
heavenly
books
have
confirmed
each
other
therefore
why
should
contention
and
strife
exist
among
the
people
as
all
mankind
have
been
created
by
the
one
god
we
are
sheep
under
the
care
and
protection
of
one
shepherd
therefore
as
his
sheep
we
must
associate
in
accord
and
agreement
if
one
single
lamb
becomes
separated
from
the
flock
the
thoughts
and
efforts
of
all
the
others
must
be
to
bring
it
back
again
consequently
bahaullah
proclaimed
that
inasmuch
as
god
is
the
one
heavenly
shepherd
and
all
mankind
are
the
sheep
of
his
fold
the
religion
or
guidance
of
god
must
be
the
means
of
love
and
fellowship
in
the
world
if
religion
proves
to
be
the
source
of
hatred
enmity
and
contention
if
it
becomes
the
cause
of
warfare
and
strife
and
influences
men
to
kill
each
other
its
absence
is
preferable
for
that
which
is
productive
of
hatred
amongst
the
people
is
rejected
by
god
and
that
which
establishes
fellowship
is
beloved
and
sanctioned
by
him
religion
and
divine
teachings
are
like
unto
a
remedy
a
remedy
must
produce
the
condition
of
health
if
it
occasions
sickness
it
is
wiser
and
better
to
have
no
remedy
whatever
this
is
the
significance
of
the
statement
that
if
religion
becomes
the
cause
of
warfare
and
bloodshed
irreligion
and
the
absence
of
religion
are
preferable
among
mankind
bahaullah
has
declared
that
religion
must
be
in
accord
with
science
and
reason
if
it
does
not
correspond
with
scientific
principles
and
the
processes
of
reason
it
is
superstition
for
god
has
endowed
us
with
faculties
by
which
we
may
comprehend
the
realities
of
things
contemplate
reality
itself
if
religion
is
opposed
to
reason
and
science
faith
is
impossible
and
when
faith
and
confidence
in
the
divine
religion
are
not
manifest
in
the
heart
there
can
be
no
spiritual
attainment
according
to
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
all
religious
racial
patriotic
and
political
prejudice
must
be
abandoned
for
these
are
the
destroyers
of
the
real
foundation
of
humanity
he
has
announced
that
the
religion
of
god
is
one
for
all
revelations
of
it
are
based
upon
reality
abraham
summoned
the
people
to
reality
moses
proclaimed
reality
christ
founded
reality
likewise
all
the
prophets
were
the
servants
and
promulgators
of
reality
reality
is
one
and
indivisible
therefore
the
prejudices
and
bigotries
which
exist
today
among
the
religions
are
not
justifiable
inasmuch
as
they
are
opposed
to
reality
all
prejudices
are
against
the
will
and
plan
of
god
consider
for
instance
racial
distinction
and
enmity
all
humanity
are
the
children
of
god
they
belong
to
the
same
family
to
the
same
original
race
there
can
be
no
multiplicity
of
races
since
all
are
the
descendants
of
adam
this
signifies
that
racial
assumption
and
distinction
are
nothing
but
superstition
in
the
estimate
of
god
there
are
no
english
french
germans
turkish
or
persians
all
these
in
the
presence
of
god
are
equal
they
are
of
one
race
and
creation
god
did
not
make
these
divisions
these
distinctions
have
had
their
origin
in
man
himself
therefore
as
they
are
against
the
plan
and
purpose
of
reality
they
are
false
and
imaginary
we
are
of
one
physical
race
even
as
we
are
of
one
physical
plan
of
material
bodyeach
endowed
with
two
eyes
two
ears
one
head
two
feet
among
the
animals
racial
prejudice
does
not
exist
consider
the
doves
there
is
no
distinction
as
to
whether
it
is
an
oriental
or
an
occidental
dove
the
sheep
are
all
of
one
race
there
is
no
assumption
of
distinction
between
an
eastern
and
a
western
sheep
when
they
meet
they
associate
with
perfect
fellowship
if
a
dove
from
the
west
should
go
to
the
orient
it
will
associate
with
the
eastern
doves
unhesitatingly
there
will
be
no
attitude
of
unwillingness
as
if
saying
you
belong
to
the
east
i
am
from
the
west
is
it
reasonable
or
allowable
that
a
racial
prejudice
which
is
not
observed
by
the
animal
kingdom
should
be
entertained
by
man
consider
the
prejudice
of
patriotism
this
is
one
globe
one
land
one
country
god
did
not
divide
it
into
national
boundaries
he
created
all
the
continents
without
national
divisions
why
should
we
make
such
division
ourselves
these
are
but
imaginary
lines
and
boundaries
europe
is
a
continent
it
is
not
naturally
divided
man
has
drawn
the
lines
and
established
the
limits
of
kingdoms
and
empires
man
declares
a
river
to
be
a
boundary
line
between
two
countries
calling
this
side
french
and
the
other
side
german
whereas
the
river
was
created
for
both
and
is
a
natural
artery
for
all
is
it
not
imagination
and
ignorance
which
impels
man
to
violate
the
divine
intention
and
make
the
very
bounties
of
god
the
cause
of
war
bloodshed
and
destruction
therefore
all
prejudices
between
man
and
man
are
falsehoods
and
violations
of
the
will
of
god
god
desires
unity
and
love
he
commands
harmony
and
fellowship
enmity
is
human
disobedience
god
himself
is
love
bahaullah
has
announced
that
inasmuch
as
ignorance
and
lack
of
education
are
barriers
of
separation
among
mankind
all
must
receive
training
and
instruction
through
this
provision
the
lack
of
mutual
understanding
will
be
remedied
and
the
unity
of
mankind
furthered
and
advanced
universal
education
is
a
universal
law
it
is
therefore
incumbent
upon
every
father
to
teach
and
instruct
his
children
according
to
his
possibilities
if
he
is
unable
to
educate
them
the
body
politic
the
representative
of
the
people
must
provide
the
means
for
their
education
in
the
orient
women
were
degraded
and
considered
subordinate
to
man
bahaullah
proclaimed
equality
of
the
sexesthat
both
man
and
woman
are
servants
of
god
before
whom
there
is
no
distinction
whosoever
has
a
pure
heart
and
renders
good
deeds
is
nearer
to
god
and
the
object
of
his
favorwhether
man
or
woman
the
sex
distinction
which
exists
in
the
human
world
is
due
to
the
lack
of
education
for
woman
who
has
been
denied
equal
opportunity
for
development
and
advancement
equality
of
the
sexes
will
be
established
in
proportion
to
the
increased
opportunities
afforded
woman
in
this
age
for
man
and
woman
are
equally
the
recipients
of
powers
and
endowments
from
god
the
creator
god
has
not
ordained
distinction
between
them
in
his
consummate
purpose
bahaullah
has
proclaimed
the
adoption
of
a
universal
language
a
language
shall
be
agreed
upon
by
which
unity
will
be
established
in
the
world
each
person
will
require
training
in
two
languages
his
native
tongue
and
the
universal
auxiliary
form
of
speech
this
will
facilitate
intercommunication
and
dispel
the
misunderstandings
which
the
barriers
of
language
have
occasioned
in
the
world
all
people
worship
the
same
god
and
are
alike
his
servants
when
they
are
able
to
communicate
freely
they
will
associate
in
friendship
and
concord
entertain
the
greatest
love
and
fellowship
for
each
other
and
in
reality
the
orient
and
occident
will
embrace
in
unity
and
agreement
the
world
is
in
greatest
need
of
international
peace
until
it
is
established
mankind
will
not
attain
composure
and
tranquillity
it
is
necessary
that
the
nations
and
governments
organize
an
international
tribunal
to
which
all
their
disputes
and
differences
shall
be
referred
the
decision
of
that
tribunal
shall
be
final
individual
controversy
will
be
adjudged
by
a
local
tribunal
international
questions
will
come
before
the
universal
tribunal
and
so
the
cause
of
warfare
will
be
taken
away
fifty
years
ago
bahaullah
wrote
epistles
to
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
world
in
which
the
teachings
and
principles
revealed
by
him
were
embodied
and
set
forth
these
epistles
were
printed
in
india
forty
years
ago
and
spread
broadcast
briefly
by
the
promulgation
of
these
principles
bahaullah
has
caused
the
prejudices
which
afflicted
the
people
of
the
orient
to
disappear
the
communities
which
have
accepted
his
teachings
are
now
living
together
in
the
greatest
love
and
harmony
when
you
enter
a
meeting
of
these
people
you
will
find
christians
jews
muslims
zoroastrians
buddhists
gathered
together
in
perfect
fellowship
and
agreement
in
their
discussions
the
greatest
spirit
of
tolerance
and
friendship
has
supplanted
the
former
hostility
and
hatred
witnessed
among
them
i
have
visited
america
and
find
everywhere
the
evidences
of
just
and
equitable
government
therefore
i
pray
god
that
these
western
peoples
may
become
the
means
of
establishing
international
peace
and
spreading
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
may
you
become
the
cause
of
unity
and
agreement
among
the
nations
may
a
lamp
be
lighted
here
which
will
illumine
the
whole
universe
with
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
with
love
between
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
and
the
unity
of
all
mankind
i
hope
that
you
may
become
assisted
in
this
supreme
accomplishment
that
you
may
raise
the
flag
of
international
peace
and
reconciliation
upon
this
continent
that
this
government
and
people
may
be
the
means
of
spreading
these
lofty
ideals
in
order
that
the
world
of
man
may
find
rest
in
order
that
the
good
pleasure

from
stenographic
notes
i
am
exceedingly
happy
to
meet
you
praise
be
to
god
i
see
before
me
souls
who
have
unusual
capability
and
the
power
of
spiritual
advancement
in
reality
the
people
of
this
continent
possess
great
capacity
they
are
the
cause
of
my
happiness
and
i
ever
pray
that
god
may
confirm
and
assist
them
to
progress
in
all
the
degrees
of
existence
as
they
have
advanced
along
material
lines
may
they
develop
in
idealistic
degrees
for
material
advancement
is
fruitless
without
spiritual
progress
and
not
productive
of
everlasting
results
for
example
no
matter
how
much
the
physical
body
of
man
is
trained
and
developed
there
will
be
no
real
progression
in
the
human
station
unless
the
mind
correspondingly
advances
no
matter
how
much
man
may
acquire
material
virtues
he
will
not
be
able
to
realize
and
express
the
highest
possibilities
of
life
without
spiritual
graces
god
has
created
all
earthly
things
under
a
law
of
progression
in
material
degrees
but
he
has
created
man
and
endowed
him
with
powers
of
advancement
toward
spiritual
and
transcendental
kingdoms
he
has
not
created
material
phenomena
after
his
own
image
and
likeness
but
he
has
created
man
after
that
image
and
with
potential
power
to
attain
that
likeness
he
has
distinguished
man
above
all
other
created
things
all
created
things
except
man
are
captives
of
nature
and
the
sense
world
but
in
man
there
has
been
created
an
ideal
power
by
which
he
may
perceive
intellectual
or
spiritual
realities
he
has
brought
forth
everything
necessary
for
the
life
of
this
world
but
man
is
a
creation
intended
for
the
reflection
of
divine
virtues
consider
that
the
highest
type
of
creation
below
man
is
the
animal
which
is
superior
to
all
degrees
of
life
except
man
manifestly
the
animal
has
been
created
for
the
life
of
this
world
its
highest
virtue
is
to
express
excellence
in
the
material
plane
of
existence
the
animal
is
perfect
when
its
body
is
healthy
and
its
physical
senses
are
whole
when
it
is
characterized
by
the
attributes
of
physical
health
when
its
physical
forces
are
in
working
order
when
food
and
surrounding
conditions
minister
to
its
needs
it
has
attained
the
ultimate
perfection
of
its
kingdom
but
man
does
not
depend
upon
these
things
for
his
virtues
no
matter
how
perfect
his
health
and
physical
powers
if
that
is
all
he
has
not
yet
risen
above
the
degree
of
a
perfect
animal
beyond
and
above
this
god
has
opened
the
doors
of
ideal
virtues
and
attainments
before
the
face
of
man
he
has
created
in
his
being
the
mysteries
of
the
divine
kingdom
he
has
bestowed
upon
him
the
power
of
intellect
so
that
through
the
attribute
of
reason
when
fortified
by
the
holy
spirit
he
may
penetrate
and
discover
ideal
realities
and
become
informed
of
the
mysteries
of
the
world
of
significances
as
this
power
to
penetrate
the
ideal
knowledges
is
superhuman
supernatural
man
becomes
the
collective
center
of
spiritual
as
well
as
material
forces
so
that
the
divine
spirit
may
manifest
itself
in
his
being
the
effulgences
of
the
kingdom
shine
within
the
sanctuary
of
his
heart
the
signs
of
the
attributes
and
perfections
of
god
reveal
themselves
in
a
newness
of
life
the
everlasting
glory
and
eternal
existence
be
attained
the
knowledge
of
god
illumine
and
the
mysteries
of
the
realm
of
might
be
unsealed
man
is
like
unto
this
lamp
but
the
effulgences
of
the
kingdom
are
like
the
rays
of
the
lamp
man
is
like
unto
the
glass
but
spiritual
splendors
are
like
unto
the
light
within
the
glass
no
matter
how
translucent
the
glass
may
be
as
long
as
there
is
no
light
within
it
remains
dark
likewise
man
no
matter
how
much
he
advances
in
material
accomplishments
will
remain
like
the
glass
without
light
if
he
is
deprived
of
the
spiritual
virtues
material
virtues
are
like
unto
a
perfect
body
but
this
body
is
in
need
of
the
spirit
no
matter
how
handsome
and
perfect
the
body
may
be
if
it
is
deprived
of
the
spirit
and
its
animus
it
is
dead
but
when
that
same
body
is
affiliated
with
the
spirit
and
expressing
life
perfection
and
virtue
become
realized
in
it
deprived
of
the
holy
spirit
and
its
bounties
man
is
spiritually
dead
children
for
instance
no
matter
how
good
and
pure
no
matter
how
healthy
their
bodies
are
nevertheless
considered
imperfect
because
the
power
of
intellect
is
not
fully
manifest
in
them
when
the
intellectual
power
fully
displays
its
influences
and
they
attain
to
the
age
of
maturity
they
are
considered
as
perfect
likewise
man
no
matter
how
much
he
may
advance
in
worldly
affairs
and
make
progress
in
material
civilization
is
imperfect
unless
he
is
quickened
by
the
bounties
of
the
holy
spirit
for
it
is
evident
that
until
he
receives
that
divine
impetus
he
is
ignorant
and
deprived
for
this
reason
jesus
christ
said
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
cannot
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
by
this
christ
meant
that
unless
man
is
released
from
the
material
world
freed
from
the
captivity
of
materialism
and
receiving
a
portion
of
the
bounties
of
the
spiritual
world
he
shall
be
deprived
of
the
bestowals
and
favors
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
utmost
we
can
say
of
him
is
that
he
is
a
perfect
animal
no
one
can
rightly
call
him
a
man
in
another
place
he
said
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
the
meaning
of
this
is
that
if
man
is
a
captive
of
nature
he
is
like
unto
an
animal
because
he
is
only
a
body
physically
bornthat
is
he
belongs
to
the
world
of
matter
and
remains
subject
to
the
law
and
control
of
nature
but
if
he
is
baptized
with
the
holy
spirit
if
he
is
freed
from
the
bondage
of
nature
released
from
animalistic
tendencies
and
advanced
in
the
human
realm
he
is
fitted
to
enter
into
the
divine
kingdom
the
world
of
the
kingdom
is
the
realm
of
divine
bestowals
and
the
bounties
of
god
it
is
attainment
of
the
highest
virtues
of
humanity
it
is
nearness
to
god
it
is
capacity
to
receive
the
bounties
of
the
ancient
lord
when
man
advances
to
this
station
he
attains
the
second
birth
before
his
first
or
physical
birth
man
was
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
he
had
no
knowledge
of
this
world
his
eyes
could
not
see
his
ears
could
not
hear
when
he
was
born
from
the
world
of
the
matrix
he
beheld
another
world
the
sun
was
shining
with
its
splendors
the
moon
radiant
in
the
heavens
the
stars
twinkling
in
the
expansive
firmament
the
seas
surging
trees
verdant
and
green
all
kinds
of
creatures
enjoying
life
here
infinite
bounties
prepared
for
him
in
the
world
of
the
matrix
none
of
these
things
existed
in
that
world
he
had
no
knowledge
of
this
vast
range
of
existence
nay
rather
he
would
have
denied
the
reality
of
this
world
but
after
his
birth
he
began
to
open
his
eyes
and
behold
the
wonders
of
this
illimitable
universe
similarly
as
long
as
man
is
in
the
matrix
of
the
human
world
as
long
as
he
is
the
captive
of
nature
he
is
out
of
touch
and
without
knowledge
of
the
universe
of
the
kingdom
if
he
attains
rebirth
while
in
the
world
of
nature
he
will
become
informed
of
the
divine
world
he
will
observe
that
another
and
a
higher
world
exists
wonderful
bounties
descend
eternal
life
awaits
everlasting
glory
surrounds
him
all
the
signs
of
reality
and
greatness
are
there
he
will
see
the
lights
of
god
all
these
experiences
will
be
his
when
he
is
born
out
of
the
world
of
nature
into
the
divine
world
therefore
for
the
perfect
man
there
are
two
kinds
of
birth
the
first
physical
birth
is
from
the
matrix
of
the
mother
the
second
or
spiritual
birth
is
from
the
world
of
nature
in
both
he
is
without
knowledge
of
the
new
world
of
existence
he
is
entering
therefore
rebirth
means
his
release
from
the
captivity
of
nature
freedom
from
attachment
to
this
mortal
and
material
life
this
is
the
second
or
spiritual
birth
of
which
jesus
christ
spoke
in
the
gospels
the
majority
of
people
are
captives
in
the
matrix
of
nature
submerged
in
the
sea
of
materiality
we
must
pray
that
they
may
be
reborn
that
they
may
attain
insight
and
spiritual
hearing
that
they
may
receive
the
gift
of
another
heart
a
new
transcendent
power
and
in
the
eternal
world
the
unending
bestowal
of
divine
bounties
today
the
world
of
humanity
is
walking
in
darkness
because
it
is
out
of
touch
with
the
world
of
god
that
is
why
we
do
not
see
the
signs
of
god
in
the
hearts
of
men
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
has
no
influence
when
a
divine
spiritual
illumination
becomes
manifest
in
the
world
of
humanity
when
divine
instruction
and
guidance
appear
then
enlightenment
follows
a
new
spirit
is
realized
within
a
new
power
descends
and
a
new
life
is
given
it
is
like
the
birth
from
the
animal
kingdom
into
the
kingdom
of
man
when
man
acquires
these
virtues
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
will
be
revealed
the
banner
of
international
peace
will
be
upraised
equality
between
all
mankind
will
be
realized
and
the
orient
and
occident
will
become
one
then
will
the
justice
of
god
become
manifest
all
humanity
will
appear
as
the
members
of
one
family
and
every
member
of
that
family
will
be
consecrated
to
cooperation
and
mutual
assistance
the
lights
of
the
love
of
god
will
shine
eternal
happiness
will
be
unveiled
everlasting
joy
and
spiritual
delight
will
be
attained
i
will
pray
and
you
must
pray
likewise
that
such
heavenly
bounty
may
be
realized
that
strife
and
enmity
may
be
banished
warfare
and
bloodshed
taken
away
that
hearts
may
attain
ideal
communication
and
that
all
people
may
drink
from
the
same
fountain
may
they
receive
their
knowledge
from
the
same
divine
source
may
all
hearts
become
illumined
with
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
may
all
of
them
enter
the
university
of
god
acquire
spiritual
virtues
and
seek
for
themselves
heavenly
bounties
then
this
material
phenomenal
world
will
become
the
mirror
of
the
world
of
god
and
within
this
pure
mirror
the
divine
virtues
of
the
realm
of
might
will
be
reflected
september
talk
at
home
of
mr
and
mrs
william
sutherland
maxwell
pine
avenue
west
montreal
canada
from
stenographic
notes
the
subject
of
immortality
has
been
suggested
life
is
the
expression
of
composition
and
death
the
expression
of
decomposition
in
the
world
or
kingdom
of
the
minerals
certain
materials
or
elemental
substances
exist
when
through
the
law
of
creation
they
enter
into
composition
a
being
or
organism
comes
into
existence
for
example
certain
material
atoms
are
brought
together
and
man
is
the
result
when
this
composition
is
destroyed
and
disintegrated
decomposition
takes
place
this
is
mortality
or
death
when
certain
elements
are
composed
an
animal
comes
into
being
when
these
elements
are
scattered
or
decomposed
this
is
called
the
death
of
the
animal
again
certain
atoms
are
bound
together
by
chemical
affinity
a
composition
called
a
flower
appears
when
these
atoms
are
dispersed
and
the
composition
they
have
formed
is
disintegrated
the
flower
has
come
to
its
end
it
is
dead
therefore
it
is
evident
that
life
is
the
expression
of
composition
and
mortality
or
death
is
equivalent
to
decomposition
as
the
spirit
of
man
is
not
composed
of
material
elements
it
is
not
subject
to
decomposition
and
therefore
has
no
death
it
is
selfevident
that
the
human
spirit
is
simple
single
and
not
composed
in
order
that
it
may
come
to
immortality
and
it
is
a
philosophical
axiom
that
the
individual
or
indivisible
atom
is
indestructible
at
most
it
passes
through
a
process
of
construction
and
reconstruction
for
example
these
individual
atoms
are
brought
together
in
a
composition
and
through
this
composition
a
given
organismsuch
as
a
man
an
animal
or
a
plantis
created
when
this
composition
is
decomposed
that
created
organism
is
brought
to
an
end
but
the
component
atoms
are
not
annihilated
they
continue
to
exist
because
they
are
single
individual
and
not
composed
therefore
it
may
be
said
that
these
individual
atoms
are
eternal
likewise
the
human
spirit
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
composed
of
individual
elements
or
atomsas
it
is
sanctified
above
these
elementsis
eternal
this
is
a
selfevident
proof
of
its
immortality
second
consider
the
world
of
dreams
wherein
the
body
of
man
is
immovable
seemingly
dead
not
subject
to
sensation
the
eyes
do
not
see
the
ears
do
not
hear
nor
the
tongue
speak
but
the
spirit
of
man
is
not
asleep
it
sees
hears
moves
perceives
and
discovers
realities
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
spirit
of
man
is
not
affected
by
the
change
or
condition
of
the
body
even
though
the
material
body
should
die
the
spirit
continues
eternally
alive
just
as
it
exists
and
functions
in
the
inert
body
in
the
realm
of
dreams
that
is
to
say
the
spirit
is
immortal
and
will
continue
its
existence
after
the
destruction
of
the
body
third
the
human
body
has
one
form
in
its
composition
it
has
been
transferred
from
one
form
to
another
but
never
possesses
two
forms
at
the
same
time
for
example
it
has
existed
in
the
elemental
substances
of
the
mineral
kingdom
from
the
mineral
kingdom
it
has
traversed
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
its
constituent
substances
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
it
has
risen
by
evolution
into
the
kingdom
of
the
animal
and
from
thence
attained
the
kingdom
of
man
after
its
disintegration
and
decomposition
it
will
return
again
to
the
mineral
kingdom
leaving
its
human
form
and
taking
a
new
form
unto
itself
during
these
progressions
one
form
succeeds
another
but
at
no
time
does
the
body
possess
more
than
one
the
spirit
of
man
however
can
manifest
itself
in
all
forms
at
the
same
time
for
example
we
say
that
a
material
body
is
either
square
or
spherical
triangular
or
hexagonal
while
it
is
triangular
it
cannot
be
square
and
while
it
is
square
it
is
not
triangular
similarly
it
cannot
be
spherical
and
hexagonal
at
the
same
time
these
various
forms
or
shapes
cannot
be
manifest
at
the
same
instant
in
one
material
object
therefore
the
form
of
the
physical
body
of
man
must
be
destroyed
and
abandoned
before
it
can
assume
or
take
unto
itself
another
mortality
therefore
means
transference
from
one
form
to
anotherthat
is
transference
from
the
human
kingdom
to
the
kingdom
of
the
mineral
when
the
physical
man
is
dead
he
will
return
to
dust
and
this
transference
is
equivalent
to
nonexistence
but
the
human
spirit
in
itself
contains
all
these
forms
shapes
and
figures
it
is
not
possible
to
break
or
destroy
one
form
so
that
it
may
transfer
itself
into
another
as
an
evidence
of
this
at
the
present
moment
in
the
human
spirit
you
have
the
shape
of
a
square
and
the
figure
of
a
triangle
simultaneously
also
you
can
conceive
a
hexagonal
form
all
these
can
be
conceived
at
the
same
moment
in
the
human
spirit
and
not
one
of
them
needs
to
be
destroyed
or
broken
in
order
that
the
spirit
of
man
may
be
transferred
to
another
there
is
no
annihilation
no
destruction
therefore
the
human
spirit
is
immortal
because
it
is
not
transferred
from
one
body
into
another
body
consider
another
proof
every
cause
is
followed
by
an
effect
and
vice
versa
there
could
be
no
effect
without
a
cause
preceding
it
sight
is
an
effect
there
is
no
doubt
that
behind
that
effect
there
is
a
cause
when
we
hear
a
discourse
there
is
a
speaker
we
could
not
hear
words
unless
they
proceeded
from
the
tongue
of
a
speaker
motion
without
a
mover
or
cause
of
motion
is
inconceivable
jesus
christ
lived
two
thousand
years
ago
today
we
behold
his
manifest
signs
his
light
is
shining
his
sovereignty
is
established
his
traces
are
apparent
his
bounties
are
effulgent
can
we
say
that
christ
did
not
exist
we
can
absolutely
conclude
that
christ
existed
and
that
from
him
these
traces
proceeded
still
another
proof
the
body
of
man
becomes
lean
or
fat
it
is
afflicted
with
disease
suffers
mutilation
perhaps
the
eyes
become
blind
the
ears
deaf
but
none
of
these
imperfections
and
failings
afflict
or
affect
the
spirit
the
spirit
of
man
remains
in
the
same
condition
unchanged
a
man
is
blinded
but
his
spirit
continues
the
same
he
loses
his
hearing
his
hand
is
cut
off
his
foot
amputated
but
his
spirit
remains
the
same
he
becomes
lethargic
he
is
afflicted
with
apoplexy
but
there
is
no
difference
change
or
alteration
in
his
spirit
this
is
proof
that
death
is
only
destruction
of
the
body
while
the
spirit
remains
immortal
eternal
again
all
phenomena
of
the
material
world
are
subject
to
mortality
and
death
but
the
immortal
spirit
does
not
belong
to
the
phenomenal
world
it
is
holy
and
sanctified
above
material
existence
if
the
spirit
of
man
belonged
to
the
elemental
existence
the
eye
could
see
it
the
ear
hear
it
the
hand
touch
as
long
as
these
five
senses
cannot
perceive
it
the
proof
is
unquestioned
that
it
does
not
belong
to
the
elemental
world
and
therefore
is
beyond
death
or
mortality
which
are
inseparable
from
that
material
realm
of
existence
if
being
is
not
subject
to
the
limitation
of
material
life
it
is
not
subject
to
mortality
there
are
many
other
proofs
of
the
immortality
of
the
spirit
of
man
these
are
but
a
few
of
them

from
stenographic
notes
nature
is
the
material
world
when
we
look
upon
it
we
see
that
it
is
dark
and
imperfect
for
instance
if
we
allow
a
piece
of
land
to
remain
in
its
natural
condition
we
will
find
it
covered
with
thorns
and
thistles
useless
weeds
and
wild
vegetation
will
flourish
upon
it
and
it
will
become
like
a
jungle
the
trees
will
be
fruitless
lacking
beauty
and
symmetry
wild
animals
noxious
insects
and
reptiles
will
abound
in
its
dark
recesses
this
is
the
incompleteness
and
imperfection
of
the
world
of
nature
to
change
these
conditions
we
must
clear
the
ground
and
cultivate
it
so
that
flowers
may
grow
instead
of
thorns
and
weedsthat
is
to
say
we
must
illumine
the
dark
world
of
nature
in
their
primal
natural
state
the
forests
are
dim
gloomy
impenetrable
man
opens
them
to
the
light
clears
away
the
tangled
underbrush
and
plants
fruitful
trees
soon
the
wild
woodlands
and
jungle
are
changed
into
productive
orchards
and
beautiful
gardens
order
has
replaced
chaos
the
dark
realm
of
nature
has
become
illumined
and
brightened
by
cultivation
if
man
himself
is
left
in
his
natural
state
he
will
become
lower
than
the
animal
and
continue
to
grow
more
ignorant
and
imperfect
the
savage
tribes
of
central
africa
are
evidences
of
this
left
in
their
natural
condition
they
have
sunk
to
the
lowest
depths
and
degrees
of
barbarism
dimly
groping
in
a
world
of
mental
and
moral
obscurity
if
we
wish
to
illumine
this
dark
plane
of
human
existence
we
must
bring
man
forth
from
the
hopeless
captivity
of
nature
educate
him
and
show
him
the
pathway
of
light
and
knowledge
until
uplifted
from
his
condition
of
ignorance
he
becomes
wise
and
knowing
no
longer
savage
and
revengeful
he
becomes
civilized
and
kind
once
evil
and
sinister
he
is
endowed
with
the
attributes
of
heaven
but
left
in
his
natural
condition
without
education
and
training
it
is
certain
that
he
will
become
more
depraved
and
vicious
than
the
animal
even
to
the
extreme
degree
witnessed
among
african
tribes
who
practice
cannibalism
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
world
of
nature
is
incomplete
imperfect
until
awakened
and
illumined
by
the
light
and
stimulus
of
education
in
these
days
there
are
new
schools
of
philosophy
blindly
claiming
that
the
world
of
nature
is
perfect
if
this
is
true
why
are
children
trained
and
educated
in
schools
and
what
is
the
need
of
extended
courses
in
sciences
arts
and
letters
in
colleges
and
universities
what
would
be
the
result
if
humanity
were
left
in
its
natural
condition
without
education
or
training
all
scientific
discoveries
and
attainments
are
the
outcomes
of
knowledge
and
education
the
telegraph
phonograph
telephone
were
latent
and
potential
in
the
world
of
nature
but
would
never
have
come
forth
into
the
realm
of
visibility
unless
man
through
education
had
penetrated
and
discovered
the
laws
which
control
them
all
the
marvelous
developments
and
miracles
of
what
we
call
civilization
would
have
remained
hidden
unknown
and
so
to
speak
nonexistent
if
man
had
remained
in
his
natural
condition
deprived
of
the
bounties
blessings
and
benefits
of
education
and
mental
culture
the
intrinsic
difference
between
the
ignorant
man
and
the
astute
philosopher
is
that
the
former
has
not
been
lifted
out
of
his
natural
condition
while
the
latter
has
undergone
systematic
training
and
education
in
schools
and
colleges
until
his
mind
has
awakened
and
unfolded
to
higher
realms
of
thought
and
perception
otherwise
both
are
human
and
natural
god
has
sent
forth
the
prophets
for
the
purpose
of
quickening
the
soul
of
man
into
higher
and
divine
recognitions
he
has
revealed
the
heavenly
books
for
this
great
purpose
for
this
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
have
been
wafted
through
the
gardens
of
human
hearts
the
doors
of
the
divine
kingdom
opened
to
mankind
and
the
invisible
inspirations
sent
forth
from
on
high
this
divine
and
ideal
power
has
been
bestowed
upon
man
in
order
that
he
may
purify
himself
from
the
imperfections
of
nature
and
uplift
his
soul
to
the
realm
of
might
and
power
god
has
purposed
that
the
darkness
of
the
world
of
nature
shall
be
dispelled
and
the
imperfect
attributes
of
the
natal
self
be
effaced
in
the
effulgent
reflection
of
the
sun
of
truth
the
mission
of
the
prophets
of
god
has
been
to
train
the
souls
of
humanity
and
free
them
from
the
thralldom
of
natural
instincts
and
physical
tendencies
they
are
like
unto
gardeners
and
the
world
of
humanity
is
the
field
of
their
cultivation
the
wilderness
and
untrained
jungle
growth
wherein
they
proceed
to
labor
they
cause
the
crooked
branches
to
become
straightened
the
fruitless
trees
to
become
fruitful
and
gradually
transform
this
great
wild
uncultivated
field
into
a
beautiful
orchard
producing
wonderful
abundance
and
outcome
if
the
world
of
nature
were
perfect
and
complete
in
itself
there
would
be
no
need
of
such
training
and
cultivation
in
the
human
worldno
need
of
teachers
schools
and
universities
arts
and
crafts
the
revelations
of
the
prophets
of
god
would
not
have
been
necessary
and
the
heavenly
books
would
have
been
superfluous
if
the
world
of
nature
were
perfect
and
sufficient
for
mankind
we
would
have
no
need
of
god
and
our
belief
in
him
therefore
the
bestowal
of
all
these
great
helps
and
accessories
to
the
attainment
of
divine
life
is
because
the
world
of
nature
is
incomplete
and
imperfect
consider
this
canadian
country
during
the
early
history
of
montreal
when
the
land
was
in
its
wild
uncultivated
and
natural
condition
the
soil
was
unproductive
rocky
and
almost
uninhabitablevast
forests
stretching
in
every
direction
what
invisible
power
caused
this
great
metropolis
to
spring
up
amid
such
savage
and
forbidding
conditions
it
was
the
human
mind
therefore
nature
and
the
effect
of
natures
laws
were
imperfect
the
mind
of
man
remedied
and
removed
this
imperfect
condition
until
now
we
behold
a
great
city
instead
of
a
savage
unbroken
wilderness
before
the
coming
of
columbus
america
itself
was
a
wild
uncultivated
expanse
of
primeval
forest
mountains
and
riversa
very
world
of
nature
now
it
has
become
the
world
of
man
it
was
dark
forbidding
and
savage
now
it
has
become
illumined
with
a
great
civilization
and
prosperity
instead
of
forests
we
behold
productive
farms
beautiful
gardens
and
prolific
orchards
instead
of
thorns
and
useless
vegetation
we
find
flowers
domestic
animals
and
fields
awaiting
harvest
if
the
world
of
nature
were
perfect
the
condition
of
this
great
country
would
have
been
left
unchanged
if
a
child
is
left
in
its
natural
state
and
deprived
of
education
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
will
grow
up
in
ignorance
and
illiteracy
its
mental
faculties
dulled
and
dimmed
in
fact
it
will
become
like
an
animal
this
is
evident
among
the
savages
of
central
africa
who
are
scarcely
higher
than
the
beast
in
mental
development
the
conclusion
is
irresistible
that
the
splendors
of
the
sun
of
truth
the
word
of
god
have
been
the
source
and
cause
of
human
upbuilding
and
civilization
the
world
of
nature
is
the
kingdom
of
the
animal
in
its
natural
condition
and
plane
of
limitation
the
animal
is
perfect
the
ferocious
beasts
of
prey
have
been
completely
subject
to
the
laws
of
nature
in
their
development
they
are
without
education
or
training
they
have
no
power
of
abstract
reasoning
and
intellectual
ideals
they
have
no
touch
with
the
spiritual
world
and
are
without
conception
of
god
or
the
holy
spirit
the
animal
can
neither
recognize
nor
apprehend
the
spiritual
power
of
man
and
makes
no
distinction
between
man
and
itself
for
the
reason
that
its
susceptibilities
are
limited
to
the
plane
of
the
senses
it
lives
under
the
bondage
of
nature
and
natures
laws
all
the
animals
are
materialists
they
are
deniers
of
god
and
without
realization
of
a
transcendent
power
in
the
universe
they
have
no
knowledge
of
the
divine
prophets
and
holy
booksmere
captives
of
nature
and
the
sense
world
in
reality
they
are
like
the
great
philosophers
of
this
day
who
are
not
in
touch
with
god
and
the
holy
spiritdeniers
of
the
prophets
ignorant
of
spiritual
susceptibilities
deprived
of
the
heavenly
bounties
and
without
belief
in
the
supernatural
power
the
animal
lives
this
kind
of
life
blissfully
and
untroubled
whereas
the
material
philosophers
labor
and
study
for
ten
or
twenty
years
in
schools
and
colleges
denying
god
the
holy
spirit
and
divine
inspirations
the
animal
is
even
a
greater
philosopher
for
it
attains
the
ability
to
do
this
without
labor
and
study
for
instance
the
cow
denies
god
and
the
holy
spirit
knows
nothing
of
divine
inspirations
heavenly
bounties
or
spiritual
emotions
and
is
a
stranger
to
the
world
of
hearts
like
the
philosophers
the
cow
is
a
captive
of
nature
and
knows
nothing
beyond
the
range
of
the
senses
the
philosophers
however
glory
in
this
saying
we
are
not
captives
of
superstitions
we
have
implicit
faith
in
the
impressions
of
the
senses
and
know
nothing
beyond
the
realm
of
nature
which
contains
and
covers
everything
but
the
cow
without
study
or
proficiency
in
the
sciences
modestly
and
quietly
views
life
from
the
same
standpoint
living
in
harmony
with
natures
laws
in
the
utmost
dignity
and
nobility
this
is
not
the
glory
of
man
the
glory
of
man
is
in
the
knowledge
of
god
spiritual
susceptibilities
attainment
to
transcendent
powers
and
the
bounties
of
the
holy
spirit
the
glory
of
man
is
in
being
informed
of
the
teachings
of
god
this
is
the
glory
of
humanity
ignorance
is
not
glory
but
darkness
can
these
souls
who
are
steeped
in
the
lower
strata
of
ignorance
become
informed
of
the
mysteries
of
god
and
the
realities
of
existence
while
jesus
christ
was
without
knowledge
of
them
is
the
intellect
of
these
people
greater
than
the
intellect
of
christ
christ
was
heavenly
divine
and
belonged
to
the
world
of
the
kingdom
he
was
the
embodiment
of
spiritual
knowledge
his
intellect
was
superior
to
these
philosophers
his
comprehension
deeper
his
perception
keener
his
knowledge
more
perfect
how
is
it
that
he
overlooked
and
denied
himself
everything
in
this
world
he
attached
little
importance
to
this
material
life
denying
himself
rest
and
composure
accepting
trials
and
voluntarily
suffering
vicissitudes
because
he
was
endowed
with
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
he
beheld
the
splendors
of
the
divine
kingdom
embodied
the
bounties
of
god
and
possessed
ideal
powers
he
was
illumined
with
love
and
mercy
and
so
likewise
were
all
the

this
evening
for
i
am
looking
upon
the
faces
of
those
who
are
earnest
in
their
search
for
reality
and
who
sincerely
long
to
attain
knowledge
of
truth
god
has
created
man
and
endowed
him
with
the
power
of
reason
whereby
he
may
arrive
at
valid
conclusions
therefore
man
must
endeavor
in
all
things
to
investigate
the
fundamental
reality
if
he
does
not
independently
investigate
he
has
failed
to
utilize
the
talent
god
has
bestowed
upon
him
i
am
pleased
with
the
american
people
because
as
a
rule
they
are
independent
seekers
of
the
truth
their
minds
are
actively
employed
instead
of
remaining
idle
and
unproductive
this
is
most
praiseworthy
some
souls
imagine
that
there
is
a
cessation
to
the
bounties
of
god
as
if
at
one
time
the
divine
bestowals
are
poured
out
at
another
time
withheld
from
mankind
and
ceasing
if
we
carefully
reflect
upon
this
matter
we
find
that
such
a
statement
is
in
fact
a
denial
of
divinity
for
the
reality
of
divinity
is
evidenced
by
virtue
of
its
outpourings
or
bestowals
the
cessation
of
the
bestowals
of
god
at
any
time
would
be
equivalent
to
the
cessation
of
the
sovereignty
of
god
the
sun
is
the
sun
because
of
its
ray
and
heat
it
is
the
sun
because
of
its
bestowal
but
if
at
any
time
its
effulgence
splendor
and
radiance
should
cease
to
emanate
it
would
no
longer
be
the
sun
consequently
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
bounties
of
divinity
should
cease
for
the
attributes
of
divinity
are
everexistent
god
has
ever
been
divine
he
hath
ever
exercised
his
sovereignty
and
still
possesses
everlasting
divinity
and
sovereignty
he
is
like
the
sun
which
has
ever
had
its
splendor
heat
and
radiance
and
will
continue
to
possess
these
bounties
and
attributes
if
at
any
time
its
splendor
and
heat
should
cease
it
would
no
longer
be
pronounced
the
sun
therefore
the
sound
reasoning
mind
concludes
that
the
bounties
of
the
holy
spirit
are
continuous
and
that
holy
souls
are
ever
the
recipients
of
these
divine
emanations
the
potency
of
the
holy
spirit
is
everlasting
not
temporary
for
the
sanctity
of
the
holy
spirit
is
its
power
and
efficacy
manifest
in
the
spirits
it
quickens
we
pray
that
all
of
us
may
become
recipients
of
its
bestowals
that
we
may
be
illumined
by
the
lights
of
heaven
edified
through
the
teachings
of
god
and
imbued
with
the
virtues
of
divine
character
as
mirrors
reflecting
the
light
of
the
sun
unless
the
mirror
reflects
the
sunlight
it
is
only
dark
inanimate
matter
likewise
the
hearts
and
spirits
of
mankind
when
deprived
and
without
their
portion
of
the
bounties
of
the
holy
spirit
linger
in
the
abyss
of
darkness
and
ignorance
from
time
immemorial
the
divine
teachings
have
been
successively
revealed
and
the
bounties
of
the
holy
spirit
have
ever
been
emanating
all
the
teachings
are
one
reality
for
reality
is
single
and
does
not
admit
multiplicity
therefore
the
divine
prophets
are
one
inasmuch
as
they
reveal
the
one
reality
the
word
of
god
abraham
announced
teachings
founded
upon
reality
moses
proclaimed
reality
christ
established
reality
and
bahaullah
was
the
messenger
and
herald
of
reality
but
humanity
having
forsaken
the
one
essential
and
fundamental
reality
which
underlies
the
religion
of
god
and
holding
blindly
to
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
and
interpretations
of
belief
is
separated
and
divided
in
the
strife
contention
and
bigotry
of
various
sects
and
religious
factions
if
all
should
be
true
to
the
original
reality
of
the
prophet
and
his
teaching
the
peoples
and
nations
of
the
world
would
become
unified
and
these
differences
which
cause
separation
would
be
lost
sight
of
to
accomplish
this
great
and
needful
unity
in
reality
bahaullah
appeared
in
the
orient
and
renewed
the
foundations
of
the
divine
teachings
his
revelation
of
the
word
embodies
completely
the
teachings
of
all
the
prophets
expressed
in
principles
and
precepts
applicable
to
the
needs
and
conditions
of
the
modern
world
amplified
and
adapted
to
presentday
questions
and
critical
human
problems
that
is
to
say
the
words
of
bahaullah
are
the
essences
of
the
words
of
the
prophets
of
the
past
they
are
the
very
spirit
of
the
age
and
the
cause
of
the
unity
and
illumination
of
the
east
and
the
west
the
followers
of
his
teachings
are
in
conformity
with
the
precepts
and
commands
of
all
the
former
heavenly
messengers
differences
and
dissensions
which
destroy
the
foundations
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
are
contrary
to
the
will
and
good
pleasure
of
god
disappear
completely
in
the
light
of
the
revelation
of
bahaullah
difficult
problems
are
solved
unity
and
love
are
established
for
the
good
pleasure
of
god
is
the
effulgence
of
love
and
the
establishment
of
unity
and
fellowship
in
the
human
world
whereas
discord
contention
warfare
and
strife
are
satanic
outcomes
and
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
merciful
in
order
that
human
souls
minds
and
spirits
may
attain
advancement
tranquillity
and
vision
in
broader
horizons
of
unity
and
knowledge
bahaullah
proclaimed
certain
principles
or
teachings
some
of
which
i
will
mention
first
man
must
independently
investigate
reality
for
the
disagreements
and
dissensions
which
afflict
and
affect
humanity
primarily
proceed
from
imitations
of
ancestral
beliefs
and
adherences
to
hereditary
forms
of
worship
these
imitations
are
accidental
and
without
sanction
in
the
holy
books
they
are
the
outcomes
of
human
interpretations
and
teachings
which
have
arisen
gradually
obscuring
the
real
light
of
divine
meaning
and
causing
men
to
differ
and
dissent
the
reality
proclaimed
in
the
heavenly
books
and
divine
teachings
is
ever
conducive
to
love
unity
and
fellowship
second
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
shall
be
realized
accepted
and
established
when
we
reflect
upon
this
blessed
principle
it
will
become
evident
and
manifest
that
it
is
the
healing
remedy
for
all
human
conditions
all
mankind
are
the
servants
of
the
glorious
god
our
creator
he
has
created
all
assuredly
he
must
have
loved
them
equally
otherwise
he
would
not
have
created
them
he
protects
all
assuredly
he
loves
his
creatures
otherwise
he
would
not
protect
them
he
provides
for
all
proving
his
love
for
all
without
distinction
or
preference
he
manifests
his
perfect
goodness
and
lovingkindness
toward
all
he
does
not
punish
us
for
our
sins
and
shortcomings
and
we
are
all
immersed
in
the
ocean
of
his
infinite
mercy
inasmuch
as
god
is
clement
and
loving
to
his
children
lenient
and
merciful
toward
our
shortcomings
why
should
we
be
unkind
and
unforgiving
toward
each
other
as
he
loves
humanity
without
distinction
or
preference
why
should
we
not
love
all
can
we
conceive
of
a
plan
and
policy
superior
to
the
divine
purpose
manifestly
we
cannot
therefore
we
must
strive
to
do
the
will
of
the
glorious
lord
and
emulate
his
policy
of
loving
all
mankind
the
wisdom
and
policy
of
god
are
reality
and
truth
whereas
human
policy
is
accidental
and
limited
to
our
finite
understanding
the
policy
of
god
is
infinite
we
must
emulate
his
example
if
a
soul
be
ailing
and
infirm
we
must
produce
remedies
if
ignorant
we
must
provide
education
if
defective
we
must
train
and
perfect
that
which
is
lacking
if
immature
and
undeveloped
we
must
supply
the
means
of
attainment
to
maturity
no
soul
should
be
hated
none
neglected
nay
rather
their
very
imperfections
should
demand
greater
kindness
and
tender
compassion
therefore
if
we
follow
the
example
of
the
lord
of
divinity
we
will
love
all
mankind
from
our
hearts
and
the
means
of
the
unity
of
the
world
of
humanity
will
become
as
evident
and
manifest
to
us
as
the
light
of
the
sun
and
from
our
example
the
light
of
the
love
of
god
will
be
enkindled
among
men
for
god
is
love
and
all
phenomena
find
source
and
emanation
in
that
divine
current
of
creation
the
love
of
god
haloes
all
created
things
were
it
not
for
the
love
of
god
no
animate
being
would
exist
this
is
clear
manifest
vision
and
truth
unless
a
man
is
veiled
by
superstitions
and
a
captive
to
imaginations
differentiating
mankind
according
to
his
own
estimate
loving
some
and
hating
others
such
an
attitude
is
most
unworthy
and
ignoble
third
religion
must
be
the
mainspring
and
source
of
love
in
the
world
for
religion
is
the
revelation
of
the
will
of
god
the
divine
fundamental
of
which
is
love
therefore
if
religion
should
prove
to
be
the
cause
of
enmity
and
hatred
instead
of
love
its
absence
is
preferable
to
its
existence
fourth
religion
must
reconcile
and
be
in
harmony
with
science
and
reason
if
the
religious
beliefs
of
mankind
are
contrary
to
science
and
opposed
to
reason
they
are
none
other
than
superstitions
and
without
divine
authority
for
the
lord
god
has
endowed
man
with
the
faculty
of
reason
in
order
that
through
its
exercise
he
may
arrive
at
the
verities
of
existence
reason
is
the
discoverer
of
the
realities
of
things
and
that
which
conflicts
with
its
conclusions
is
the
product
of
human
fancy
and
imagination
fifth
prejudicewhether
it
be
religious
racial
patriotic
or
political
in
its
origin
and
aspectis
the
destroyer
of
human
foundations
and
opposed
to
the
commands
of
god
god
has
sent
forth
his
prophets
for
the
sole
purpose
of
creating
love
and
unity
in
the
world
of
human
hearts
all
the
heavenly
books
are
the
written
word
of
love
if
they
prove
to
be
the
cause
of
prejudice
and
human
estrangement
they
have
become
fruitless
therefore
religious
prejudice
is
especially
opposed
to
the
will
and
command
of
god
racial
and
national
prejudices
which
separate
mankind
into
groups
and
branches
likewise
have
a
false
and
unjustifiable
foundation
for
all
men
are
the
children
of
adam
and
essentially
of
one
family
there
should
be
no
racial
alienation
or
national
division
among
humankind
such
distinctions
as
french
german
persian
anglosaxon
are
human
and
artificial
they
have
neither
significance
nor
recognition
in
the
estimation
of
god
in
his
estimate
all
are
one
the
children
of
one
family
and
god
is
equally
kind
to
them
the
earth
has
one
surface
god
has
not
divided
this
surface
by
boundaries
and
barriers
to
separate
races
and
peoples
man
has
set
up
and
established
these
imaginary
lines
giving
to
each
restricted
area
a
name
and
the
limitation
of
a
native
land
or
nationhood
by
this
division
and
separation
into
groups
and
branches
of
mankind
prejudice
is
engendered
which
becomes
a
fruitful
source
of
war
and
strife
impelled
by
this
prejudice
races
and
nations
declare
war
against
each
other
the
blood
of
the
innocent
is
poured
out
and
the
earth
torn
by
violence
therefore
it
has
been
decreed
by
god
in
this
day
that
these
prejudices
and
differences
shall
be
laid
aside
all
are
commanded
to
seek
the
good
pleasure
of
the
lord
of
unity
to
follow
his
command
and
obey
his
will
in
this
way
the
world
of
humanity
shall
become
illumined
with
the
reality
of
love
and
reconciliation
sixth
the
world
of
humanity
is
in
need
of
the
confirmations
of
the
holy
spirit
true
distinction
among
mankind
is
through
divine
bestowals
and
receiving
the
intuitions
of
the
holy
spirit
if
man
does
not
become
the
recipient
of
the
heavenly
bestowals
and
spiritual
bounties
he
remains
in
the
plane
and
kingdom
of
the
animal
for
the
distinction
between
the
animal
and
man
is
that
man
is
endowed
with
the
potentiality
of
divinity
in
his
nature
whereas
the
animal
is
entirely
bereft
of
that
gift
and
attainment
therefore
if
a
man
is
bereft
of
the
intuitive
breathings
of
the
holy
spirit
deprived
of
divine
bestowals
out
of
touch
with
the
heavenly
world
and
negligent
of
the
eternal
truths
though
in
image
and
likeness
he
is
human
in
reality
he
is
an
animal
even
as
christ
declared
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
this
means
that
if
man
be
a
captive
of
physical
susceptibilities
and
be
lacking
the
quickening
of
spiritual
emotions
he
is
merely
an
animal
but
every
soul
who
possesses
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
has
attained
a
goodly
portion
of
the
bestowals
of
the
holy
spirit
is
alive
with
the
divine
life
of
the
higher
kingdom
the
soul
that
is
portionless
and
bereft
is
as
dead
therefore
he
said
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
just
as
the
physical
body
of
man
is
in
need
of
its
force
of
life
even
so
the
human
soul
is
in
need
of
the
divine
animus
and
vivification
emanating
from
the
holy
spirit
without
this
vivification
and
sustenance
man
would
be
an
animal
nay
rather
dead
seventh
the
necessity
of
education
for
all
mankind
is
evident
children
especially
must
be
trained
and
taught
if
the
parent
cannot
afford
to
do
this
owing
to
lack
of
means
the
body
politic
must
make
necessary
provision
for
its
accomplishment
through
the
broadening
spirit
of
education
illiteracy
will
disappear
and
misunderstandings
due
to
ignorance
will
pass
away
eighth
universal
peace
will
be
established
among
the
nations
of
the
world
by
international
agreement
the
greatest
catastrophe
in
the
world
of
humanity
today
is
war
europe
is
a
storehouse
of
explosives
awaiting
a
spark
all
the
european
nations
are
on
edge
and
a
single
flame
will
set
on
fire
the
whole
of
that
continent
implements
of
war
and
death
are
multiplied
and
increased
to
an
inconceivable
degree
and
the
burden
of
military
maintenance
is
taxing
the
various
countries
beyond
the
point
of
endurance
armies
and
navies
devour
the
substance
and
possessions
of
the
people
the
toiling
poor
the
innocent
and
helpless
are
forced
by
taxation
to
provide
munitions
and
armament
for
governments
bent
upon
conquest
of
territory
and
defense
against
powerful
rival
nations
there
is
no
greater
or
more
woeful
ordeal
in
the
world
of
humanity
today
than
impending
war
therefore
international
peace
is
a
crucial
necessity
an
arbitral
court
of
justice
shall
be
established
by
which
international
disputes
are
to
be
settled
through
this
means
all
possibility
of
discord
and
war
between
the
nations
will
be
obviated
ninth
there
must
be
an
equality
of
rights
between
men
and
women
women
shall
receive
an
equal
privilege
of
education
this
will
enable
them
to
qualify
and
progress
in
all
degrees
of
occupation
and
accomplishment
for
the
world
of
humanity
possesses
two
wings
man
and
woman
if
one
wing
remains
incapable
and
defective
it
will
restrict
the
power
of
the
other
and
full
flight
will
be
impossible
therefore
the
completeness
and
perfection
of
the
human
world
are
dependent
upon
the
equal
development
of
these
two
wings
tenth
there
shall
be
an
equality
of
rights
and
prerogatives
for
all
mankind
eleventh
one
language
must
be
selected
as
an
international
medium
of
speech
and
communication
through
this
means
misunderstandings
will
be
lessened
fellowship
established
and
unity
assured
these
are
a
few
of
the
principles
proclaimed
by
bahaullah
he
has
provided
the
remedy
for
the
ailments
which
now
afflict
the
human
world
solved
the
difficult
problems
of
individual
social
national
and
universal
welfare
and
laid
the
foundation
of
divine
reality
upon
which
material
and
spiritual
civilization
are
to
be
founded
throughout
the
centuries
before
us
praise
be
to
god
i
find
these
two
great
american
nations
highly
capable
and
advanced
in
all
that
appertains
to
progress
and
civilization
these
governments
are
fair
and
equitable
the
motives
and
purposes
of
these
people
are
lofty
and
inspiring
therefore
it
is
my
hope
that
these
revered
nations
may
become
prominent
factors
in
the
establishment
of
international
peace
and
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
that
they
may
lay
the
foundations
of
equality
and
spiritual
brotherhood
among
mankind
that
they
may
manifest
the
highest
virtues
of
the
human
world
revere
the
divine
lights
of
the
prophets
of
god
and
establish
the
reality
of
unity
so
necessary
today
in
the
affairs
of
nations
i
pray
that
the
nations
of
the
east
and
west
shall
become
one
flock
under
the
care
and
guidance
of
the
divine
shepherd
verily
this
is
the
bestowal
of
god
and
the
greatest
honor
of
man
this
is
the
glory
of
humanity
this
is
the
good
pleasure
of
god
i
ask
god
for
this
with
a
contrite
heart
o
my
lord
thou
who
art
everforgiving
verily
this
assembly
hath
turned
its
face
toward
thy

praise
be
to
god
i
have
spent
a
number
of
days
among
you
associating
with
you
in
love
and
fragrance
praise
be
to
god
your
hearts
are
pure
your
faces
radiant
your
spirits
exhilarated
through
the
glad
tidings
of
god
i
pray
in
your
behalf
seeking
heavenly
confirmations
for
you
that
each
one
may
become
a
radiant
candle
shedding
light
in
the
world
of
humanity
may
you
become
the
quintessence
of
love
may
you
prove
to
be
the
effulgence
of
god
replete
with
the
efficacy
of
the
holy
spirit
and
the
cause
of
unity
and
fellowship
in
the
world
of
humanity
for
today
mankind
has
the
greatest
need
of
love
and
agreement
if
the
world
should
remain
as
it
is
today
great
danger
will
face
it
but
if
reconciliation
and
unity
are
witnessed
if
security
and
confidence
be
established
if
with
heart
and
soul
we
strive
in
order
that
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
may
find
effective
penetration
in
the
realities
of
humankind
inducing
fellowship
and
accord
binding
together
the
hearts
of
the
various
religions
and
uniting
divergent
peoples
the
world
of
mankind
shall
attain
peace
and
composure
the
will
of
god
will
become
the
will
of
man
and
the
earth
a
veritable
habitation
of
angels
souls
shall
be
educated
vice
be
dispelled
the
virtues
of
the
world
of
humanity
prevail
materialism
pass
away
religion
be
strengthened
and
prove
to
be
the
bond
which
shall
cement
together
the
hearts
of
men
in
the
world
of
existence
there
are
various
bonds
which
unite
human
hearts
but
not
one
of
these
bonds
is
completely
effective
the
first
and
foremost
is
the
bond
of
family
relationship
which
is
not
an
efficient
unity
for
how
often
it
happens
that
disagreement
and
divergence
rend
asunder
this
close
tie
of
association
the
bond
of
patriotism
may
be
a
means
of
fellowship
and
agreement
but
oneness
of
native
land
will
not
completely
cement
human
hearts
for
if
we
review
history
we
shall
find
that
people
of
the
same
race
and
native
land
have
frequently
waged
war
against
each
other
often
in
civil
strife
they
have
shed
the
same
racial
blood
and
destroyed
the
possessions
of
their
own
native
kind
therefore
this
bond
is
not
sufficient
another
means
of
seeming
unity
is
the
bond
of
political
association
where
governments
and
rulers
have
been
allied
for
reasons
of
intercourse
and
mutual
protection
but
which
agreement
and
union
afterward
became
subject
to
change
and
violent
hatred
even
to
the
extreme
of
war
and
bloodshed
it
is
evident
that
political
oneness
is
not
permanently
effective
the
source
of
perfect
unity
and
love
in
the
world
of
existence
is
the
bond
and
oneness
of
reality
when
the
divine
and
fundamental
reality
enters
human
hearts
and
lives
it
conserves
and
protects
all
states
and
conditions
of
mankind
establishing
that
intrinsic
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
which
can
only
come
into
being
through
the
efficacy
of
the
holy
spirit
for
the
holy
spirit
is
like
unto
the
life
in
the
human
body
which
blends
all
differences
of
parts
and
members
in
unity
and
agreement
consider
how
numerous
are
these
parts
and
members
but
the
oneness
of
the
animating
spirit
of
life
unites
them
all
in
perfect
combination
it
establishes
such
a
unity
in
the
bodily
organism
that
if
any
part
is
subjected
to
injury
or
becomes
diseased
all
the
other
parts
and
functions
sympathetically
respond
and
suffer
owing
to
the
perfect
oneness
existing
just
as
the
human
spirit
of
life
is
the
cause
of
coordination
among
the
various
parts
of
the
human
organism
the
holy
spirit
is
the
controlling
cause
of
the
unity
and
coordination
of
mankind
that
is
to
say
the
bond
or
oneness
of
humanity
cannot
be
effectively
established
save
through
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
for
the
world
of
humanity
is
a
composite
body
and
the
holy
spirit
is
the
animating
principle
of
its
life
therefore
we
must
strive
in
order
that
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
may
become
effective
throughout
the
world
of
mankind
that
it
may
confer
a
new
quickening
life
upon
the
body
politic
of
the
nations
and
peoples
and
that
all
may
be
guided
to
the
protection
and
shelter
of
the
word
of
god
then
this
human
world
will
become
angelic
earthly
darkness
pass
away
and
celestial
illumination
flood
the
horizons
human
defects
be
effaced
and
divine
virtues
become
resplendent
this
is
possible
and
real
but
only
through
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
today
the
greatest
need
of
the
world
is
the
animating
unifying
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
until
it
becomes
effective
penetrating
and
interpenetrating
hearts
and
spirits
and
until
perfect
reasoning
faith
shall
be
implanted
in
the
minds
of
men
it
will
be
impossible
for
the
social
body
to
be
inspired
with
security
and
confidence
nay
on
the
contrary
enmity
and
strife
will
increase
day
by
day
and
the
differences
and
divergences
of
nations
will
be
woefully
augmented
continual
additions
to
the
armies
and
navies
of
the
world
will
be
made
and
the
fear
and
certainty
of
the
great
pandemic
warthe
war
unparalleled
in
historywill
be
intensified
for
armament
heretofore
limited
is
now
being
increased
upon
a
colossal
scale
conditions
are
becoming
acute
drawing
nigh
unto
the
degree
of
men
warring
upon
the
seas
warring
upon
the
plains
warring
in
the
very
atmosphere
with
a
violence
unknown
in
former
centuries
with
the
growth
of
armament
and
preparation
the
dangers
are
increasingly
great
we
must
use
our
utmost
endeavors
in
order
that
the
holy
spirit
may
influence
minds
and
hearts
toward
peace
the
bounties
of
god
surround
the
divine
effulgences
become
successive
human
souls
advance
minds
expand
in
wider
vision
souls
become
more
holy
and
the
world
of
humanity
be
rid
of
its
great
menace
for
the
betterment
of
the
world
bahaullah
endured
all
the
hardships
ordeals
and
vicissitudes
of
life
sacrificing
his
very
being
and
comfort
forfeiting
his
estates
possessions
and
honorall
that
pertains
to
human
existencenot
for
one
year
nay
rather
for
nearly
fifty
years
during
this
long
period
he
was
subjected
to
persecution
and
abuse
was
cast
into
prison
was
banished
from
his
native
land
underwent
severities
and
humiliation
and
was
exiled
four
times
he
was
first
exiled
from
persia
to
baghdad
thence
to
constantinople
thence
to
rumelia
and
finally
to
the
great
prisonfortress
of
akka
in
syria
where
he
passed
the
remainder
of
his
life
every
day
a
new
oppression
and
abuse
was
heaped
upon
him
until
he
winged
his
flight
from
the
dungeon
to
the
supreme
world
and
returned
to
his
lord
he
endured
these
ordeals
and
difficulties
in
order
that
this
earthly
human
world
might
become
heavenly
that
the
illumination
of
the
divine
kingdom
should
become
a
reality
in
human
hearts
that
the
individual
members
of
mankind
might
progress
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
increase
its
efficacy
and
penetration
and
the
happiness
of
the
world
of
humanity
be
assured
he
desired
for
all
tranquillity
and
composure
and
exercised
lovingkindness
toward
the
nations
regardless
of
conditions
and
differences
he
addressed
humanity
saying
o
humankind
verily
ye
are
all
the
leaves
and
fruits
of
one
tree
ye
are
all
one
therefore
associate
in
friendship
love
one
another
abandon
prejudices
of
race
dispel
forever
this
gloomy
darkness
of
human
ignorance
for
the
century
of
light
the
sun
of
reality
hath
appeared
now
is
the
time
for
affiliation
and
now
is
the
period
of
unity
and
concord
for
thousands
of
years
ye
have
been
contending
in
warfare
and
strife
it
is
enough
now
is
the
time
for
unity
lay
aside
all
selfpurposes
and
know
for
a
certainty
that
all
men
are
the
servants
of
one
god
who
will
bind
them
together
in
love
and
agreement
inasmuch
as
great
differences
and
divergences
of
denominational
belief
had
arisen
throughout
the
past
every
man
with
a
new
idea
attributing
it
to
god
bahaullah
desired
that
there
should
not
be
any
ground
or
reason
for
disagreement
among
the
bahais
therefore
with
his
own
pen
he
wrote
the
book
of
his
covenant
addressing
his
relations
and
all
people
of
the
world
saying
verily
i
have
appointed
one
who
is
the
center
of
my
covenant
all
must
obey
him
all
must
turn
to
him
he
is
the
expounder
of
my
book
and
he
is
informed
of
my
purpose
all
must
turn
to
him
whatsoever
he
says
is
correct
for
verily
he
knoweth
the
texts
of
my
book
other
than
he
no
one
doth
know
my
book
the
purpose
of
this
statement
is
that
there
should
never
be
discord
and
divergence
among
the
bahais
but
that
they
should
always
be
unified
and
agreed
in
his
prayers
bahaullah
also
said
o
god
whosoever
violates
my
covenant
o
god
humiliate
him
verily
whosoever
violates
my
covenant
o
god
erase
and
efface
him
in
all
his
tablets
among
which
is
the
tablet
of
the
branch
he
has
mentioned
and
explained
the
attributes
and
qualities
of
the
personage
to
whom
he
referred
in
the
book
of
his
covenant
he
has
fully
expounded
the
function
and
potency
of
that
personage
so
that
no
one
shall
say
i
understand
this
from
the
writings
of
bahaullah
for
he
has
appointed
the
center
or
expounder
of
the
book
he
said
verily
he
is
the
appointed
one
other
than
he
there
is
none
intending
that
no
sects
or
prejudices
should
be
formed
and
preventing
every
man
here
and
there
with
a
new
thought
from
creating
dissension
and
variance
it
is
as
though
a
king
should
appoint
a
governorgeneral
whosoever
obeys
him
obeys
the
king
whosoever
violates
and
disobeys
him
violates
the
king
therefore
whosoever
obeys
the
center
of
the
covenant
appointed
by
bahaullah
has
obeyed
bahaullah
and
whosoever
disobeys
him
has
disobeyed
bahaullah
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
abdulbaha
at
allprecisely
as
the
governorgeneral
appointed
by
the
kingwhosoever
obeys
the
governorgeneral
obeys
the
king
whosoever
disobeys
the
governorgeneral
disobeys
the
king
therefore
you
must
read
the
tablets
of
bahaullah
you
must
read
the
tablet
of
the
branch
and
regard
that
which
he
has
so
clearly
stated
beware
beware
lest
anyone
should
speak
from
the
authority
of
his
own
thoughts
or
create
a
new
thing
out
of
himself
beware
beware
according
to
the
explicit
covenant
of
bahaullah
you
should
care
nothing
at
all
for
such
a
person
bahaullah
shuns
such
souls
i
have
expounded
these
things
for
you
for
the
conservation
and
protection
of
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
in
order
that
you
may
be
informed
lest
any
souls
shall
deceive
you
and
lest
any
souls
shall
cause
suspicion
among
you
you
must
love
all
people
and
yet
if
any
souls
put
you
in
doubt
you
must
know
that
bahaullah
is
severed
from
them
whosoever
works
for
unity
and
fellowship
is
a
servant
of
bahaullah
and
bahaullah
is
his
assistant
and
helper
i
ask
god
that
he
may
cause
you
to
be
the
very
means
of
agreement
and
unity
that
he
may
make
you
radiant
merciful
heavenly
children
of
the
divine
kingdom
that
you
may
advance
day
by
day
that
you
may
become
as
bright
as

notes
by
ellen
t
pursell
praise
be
to
god
this
is
a
beautiful
and
radiant
assemblage
it
is
a
merciful
gathering
for
you
have
met
here
in
the
utmost
love
and
spirituality
there
are
many
meetings
in
the
world
thousands
of
them
perhaps
being
held
at
this
very
moment
mostly
for
social
political
scientific
or
commercial
purposes
but
our
gathering
here
tonight
is
for
god
for
heavenly
purposes
we
are
neither
attached
to
commerce
nor
is
our
interest
scientific
our
spirit
and
motive
are
solely
for
the
manifestation
of
divine
bestowals
man
possesses
two
types
of
virtues
one
is
material
and
the
other
ideal
in
character
for
example
the
body
of
man
expresses
certain
material
virtues
but
the
spirit
of
man
manifests
virtues
that
are
ideal
the
sense
of
sight
in
man
is
a
physical
virtue
but
insight
the
power
of
inner
perception
is
ideal
in
its
nature
the
sense
of
hearing
is
a
physical
endowment
whereas
memory
in
man
is
ideal
among
other
human
forces
the
power
of
ideation
or
faculty
of
intellection
is
material
but
the
power
of
love
is
spiritual
the
acquisition
of
the
realities
of
phenomena
is
an
ideal
virtue
likewise
the
emotions
of
man
and
his
ability
to
prove
the
existence
of
god
realization
of
moral
standards
and
the
world
of
discovery
involve
virtues
essentially
ideal
if
we
review
history
we
will
observe
that
human
advancement
has
been
greatest
in
the
development
of
material
virtues
civilization
is
the
sign
and
evidence
of
this
progression
throughout
the
world
material
civilization
has
attained
truly
wonderful
heights
and
degrees
of
efficiencythat
is
to
say
the
outward
powers
and
virtues
of
man
have
greatly
developed
but
the
inner
and
ideal
virtues
have
been
correspondingly
delayed
and
neglected
it
is
now
the
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
for
us
to
strive
and
give
an
impetus
to
the
advancement
and
development
of
inner
forcesthat
is
to
say
we
must
arise
to
service
in
the
world
of
morality
for
human
morals
are
in
need
of
readjustment
we
must
also
render
service
to
the
world
of
intellectuality
in
order
that
the
minds
of
men
may
increase
in
power
and
become
keener
in
perception
assisting
the
intellect
of
man
to
attain
its
supremacy
so
that
the
ideal
virtues
may
appear
before
a
step
is
taken
in
this
direction
we
must
be
able
to
prove
divinity
from
the
standpoint
of
reason
so
that
no
doubt
or
objection
may
remain
for
the
rationalist
afterward
we
must
be
able
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
bounty
of
godthat
the
divine
bounty
encompasses
humanity
and
that
it
is
transcendental
furthermore
we
must
demonstrate
that
the
spirit
of
man
is
immortal
that
it
is
not
subject
to
disintegration
and
that
it
comprises
the
virtues
of
humanity
material
virtues
have
attained
great
development
but
ideal
virtues
have
been
left
far
behind
if
you
should
ask
a
thousand
persons
what
are
the
proofs
of
the
reality
of
divinity
perhaps
not
one
would
be
able
to
answer
if
you
should
ask
further
what
proofs
have
you
regarding
the
essence
of
god
how
do
you
explain
inspiration
and
revelation
what
are
the
evidences
of
conscious
intelligence
beyond
the
material
universe
can
you
suggest
a
plan
and
method
for
the
betterment
of
human
moralities
can
you
clearly
define
and
differentiate
the
world
of
nature
and
the
world
of
divinityyou
would
receive
very
little
real
knowledge
and
enlightenment
upon
these
questions
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
development
of
the
ideal
virtues
has
been
neglected
people
speak
of
divinity
but
the
ideas
and
beliefs
they
have
of
divinity
are
in
reality
superstition
divinity
is
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
the
manifestation
of
spiritual
virtues
and
ideal
powers
the
intellectual
proofs
of
divinity
are
based
upon
observation
and
evidence
which
constitute
decisive
argument
logically
proving
the
reality
of
divinity
the
effulgence
of
mercy
the
certainty
of
inspiration
and
immortality
of
the
spirit
this
is
in
reality
the
science
of
divinity
divinity
is
not
what
is
set
forth
in
dogmas
and
sermons
of
the
church
ordinarily
when
the
word
divinity
is
mentioned
it
is
associated
in
the
minds
of
the
hearers
with
certain
formulas
and
doctrines
whereas
it
essentially
means
the
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
god
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
truth
the
revelation
of
reality
and
divine
philosophy
philosophy
is
of
two
kinds
natural
and
divine
natural
philosophy
seeks
knowledge
of
physical
verities
and
explains
material
phenomena
whereas
divine
philosophy
deals
with
ideal
verities
and
phenomena
of
the
spirit
the
field
and
scope
of
natural
philosophy
have
been
greatly
enlarged
and
its
accomplishments
are
most
praiseworthy
for
it
has
served
humanity
but
according
to
the
evidence
of
present
world
conditions
divine
philosophywhich
has
for
its
object
the
sublimation
of
human
nature
spiritual
advancement
heavenly
guidance
for
the
development
of
the
human
race
attainment
to
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
knowledge
of
the
verities
of
godhas
been
outdistanced
and
neglected
now
is
the
time
for
us
to
make
an
effort
and
enable
it
to
advance
apace
with
the
philosophy
of
material
investigation
so
that
awakening
of
the
ideal
virtues
may
progress
equally
with
the
unfoldment
of
the
natural
powers
in
the
same
proportion
that
the
body
of
man
is
developing
the
spirit
of
man
must
be
strengthened
and
just
as
his
outer
perceptions
have
been
quickened
his
inner
intellectual
powers
must
be
sensitized
so
that
he
need
not
rely
wholly
upon
tradition
and
human
precedent
in
divine
questions
we
must
not
depend
entirely
upon
the
heritage
of
tradition
and
former
human
experience
nay
rather
we
must
exercise
reason
analyze
and
logically
examine
the
facts
presented
so
that
confidence
will
be
inspired
and
faith
attained
then
and
then
only
the
reality
of
things
will
be
revealed
to
us
the
philosophers
of
greecesuch
as
aristotle
socrates
plato
and
otherswere
devoted
to
the
investigation
of
both
natural
and
spiritual
phenomena
in
their
schools
of
teaching
they
discoursed
upon
the
world
of
nature
as
well
as
the
supernatural
world
today
the
philosophy
and
logic
of
aristotle
are
known
throughout
the
world
because
they
were
interested
in
both
natural
and
divine
philosophy
furthering
the
development
of
the
physical
world
of
mankind
as
well
as
the
intellectual
they
rendered
praiseworthy
service
to
humanity
this
was
the
reason
of
the
triumph
and
survival
of
their
teachings
and
principles
man
should
continue
both
these
lines
of
research
and
investigation
so
that
all
the
human
virtues
outer
and
inner
may
become
possible
the
attainment
of
these
virtues
both
material
and
ideal
is
conditioned
upon
intelligent
investigation
of
reality
by
which
investigation
the
sublimity
of
man
and
his
intellectual
progress
is
accomplished
forms
must
be
set
aside
and
renounced
reality
must
be
sought
we
must
discover
for
ourselves
where
and
what
reality
is
in
religious
beliefs
nations
and
peoples
today
are
imitators
of
ancestors
and
forefathers
if
a
mans
father
was
a
christian
he
himself
is
a
christian
a
buddhist
is
the
son
of
a
buddhist
a
zoroastrian
of
a
zoroastrian
a
gentile
or
an
idolator
follows
the
religious
footsteps
of
his
father
and
ancestry
this
is
absolute
imitation
the
requirement
in
this
day
is
that
man
must
independently
and
impartially
investigate
every
form
of
reality
the
great
question
appertaining
to
humanity
is
religion
the
first
condition
is
that
man
must
intelligently
investigate
its
foundations
the
second
condition
is
that
he
must
admit
and
acknowledge
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
by
this
means
the
attainment
of
true
fellowship
among
mankind
is
assured
and
the
alienation
of
races
and
individuals
is
prevented
all
must
be
considered
the
servants
of
god
all
must
recognize
god
as
the
one
kind
protector
and
creator
in
proportion
to
the
acknowledgment
of
the
oneness
and
solidarity
of
mankind
fellowship
is
possible
misunderstandings
will
be
removed
and
reality
become
apparent
then
will
the
light
of
reality
shine
forth
and
when
reality
illumines
the
world
the
happiness
of
humankind
will
become
a
verity
man
must
spiritually
perceive
that
religion
has
been
intended
by
god
to
be
the
means
of
grace
the
source
of
life
and
cause
of
agreement
if
it
becomes
the
cause
of
discord
enmity
and
hatred
it
is
better
that
man
should
be
without
it
for
in
its
teachings
we
seek
the
spirit
of
charity
and
love
to
bind
the
hearts
of
men
together
if
on
the
contrary
we
find
it
alienates
and
embitters
human
hearts
we
are
justified
in
casting
it
aside
therefore
when
man
through
sincere
investigation
discovers
the
fundamental
reality
of
religion
his
former
prejudices
disappear
and
his
new
condition
of
enlightenment
is
conducive
to
the
development
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
purport
of
our
subject
is
that
just
as
man
is
in
need
of
outward
education
he
is
likewise
in
need
of
ideal
refinement
just
as
the
outer
sense
of
sight
is
necessary
to
him
he
should
also
possess
insight
and
conscious
perception
as
he
needs
hearing
at
the
same
time
memory
is
essential
as
a
body
is
indispensable
to
him
likewise
a
mind
is
requisite
one
is
a
material
virtue
the
other
is
ideal
as
human
creatures
fitted
and
qualified
with
this
dual
endowment
we
must
endeavor
through
the
assistance
and
grace
of
god
and
by
the
exercise
of
our
ideal
power
of
intellect
to
attain
all
lofty
virtues
that
we
may
witness
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
reflect
the
spirit
of
the
kingdom
behold
the
manifest
evidences
of
the
reality
of
divinity
comprehend
irrefutable
proofs
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
live
in
conscious
atonement
with
the
eternal
world
and
become
quickened
and
awake
with
the
life
and
love
of
god

avenue

paul
minnesota
from
stenographic
notes
the
materialists
hold
to
the
opinion
that
the
world
of
nature
is
complete
the
divine
philosophers
declare
that
the
world
of
nature
is
incomplete
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
the
two
the
materialists
call
attention
to
the
perfection
of
nature
the
sun
moon
and
stars
the
trees
in
their
adornment
the
whole
earth
and
the
seaeven
unimportant
phenomena
revealing
the
most
perfect
symmetry
the
divine
philosophers
deny
this
seeming
perfection
and
completeness
in
natures
kingdom
even
though
admitting
the
beauty
of
its
scenes
and
aspects
and
acknowledging
the
irresistible
cosmic
forces
which
control
the
colossal
suns
and
planets
they
hold
that
while
nature
seems
perfect
it
is
nevertheless
imperfect
because
it
has
need
of
intelligence
and
education
in
proof
of
this
they
say
that
man
though
he
be
a
very
god
in
the
realm
of
material
creation
is
himself
in
need
of
an
educator
man
undeveloped
by
education
is
savage
animalistic
brutal
laws
and
regulations
schools
colleges
and
universities
have
for
their
purpose
the
training
of
man
and
his
uplift
from
the
dark
borderland
of
the
animal
kingdom
what
is
the
difference
between
the
people
of
america
and
the
inhabitants
of
central
africa
all
are
human
beings
why
have
the
people
of
america
advanced
to
a
high
degree
of
civilization
while
the
tribes
of
central
africa
remain
in
extreme
ignorance
and
barbarism
the
difference
and
distinction
between
them
is
the
degree
of
education
this
is
unquestioned
the
people
of
europe
and
america
have
been
uplifted
by
education
and
training
from
the
world
of
defects
and
have
ascended
toward
the
realm
of
perfection
whereas
the
people
of
africa
denied
educational
development
remain
in
a
natural
condition
of
illiteracy
and
deprivation
for
nature
is
incomplete
and
defective
education
is
a
necessity
if
a
piece
of
ground
be
left
in
its
natural
and
original
state
it
will
either
become
a
thorny
waste
or
be
covered
by
worthless
weeds
when
cleared
and
cultivated
this
same
unproductive
field
will
yield
plentiful
harvests
of
food
for
human
sustenance
this
same
difference
is
noticeable
among
animals
some
have
been
domesticated
educated
others
left
wild
the
proof
is
clear
that
the
world
of
nature
is
imperfect
the
world
of
education
perfect
that
is
to
say
man
is
rescued
from
the
exigencies
of
nature
by
training
and
culture
consequently
education
is
necessary
obligatory
but
education
is
of
various
kinds
there
is
a
training
and
development
of
the
physical
body
which
ensures
strength
and
growth
there
is
intellectual
education
or
mental
training
for
which
schools
and
colleges
are
founded
the
third
kind
of
education
is
that
of
the
spirit
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
man
is
uplifted
into
the
world
of
moralities
and
illumined
by
the
lights
of
divine
bestowals
the
moral
world
is
only
attained
through
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
and
the
quickening
life
of
the
divine
spirit
for
this
reason
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
appear
in
the
human
world
they
come
to
educate
and
illuminate
mankind
to
bestow
spiritual
susceptibilities
to
quicken
inner
perceptions
and
thereby
adorn
the
reality
of
manthe
human
templewith
divine
graces
through
them
man
may
become
the
point
of
the
emanations
of
god
and
the
recipient
of
heavenly
bounties
under
the
influence
of
their
teachings
he
may
become
the
manifestation
of
the
effulgences
of
god
and
a
magnet
attracting
the
lights
of
the
supreme
world
for
this
reason
the
holy
divine
manifestations
are
the
first
teachers
and
educators
of
humanity
their
traces
are
the
highest
evidences
and
their
spiritual
tuition
is
universal
in
its
application
to
the
world
of
mankind
their
influence
and
power
are
immeasurable
and
unlimited
one
heavenly
personage
has
developed
many
nations
for
example
jesus
christ
single
and
unassisted
educated
the
roman
greek
and
assyrian
nations
and
all
of
europe
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
greatest
education
is
that
of
the
spirit
the
spirit
of
man
must
acquire
its
bounties
from
the
kingdom
of
god
in
order
that
it
may
become
the
mirror
and
manifestation
of
lights
and
the
dawning
point
of
divine
traces
because
the
human
reality
is
like
the
soil
if
no
bounty
of
rain
descends
from
heaven
upon
the
soil
if
no
heat
of
the
sun
penetrates
it
will
remain
black
forbidding
unproductive
but
when
the
moistening
shower
and
the
effulgent
glow
of
the
suns
rays
fall
upon
it
beautiful
and
redolent
flowers
grow
from
its
bosom
similarly
the
human
spirit
or
reality
of
man
unless
it
becomes
the
recipient
of
the
lights
of
the
kingdom
develops
divine
susceptibilities
and
consciously
reflects
the
effulgence
of
god
will
not
be
the
manifestation
of
ideal
bounties
for
only
the
reality
of
man
can
become
the
mirror
wherein
the
lights
of
god
are
revealed
the
reality
of
man
will
then
be
as
the
spirit
of
this
world
for
just
as
the
animus
of
life
quickens
the
physical
human
body
so
the
body
of
the
world
will
receive
its
vivification
through
the
animating
virtue
of
the
sanctified
spirit
of
man
it
is
evident
that
the
holy
manifestations
and
divine
dawning
points
are
necessary
for
these
blessed
and
glorious
souls
are
the
foremost
teachers
and
educators
of
mankind
and
all
human
souls
are
developed
through
them
by
the
bounty
of
the
holy
spirit
of
god
during
the
ministry
of
jesus
christ
in
palestine
he
was
surrounded
by
people
of
various
nations
including
the
jews
all
of
them
living
in
the
condition
of
extreme
ignorance
bereft
of
the
word
of
god
and
darkened
in
consciousness
christ
educated
these
people
and
quickened
them
with
the
life
of
the
word
so
that
they
in
turn
became
the
instruments
of
educating
the
world
illumining
the
east
and
the
west
consider
the
wonderful
effect
of
spiritual
education
and
training
by
it
the
fisherman
peter
was
transformed
into
the
greatest
of
teachers
spiritual
education
made
the
disciples
radiant
lamps
in
the
darkness
of
the
world
and
caused
the
christians
of
the
first
and
second
centuries
to
become
renowned
everywhere
for
their
virtues
even
philosophers
bore
testimony
to
this
among
them
was
galen
the
physician
who
wrote
a
book
upon
the
subject
of
the
progress
of
the
nations
he
was
a
celebrated
philosopher
of
the
greeks
although
not
a
christian
in
his
book
he
stated
that
religious
beliefs
exercise
a
tremendous
influence
upon
civilization
and
that
the
world
is
in
need
of
such
belief
in
proof
of
this
he
said
in
substance
in
our
time
there
is
a
certain
people
called
christians
who
though
neither
philosophers
nor
scholastically
trained
are
superior
to
all
others
as
regards
their
morality
they
are
perfect
in
morals
each
one
of
them
is
like
a
great
philosopher
in
morals
ethics
and
turning
toward
the
kingdom
of
god
this
is
evidence
from
the
testimony
of
an
intelligent
outside
observer
that
spiritual
education
is
the
light
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
that
its
absence
in
the
world
is
darkness
itself
bahaullah
appeared
in
persia
at
a
time
when
the
darkness
of
ignorance
enveloped
the
east
and
there
was
no
trace
of
human
love
and
fellowship
through
divine
education
and
the
power
of
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
he
so
refined
the
souls
of
the
persians
who
followed
him
that
they
attained
a
station
of
highest
intelligence
and
reflected
the
attributes
of
perfection
to
the
world
whereas
formerly
they
were
ignorant
they
became
knowing
they
were
weak
they
became
mighty
they
were
without
integrity
they
became
conscientious
they
were
hostile
toward
all
men
they
developed
love
for
humanity
they
were
spiritually
negligent
they
became
mindful
and
attentive
they
were
sleeping
they
became
awakened
they
disagreed
among
themselves
they
united
in
love
and
are
now
striving
to
render
service
to
the
world
of
humankind
service
to
god
and
mankind
is
their
sole
intention
they
have
neither
wish
nor
desire
save
that
which
is
in
accordance
with
the
good
pleasure
of
god
the
good
pleasure
of
god
is
love
for
his
creatures
the
will
and
plan
of
god
is
that
each
individual
member
of
humankind
shall
become
illumined
like
unto
a
lamp
radiant
with
all
the
destined
virtues
of
humanity
leading
his
fellow
creatures
out
of
natural
darkness
into
the
heavenly
light
therein
rests
the
virtue
and
glory
of
the
world
of
humanity
this
is
the
perfection
honor
and
glory
of
man
otherwise
man
is
an
animal
and
without
differentiation
from
the
creatures
of
that
lower
kingdom
it
is
clearly
evident
that
while
man
possesses
powers
in
common
with
the
animal
he
is
distinguished
from
the
animal
by
intellectual
attainment
spiritual
perception
the
acquisition
of
virtues
capacity
to
receive
the
bestowals
of
divinity
lordly
bounty
and
emanations
of
heavenly
mercy
this
is
the
adornment
of
man
his
honor
and
sublimity
humanity
must
strive
toward
this
supreme
station
christ
has
interpreted
this
station
as
the
second
birth
man
is
first
born
from
a
world
of
darkness
the
matrix
of
the
mother
into
this
physical
world
of
light
in
the
dark
world
from
whence
he
came
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
virtues
of
this
existence
he
has
been
liberated
from
a
condition
of
darkness
and
brought
into
a
new
and
spacious
realm
where
there
is
sunlight
the
stars
are
shining
the
moon
sheds
its
radiance
there
are
beautiful
views
gardens
of
roses
fruits
and
all
the
blessings
of
the
present
world
how
did
he
attain
these
blessings
through
the
agency
of
birth
from
the
mother
just
as
man
has
been
physically
born
into
this
world
he
may
be
reborn
from
the
realm
and
matrix
of
nature
for
the
realm
of
nature
is
a
condition
of
animalism
darkness
and
defect
in
this
second
birth
he
attains
the
world
of
the
kingdom
there
he
witnesses
and
realizes
that
the
world
of
nature
is
a
world
of
gloom
whereas
the
kingdom
is
a
world
of
radiance
the
world
of
nature
is
a
world
of
defects
the
kingdom
is
a
realm
of
perfection
the
world
of
nature
is
a
world
without
enlightenment
the
kingdom
of
spiritual
humanity
is
a
heaven
of
illumination
great
discoveries
and
revelations
are
now
possible
for
him
he
has
attained
the
reality
of
perception
his
circle
of
understanding
is
illimitably
widened
he
views
the
realities
of
creation

from
stenographic
notes
i
have
come
from
distant
lands
of
the
east
to
visit
you
crossing
the
great
ocean
and
traveling
a
long
distance
upon
this
continent
consider
how
i
have
longed
to
meet
you
for
my
body
is
frail
and
weak
incapable
of
long
endurance
yetpraise

to
godwe
have
at
last
reached
denver
such
a
gathering
as
this
is
worthy
of
thanksgiving
it
is
peerless
and
unique
among
meetings
other
meetings
are
held
from
motives
of
material
interestssuch
as
social
political
commercial
educationalbut
this
assemblage
has
no
other
purpose
than

turned
to
god
spirits
are
exalted
through
the
glad

the
intentions

all
are
directed
to
god
what
better
meeting
could
be
imagined
than
this
such
a
gathering
is
fundamentally
spiritual
sincere
and
most
important
but
we
must
arise
in
the
accomplishment
of
its
purposes
for
our
attention
is
directed
toward
the
heavenly
kingdom
unto
which
we
must
render
faithful
service
therefore
all
individuals
present
here
must
be
in
the
attitude
of
perfect
love
and
fellowship
manifesting
the
utmost
humility
and
selfsacrifice
turning
our
thoughts
toward
the
kingdom
of
god
so
that
our
meeting
may
be
an
expression
of
the
glorified
hosts
of
the
supreme
concourse
praise
be

are
living
in
a
century
of
light

are
upon
earth
in
the
day
of
divine
effulgence
praise
be
to
god
we
are
alive
in
this
time
of
the
manifestation
of
divine
love
praise
be
to
god
that
we
live
in
the
day
of
the
outpouring
of
heavenly
bounty
praise
be
to
god
this
is
a
day
wherein
the
lights
and
splendors
have
awakened
progress
throughout
the
east
and
the
west
many
holy
souls
in
former
times
longed
to
witness
this
century
lamenting
night
and
day
yearning
to
be
upon
the
earth
in
this
cycle
but
our
presence
and
privilege
is
the
beneficent
gift
of
the
lord
in
his
divine
mercy
and
absolute
virtue
he
has
bestowed
this
upon
us
even
as
christ
declared
many
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
verily
god
has
chosen
you
for
his
love
and
knowledge
god
has
chosen
you
for
the
worthy
service
of
unifying
mankind
god
has
chosen
you
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
reality
and
promulgating
international
peace
god
has
chosen
you
for
the
progress
and
development
of
humanity
for
spreading
and
proclaiming
true
education
for
the
expression
of
love
toward
your
fellow
creatures
and
the
removal
of
prejudice
god
has
chosen
you
to
blend
together
human
hearts
and
give
light
to
the
human
world
the
doors
of
his
generosity
are
wide
wide
open
to
us
but
we
must
be
attentive
alert
and
mindful
occupied
with
service
to
all
mankind
appreciating
the
bestowals
of
god
and
ever
conforming
to
his
will
observe
how
darkness
has
overspread
the
world
in
every
corner
of
the
earth
there
is
strife
discord
and
warfare
of
some
kind
mankind
is
submerged
in
the
sea
of
materialism
and
occupied
with
the
affairs
of
this
world
they
have
no
thought
beyond
earthly
possessions
and
manifest
no
desire
save
the
passions
of
this
fleeting
mortal
existence
their
utmost
purpose
is
the
attainment
of
material
livelihood
physical
comforts
and
worldly
enjoyments
such
as
constitute
the
happiness
of
the
animal
world
rather
than
the
world
of
man
the
honor
of
man
is
through
the
attainment
of
the
knowledge
of
god
his
happiness
is
from
the
love
of
god
his
joy
is
in
the
glad
tidings
of
god
his
greatness
is
dependent
upon
his
servitude
to
god
the
highest
development
of
man
is
his
entrance
into
the
divine
kingdom
and
the
outcome
of
this
human
existence
is
the
nucleus
and
essence
of
eternal
life
if
man
is
bereft
of
the
divine
bestowals
and
if
his
enjoyment
and
happiness
are
restricted
to
his
material
inclinations
what
distinction
or
difference
is
there
between
the
animal
and
himself
in
fact
the
animals
happiness
is
greater
for
its
wants
are
fewer
and
its
means
of
livelihood
easier
to
acquire
although
it
is
necessary
for
man
to
strive
for
material
needs
and
comforts
his
real
need
is
the
acquisition
of
the
bounties
of
god
if
he
is
bereft
of
divine
bounties
spiritual
susceptibilities
and
heavenly
glad
tidings
the
life
of
man
in
this
world
has
not
yielded
any
worthy
fruit
while
possessing
physical
life
he
should
lay
hold
of
the
life
spiritual
and
together
with
bodily
comforts
and
happiness
he
should
enjoy
divine
pleasures
and
content
then
is
man
worthy
of
the
title
man
then
will
he
be
after
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
for
the
image
of
the
merciful
consists
of
the
attributes
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
if
no
fruits
of
the
kingdom
appear
in
the
garden
of
his
soul
man
is
not
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
but
if
those
fruits
are
forthcoming
he
becomes
the
recipient
of
ideal
bestowals
and
is
enkindled
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
if
his
morals
become
spiritual
in
character
his
aspirations
heavenly
and
his
actions
conformable
to
the
will
of
god
man
has
attained
the
image
and
likeness
of
his
creator
otherwise
he
is
the
image
and
likeness
of
satan
therefore
christ
hath
said
ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits
what
are
the
fruits
of
the
human
world
they
are
the
spiritual
attributes
which
appear
in
man
if
man
is
bereft
of
those
attributes
he
is
like
a
fruitless
tree
one
whose
aspiration
is
lofty
and
who
has
developed
selfreliance
will
not
be
content
with
a
mere
animal
existence
he
will
seek
the
divine
kingdom
he
will
long
to
be
in
heaven
although
he
still
walks
the
earth
in
his
material
body
and
though
his
outer
visage
be
physical
his
face
of
inner
reflection
will
become
spiritual
and
heavenly
until
this
station
is
attained
by
man
his
life
will
be
utterly
devoid
of
real
outcomes
the
span
of
his
existence
will
pass
away
in
eating
drinking
and
sleeping
without
eternal
fruits
heavenly
traces
or
illuminationwithout
spiritual
potency
everlasting
life
or
the
lofty
attainments
intended
for
him
during
his
pilgrimage
through
the
human
world
you
must
thank
god
that
your
efforts
are
high
and
noble
that
your
endeavors
are
worthy
that
your
intentions
are
centered
upon
the
kingdom
of
god
and
that
your
supreme
desire
is
the
acquisition
of
eternal
virtues
you
must
act
in
accordance
with
these
requirements
a
man
may
be
a
bahai
in
name
only
if
he
is
a
bahai
in
reality
his
deeds
and
actions
will
be
decisive
proofs
of
it
what
are
the
requirements
love
for
mankind
sincerity
toward
all
reflecting
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
philanthropy
becoming
enkindled
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
attainment
to
the
knowledge
of
god
and
that
which
is
conducive
to
human
welfare
this
evening
we
were
speaking
of
the
fellowship
and
unity
of
the
persian
bahais
they
can
truly
be
called
lovers
for
example
if
one
of
the
friends
of
god
arrived
in
their
city
all
the
friends
would
rejoice
and
assemble
together
in
a
meeting
with
him
if
he
were
ill
they
would
care
for
him
if
sad
they
would
comfort
him
they
would
care
for
him
in
every
way
and
give
unmistakable
evidence
that
there
is
a
spiritual
relationship
amongst
them
strangers
and
outsiders
are
astonished
at
this
love
and
radiant
affection
existing
among
the
bahais
they
inquire
about
it
they
observe
the
unity
and
agreement
manifest
among
them
they
say
what
a
beautiful
spirit
shines
in
their
faces
all
envy
it
and
wish
that
such
a
bond
of
love
might
be
witnessed
everywhere
therefore
to
you
my
first
admonition
is
this
associate
most
kindly
with
all
be
as
one
family
pursue
this
same
pathway
let
your
intentions
be
one
that
your
love
may
permeate
and
affect
the
hearts
of
others
so
that
they
may
grow
to
love
each
other
and
all
attain
to
this
condition
of
oneness
the
world
of
humanity
is
filled
with
darkness
you
are
its
radiant
candles
it
is
very
poor
you
must
be
the
treasury
of
the
kingdom
it
is
exceedingly
debased
you
must
be
the
cause
of
its
exaltation
it
is
bereft
of
divine
graces
you
must
give
it
impetus
and
spiritual
quickening
according
to
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
you
must
love
and
cherish
each
individual
member
of
humanity
the
first
sign
of
faith
is
love
the
message
of
the
holy
divine
manifestations
is
love
the
phenomena
of
creation
are
based
upon
love
the
radiance
of
the
world
is
due
to
love
the
wellbeing
and
happiness
of
the
world
depend
upon
it
therefore
i
admonish
you
that
you
must
strive
throughout
the
human
world
to
diffuse
the
light
of
love
the
people
of
this
world
are
thinking
of
warfare
you
must
be
peacemakers
the
nations
are
selfcentered
you
must
be
thoughtful
of
others
rather
than
yourselves
they
are
neglectful
you
must
be
mindful
they
are
asleep
you
should
be
awake
and
alert
may
each
one
of
you
be
as
a
shining
star
in
the
horizon
of
eternal
glory
this
is
my
wish
for
you
and
my
highest
hope
i
have
come
long
distances
that
you
may
attain
these
attributes
and
divine
favors
praise
be
to
god
i
have
attended
this
meeting
which
has
for
its
purpose
the
commemoration
of
god
september
talk
at
second
divine
science
church
west
thirtyeighth
avenue
denver
colorado
from
stenographic
notes
in
the
orient
i
was
informed
of
the
lofty
purposes
and
wonderful
attainments
of
the
american
people
when
i
arrived
in
this
country
i
realized
that
american
ideals
are
indeed
most
praiseworthy
and
that
the
people
here
are
lovers
of
truth
they
investigate
reality
and
there
is
no
trace
of
fanaticism
among
them
today
the
nations
of
the
world
are
on
the
verge
of
war
influenced
and
impelled
by
prejudices
of
ignorance
and
racial
fanaticism
praise
be
to
god
you
are
free
from
such
prejudice
for
you
believe
in
the
oneness
and
solidarity
of
the
world
of
humanity
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
divine
confirmations
will
uphold
you
one
of
the
forms
of
prejudice
which
afflict
the
world
of
mankind
is
religious
bigotry
and
fanaticism
when
this
hatred
burns
in
human
hearts
it
becomes
the
cause
of
revolution
destruction
abasement
of
humankind
and
deprivation
of
the
mercy
of
god
for
the
holy
manifestations
and
divine
founders
of
religion
themselves
were
completely
unified
in
love
and
agreement
whereas
their
followers
are
characterized
by
bitter
antagonism
and
attitudes
of
hostility
toward
each
other
god
has
desired
for
mankind
the
effulgence
of
love
but
through
blindness
and
misapprehension
man
has
enveloped
himself
in
veils
of
discord
strife
and
hatred
the
supreme
need
of
humanity
is
cooperation
and
reciprocity
the
stronger
the
ties
of
fellowship
and
solidarity
amongst
men
the
greater
will
be
the
power
of
constructiveness
and
accomplishment
in
all
the
planes
of
human
activity
without
cooperation
and
reciprocal
attitude
the
individual
member
of
human
society
remains
selfcentered
uninspired
by
altruistic
purposes
limited
and
solitary
in
development
like
the
animal
and
plant
organisms
of
the
lower
kingdoms
the
lower
creatures
are
not
in
need
of
cooperation
and
reciprocity
a
tree
can
live
solitary
and
alone
but
this
is
impossible
for
man
without
retrogression
therefore
every
cooperative
attitude
and
activity
of
human
life
is
praiseworthy
and
foreintended
by
the
will
of
god
the
first
expression
of
cooperation
is
family
relationship
which
is
unreliable
and
uncertain
in
its
potency
for
it
is
subject
to
separation
and
does
not
permanently
cement
together
the
individual
members
of
humanity
there
is
also
a
cooperation
and
oneness
in
nativity
or
race
which
is
likewise
not
efficient
for
although
its
members
may
agree
in
general
they
differ
radically
in
personal
and
particular
points
of
view
racial
association
therefore
will
not
ensure
the
requirements
of
divine
relationship
there
are
other
means
in
the
human
world
by
which
physical
association
is
established
but
these
fail
to
weld
together
the
hearts
and
spirits
of
men
and
are
correspondingly
inefficient
therefore
it
is
evident
that
god
has
destined
and
intended
religion
to
be
the
cause
and
means
of
cooperative
effort
and
accomplishment
among
mankind
to
this
end
he
has
sent
the
prophets
of
god
the
holy
manifestations
of
the
word
in
order
that
the
fundamental
reality
and
religion
of
god
may
prove
to
be
the
bond
of
human
unity
for
the
divine
religions
revealed
by
these
holy
messengers
have
one
and
the
same
foundation
all
will
admit
therefore
that
the
divine
religions
are
intended
to
be
the
means
of
true
human
cooperation
that
they
are
united
in
the
purpose
of
making
humanity
one
family
for
they
rest
upon
the
universal
foundation
of
love
and
love
is
the
first
effulgence
of
divinity
each
one
of
the
divine
religions
has
established
two
kinds
of
ordinances
the
essential
and
the
accidental
the
essential
ordinances
rest
upon
the
firm
unchanging
eternal
foundations
of
the
word
itself
they
concern
spiritualities
seek
to
stabilize
morals
awaken
intuitive
susceptibilities
reveal
the
knowledge
of
god
and
inculcate
the
love
of
all
mankind
the
accidental
laws
concern
the
administration
of
outer
human
actions
and
relations
establishing
rules
and
regulations
requisite
for
the
world
of
bodies
and
their
control
these
are
ever
subject
to
change
and
supersedure
according
to
exigencies
of
time
place
and
condition
for
example
during
the
time
of
moses
ten
commandments
concerning
the
punishment
of
murder
were
revealed
in
his
book
divorce
was
sanctioned
and
polygamy
allowable
to
a
certain
extent
if
a
man
committed
theft
his
hand
was
cut
off
this
was
drastic
law
and
severe
punishment
applicable
to
the
time
of
moses
but
when
the
time
of
christ
came
minds
had
developed
realizations
were
keener
and
spiritual
perceptions
had
advanced
so
that
certain
laws
concerning
murder
plurality
of
wives
and
divorce
were
abrogated
but
the
essential
ordinances
of
the
mosaic
dispensation
remained
unchanged
these
were
the
fundamental
realities
of
the
knowledge
of
god
and
the
holy
manifestations
the
purification
of
morals
the
awakening
of
spiritual
susceptibilitieseternal
principles
in
which
there
is
no
change
or
transformation
briefly
the
foundation
of
the
divine
religions
is
one
eternal
foundation
but
the
laws
for
temporary
conditions
and
exigencies
are
subject
to
change
therefore
by
adherence
to
these
temporary
laws
blindly
following
and
imitating
ancestral
forms
difference
and
divergence
have
arisen
among
followers
of
the
various
religions
resulting
in
disunion
strife
and
hatred
blind
imitations
and
dogmatic
observances
are
conducive
to
alienation
and
disagreement
they
lead
to
bloodshed
and
destruction
of
the
foundations
of
humanity
therefore
the
religionists
of
the
world
must
lay
aside
these
imitations
and
investigate
the
essential
foundation
or
reality
itself
which
is
not
subject
to
change
or
transformation
this
is
the
divine
means
of
agreement
and
unification
the
purpose
of
all
the
divine
religions
is
the
establishment
of
the
bonds
of
love
and
fellowship
among
men
and
the
heavenly
phenomena
of
the
revealed
word
of
god
are
intended
to
be
a
source
of
knowledge
and
illumination
to
humanity
so
long
as
man
persists
in
his
adherence
to
ancestral
forms
and
imitation
of
obsolete
ceremonials
denying
higher
revelations
of
the
divine
light
in
the
world
strife
and
contention
will
destroy
the
purpose
of
religion
and
make
love
and
fellowship
impossible
each
of
the
holy
manifestations
announced
the
glad
tidings
of
his
successor
and
each
one
confirmed
the
message
of
his
predecessor
therefore
inasmuch
as
they
were
agreed
and
united
in
purpose
and
teaching
it
is
incumbent
upon
their
followers
to
be
likewise
unified
in
love
and
spiritual
fellowship
in
no
other
way
will
discord
and
alienation
disappear
and
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
be
established
after
we
have
proved
the
validity
of
the
manifestations
of
the
word
of
god
by
investigating
the
divine
teachings
we
must
discover
for
a
certainty
whether
they
have
been
real
educators
of
mankind
among
the
revelators
of
the
law
of
god
was
moses
when
he
appeared
all
the
contemporaneous
nations
rejected
him
notwithstanding
this
single
and
alone
he
promulgated
the
divine
teachings
and
liberated
a
nation
from
the
lowest
condition
of
degradation
and
bondage
the
people
of
israel
were
ignorant
lowly
debased
in
moralsa
race
of
slaves
under
burdensome
oppression
moses
led
them
out
of
captivity
and
brought
them
to
the
holy
land
he
educated
and
disciplined
them
established
among
them
the
foundations
of
material
and
divine
civilization
through
the
education
of
moses
these
ignorant
people
attained
an
advanced
degree
of
power
and
prestige
culminating
in
the
glory
of
the
reign
of
solomon
from
the
abyss
of
bereavement
and
slavery
they
were
uplifted
to
the
highest
plane
of
progress
and
civilized
nationhood
it
is
evident
therefore
that
moses
was
an
educator
and
teacher
the
purpose
and
mission
of
the
holy
divine
messengers
is
the
training
and
advancement
of
humanity
the
cultivation
of
divine
fruits
in
the
gardens
of
human
hearts
the
reflection
of
heavenly
effulgence
in
the
mirrors
of
human
souls
the
quickening
of
mental
capacity
and
the
increase
of
spiritual
susceptibilities
when
these
results
and
outcomes
are
witnessed
in
mankind
the
function
and
mission
of
the
manifestations
are
unmistakable
christ
single
and
alone
without
schooling
or
outward
education
and
trained
to
labor
in
the
shop
of
a
carpenter
appeared
in
the
world
at
the
time
when
the
jewish
nation
was
in
the
greatest
abasement
this
radiant
youth
without
wealth
power
of
armies
or
prestige
rescued
the
jews
who
believed
on
him
from
tyranny
and
degradation
and
lifted
them
to
the
highest
plane
of
development
and
glory
peter
his
disciple
was
a
fisherman
through
the
power
of
christ
he
shed
light
upon
all
the
horizons
of
the
world
furthermore
various
people
of
the
greek
roman
egyptian
and
assyrian
nations
were
brought
together
in
unity
and
agreement
where
warfare
and
bloodshed
had
existed
humility
and
love
were
manifest
and
the
foundations
of
divine
religion
were
established
never
to
be
destroyed
this
proves
that
christ
was
a
heavenly
teacher
and
educator
of
the
world
of
humanity
for
such
evidences
are
historical
and
irrefutable
not
based
upon
tradition
and
circumstantial
report
the
power
of
his
word
in
cementing
these
nations
together
is
as
clear
and
evident
as
the
sun
at
midday
there
is
no
need
of
further
demonstration
the
proof
of
the
validity
of
a
manifestation
of
god
is
the
penetration
and
potency
of
his
word
the
cultivation
of
heavenly
attributes
in
the
hearts
and
lives
of
his
followers
and
the
bestowal
of
divine
education
upon
the
world
of
humanity
this
is
absolute
proof
the
world
is
a
school
in
which
there
must
be
teachers
of
the
word
of
god
the
evidence
of
the
ability
of
these
teachers
is
efficient
education
of
the
graduating
classes
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
horizon
of
persia
was
shrouded
in
great
darkness
and
ignorance
the
people
of
that
country
were
in
a
condition
of
barbarism
hatred
and
bigotry
prevailed
among
the
various
religions
bloodshed
and
hostility
were
frequent
among
sects
and
denominations
of
belief
there
were
no
evidences
of
affiliation
and
unity
violent
prejudice
and
antagonism
ruled
the
hearts
of
men
at
such
a
time
as
this
bahaullah
proclaimed
the
first
principle
of
his
mission
and
teachingthe
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
his
second
announcement
was
the
investigation
of
reality
the
third
was
the
oneness
of
the
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
through
spiritual
education
he
led
the
people
out
of
darkness
and
ignorance
into
the
clear
light
of
truth
illuminated
their
hearts
with
the
splendor
of
knowledge
laid
a
true
and
universal
basis
for
religious
teachings
cultivated
the
virtues
of
humanity
conferred
spiritual
susceptibilities
awakened
inner
perceptions
and
changed
the
dishonor
of
prejudiced
souls
to
the
highest
degree
of
honor
and
capacity
today
in
persia
and
the
orient
you
will
find
the
followers
of
bahaullah
united
in
the
closest
ties
of
fellowship
and
love
they
have
abandoned
religious
prejudices
and
have
become
as
one
family
when
you
enter
their
meetings
you
will
find
christians
muslims
buddhists
zoroastrians
jews
and
representatives
of
other
beliefs
present
all
conjoined
in
a
wonderful
unity
without
a
trace
of
bigotry
or
fanaticism
and
the
light
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
reflected
in
their
faces
day
by
day
they
are
advancing
manifesting
greater
and
still
greater
love
for
each
other
their
faith
is
fixed
upon
the
unification
of
mankind
and
their
highest
purpose
is
the
oneness
of
religious
belief
they
proclaim
to
all
humanity
the
sheltering
mercy
and
infinite
grace
of
god
they
teach
the
reconciliation
of
religion
with
science
and
reason
they
show
forth
in
words
and
deeds
the
reality
of
love
for
all
mankind
as
the
servants
of
one
god
and
the
recipients
of
his
universal
bounty
these
are
their
thoughts
their
beliefs
their
guiding
principles
their
religion
no
trace
of
religious
racial
patriotic
or
political
prejudice
can
be
found
among
them
for
they
are
real
servants
of
god
and
obedient
to
his
will
and
command
my
highest
hope
and
desire
is
that
the
strongest
and
most
indissoluble
bond
shall
be
established
between
the
american
nation
and
the
people
of
the
orient
this
is
my
prayer
to
god
may
the
day
come
when
through
divine
and
spiritual
activity
in
the
human
world
the
religions
shall
be
reconciled
and
all
races
of
mankind
come
together
in
unity
and
love
fifty
years
ago
bahaullah
proclaimed
the
peace
of
the
nations
and
oneness
of
the
divine
religions
addressing
his
words
to
all
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
world
in
specific
tablets
therefore
my
supreme
desire
is
the
unity
of
the
east
and
west
universal
peace
and
the
oneness
of

notes
by

straun
it
is
a
great
happiness
to
be
here
this
evening
especially
for
the
reason
that
the
members
of
this
association
have
come
from
the
region
of
the
orient
for
a
long
time
i
have
entertained
a
desire
to
meet
some
of
the
japanese
friends
that
nation
has
achieved
extraordinary
progress
in
a
short
space
of
timea
progress
and
development
which
have
astonished
the
world
inasmuch
as
they
have
advanced
in
material
civilization
they
must
assuredly
possess
the
capacity
for
spiritual
development
for
this
reason
i
have
an
excessive
longing
to
meet
them
praise
be
to
god
this
pleasure
is
now
afforded
me
for
here
in
this
city
i
am
face
to
face
with
a
revered
group
of
the
japanese
according
to
report
the
people
of
the
japanese
nation
are
not
prejudiced
they
investigate
reality
wherever
they
find
truth
they
prove
to
be
its
lovers
they
are
not
attached
tenaciously
to
blind
imitations
of
ancient
beliefs
and
dogmas
therefore
it
is
my
great
desire
to
discourse
with
them
upon
a
subject
in
order
that
the
unity
and
blending
together
of
the
nations
of
the
east
and
the
nations
of
the
west
may
be
furthered
and
accomplished
in
this
way
religious
racial
and
political
prejudice
partisan
bias
and
sectarianism
will
be
dispelled
amongst
men
any
kind
of
prejudice
is
destructive
to
the
body
politic
when
we
review
history
from
the
beginning
of
human
existence
to
the
present
age
in
which
we
live
it
is
evident
all
war
and
conflict
bloodshed
and
battle
every
form
of
sedition
has
been
due
to
some
form
of
prejudicewhether
religious
racial
or
nationalto
partisan
bias
and
selfish
prejudice
of
some
sort
even
today
we
witness
an
upheaval
in
the
balkans
a
war
of
religious
prejudice
some
years
ago
when
i
was
living
in
rumelia
war
broke
out
among
the
religious
peoples
there
was
no
attitude
of
justice
or
equity
whatever
amongst
them
they
pillaged
the
properties
of
each
other
burning
each
others
homes
and
houses
slaughtering
men
women
and
children
imagining
that
such
warfare
and
bloodshed
was
the
means
of
drawing
near
to
god
this
clearly
proved
that
prejudice
is
a
destroyer
of
the
foundations
of
the
world
of
humanity
whereas
religion
was
meant
to
be
the
cause
of
fellowship
and
agreement
religion
must
be
the
cause
of
love
religion
must
be
the
cause
of
justice
for
the
wisdom
of
the
manifestations
of
god
is
directed
toward
the
establishing
of
the
bond
of
a
love
which
is
indissoluble
the
bonds
which
hold
together
the
body
politic
are
not
sufficient
these
bonds
may
be
mentionedfor
instance
the
bond
of
patriotism
this
is
evidently
not
a
sufficient
bond
for
how
often
it
happens
that
people
of
the
same
nation
wage
civil
war
amongst
themselves
the
bond
of
fellowship
may
be
racial
but
history
proves
this
is
not
sufficiently
strong
for
tremendous
wars
have
broken
out
between
peoples
of
the
same
racial
lineage
again
the
bond
holding
men
together
may
be
political
how
often
it
happens
that
the
diplomacy
of
nations
makes
a
treaty
of
peace
one
day
and
on
the
morrow
a
declaration
of
war
it
is
historically
evident
and
manifest
that
these
bonds
are
not
selfsufficient
the
real
bond
of
integrity
is
religious
in
character
for
religion
indicates
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
religion
serves
the
world
of
morality
religion
purifies
the
hearts
religion
impels
men
to
achieve
praiseworthy
deeds
religion
becomes
the
cause
of
love
in
human
hearts
for
religion
is
a
divine
foundation
the
foundation
ever
conducive
to
life
the
teachings
of
god
are
the
source
of
illumination
to
the
people
of
the
world
religion
is
ever
constructive
not
destructive
the
foundation
of
all
the
divine
religions
is
one
all
are
based
upon
reality
reality
does
not
admit
plurality
yet
amongst
mankind
there
have
arisen
differences
concerning
the
manifestations
of
god
some
have
been
zoroastrians
some
are
buddhists
some
jews
christians
muslims
and
so
on
this
has
become
a
source
of
divergence
whereas
the
teachings
of
the
holy
souls
who
founded
the
divine
religions
are
one
in
essence
and
reality
all
these
have
served
the
world
of
humanity
all
have
summoned
souls
to
peace
and
accord
all
have
proclaimed
the
virtues
of
humanity
all
have
guided
souls
to
the
attainment
of
perfections
but
among
the
nations
certain
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
of
worship
have
arisen
these
imitations
are
not
the
foundation
and
essence
of
the
divine
religions
inasmuch
as
they
differ
from
the
reality
and
the
essential
teachings
of
the
manifestations
of
god
dissensions
have
arisen
and
prejudice
has
developed
religious
prejudice
thus
becomes
the
cause
of
warfare
and
battle
if
we
abandon
these
timeworn
blind
imitations
and
investigate
reality
all
of
us
will
be
unified
no
discord
will
remain
antagonism
will
disappear
all
will
associate
in
fellowship
all
will
enjoy
the
cordial
bonds
of
friendship
the
world
of
creation
will
then
attain
composure
the
dark
and
gloomy
clouds
of
blind
imitations
and
dogmatic
variances
will
be
scattered
and
dispelled
the
sun
of
reality
will
shine
most
gloriously
verily
we
should
consider
the
divine
prophets
as
the
intermediaries
but
mankind
has
made
use
of
them
as
causes
of
dissension
and
pretexts
for
warfare
and
strife
in
reality
they
were
the
intermediaries
of
love
and
reconciliation
if
they
were
not
sources
of
love
and
fellowship
amongst
men
then
undoubtedly
they
were
not
true
for
the
divine
wisdom
and
purpose
in
sending
the
prophets
was
the
manifestation
of
love
in
human
hearts
therefore
we
must
investigate
reality
first
of
all
let
us
determine
whether
these
prophets
were
valid
or
not
by
using
rational
proofs
and
shining
arguments
not
simply
by
quoting
traditionary
evidences
because
traditions
are
divergent
and
the
source
of
dissension
among
the
holy
divine
manifestations
of
god
was
moses
the
sending
of
prophets
has
ever
been
for
the
training
of
humanity
they
are
the
first
educators
and
trainers
if
moses
has
developed
the
body
politic
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
a
true
teacher
and
educator
this
will
be
proof
and
evidence
that
he
was
a
prophet
we
shall
consider
how
he
was
sent
to
the
children
of
israel
when
they
were
in
the
abyss
of
despair
in
the
lowest
degree
of
ignorance
and
heedlessness
degraded
and
under
conditions
of
bondage
moses
rescued
these
degraded
people
of
israel
from
that
state
of
bondage
he
raised
them
from
that
condition
of
ignorance
saved
them
from
barbarism
and
led
them
into
the
holy
land
he
educated
them
endowed
them
with
sagacious
instincts
made
them
worthy
and
honorable
he
civilized
them
raised
them
to
a
higher
plane
of
existence
until
they
were
enabled
to
establish
a
national
sovereignty
the
great
kingdom
of
solomon
this
proves
that
moses
was
a
teacher
and
an
educator
he
had
neither
army
nor
dominion
neither
did
he
possess
wealth
it
was
only
through
an
idealistic
power
that
he
cemented
them
together
proving
that
he
was
a
prophet
of
god
an
educator
and
trainer
likewise
must
we
set
aside
prejudice
in
considering
other
divine
educators
by
investigating
reality
for
instance
let
us
take
christ
he
achieved
results
greater
than
moses
he
educated
the
body
politic
trained
mighty
nations
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
such
souls
were
prophets
for
the
mission
of
prophethood
is
education
and
these
wondrous
souls
trained
and
educated
mankind
christ
was
a
unique
personage
without
helper
or
assistant
single
and
solitary
he
arose
to
train
great
and
mighty
nations
the
romans
greeks
egyptians
syrians
chaldeans
and
assyrians
came
under
his
influence
he
was
able
to
bind
together
many
nations
melting
them
together
as
it
were
and
pouring
them
into
one
mold
changing
their
enmity
into
love
war
into
peace
under
his
influence
satanic
souls
became
veritable
angels
tyrannical
rulers
became
just
the
human
moral
standard
was
raised
this
proves
that
christ
was
an
educator
a
teacher
and
trainer
of
nations
if
we
deny
this
it
is
nought
but
injustice
blessed
soulswhether
moses
jesus
zoroaster
krishna
buddha
confucius
or
muhammadwere
the
cause
of
the
illumination
of
the
world
of
humanity
how
can
we
deny
such
irrefutable
proof
how
can
we
be
blind
to
such
light
how
can
we
dispute
the
validity
of
christ
this
is
injustice
this
is
a
denial
of
reality
man
must
be
just
we
must
set
aside
bias
and
prejudice
we
must
abandon
the
imitations
of
ancestors
and
forefathers
we
ourselves
must
investigate
reality
and
be
fair
in
judgment
the
old
nation
of
persia
denied
all
these
facts
harboring
the
utmost
hatred
and
enmity
toward
other
religious
beliefs
besides
their
own
we
have
investigated
reality
and
found
that
these
holy
souls
were
all
sent
of
god
all
of
them
have
sacrificed
life
endured
ordeals
and
tribulations
in
order
that
they
might
educate
us
how
can
such
love
be
forgotten
the
light
of
christ
is
evident
the
candle
of
buddha
is
shining
the
star
of
moses
is
sparkling
the
flame
ignited
by
zoroaster
is
still
burning
how
can
we
deny
them
it
is
injustice
it
is
a
denial
of
complete
evidence
if
we
forsake
imitations
all
will
become
united
and
no
differences
will
remain
to
separate
us
we
entertain
no
prejudice
against
muhammad
outwardly
the
arabian
nation
was
instrumental
in
overthrowing
the
parsi
dominion
the
sovereignty
of
persia
therefore
the
old
parsi
nation
manifested
the
utmost
contempt
toward
the
arabs
but
we
deal
justly
and
will
never
abandon
the
standard
of
fairness
the
arabians
were
in
the
utmost
state
of
degradation
they
were
bloodthirsty
and
barbarous
so
savage
and
degraded
that
the
arabian
father
often
buried
his
own
daughter
alive
consider
could
any
barbarism
be
lower
than
this
the
nation
consisted
of
warring
hostile
tribal
peoples
inhabiting
the
vast
arabian
peninsula
and
their
business
consisted
in
fighting
and
pillaging

muhammad
appeared
among
such
a
people
he
educated
and
unified
these
barbarous
tribes
put
an
end
to
their
shedding
of
blood
through
his
education
they
reached
such
a
degree
of
civilization
that
they
subdued
and
governed
continents
and
nations
what
a
great
civilization
was
established
in
spain
by
the
muslims
what
a
marvelous
civilization
was
founded
in
morocco
by
the
moors
what
a
powerful
caliphate
or
successorship
was
set
up
in
baghdad
how
much
islam
served
and
furthered
the
cause
of
science
why
then
should
we
deny
muhammad
if
we
deny
him
we
awaken
enmity
and
hatred
by
our
prejudice
we
become
the
cause
of
war
and
bloodshed
for
prejudice
was
the
cause
of
the
tremendous
storm
which
swept
through
human
history
for
thirteen
hundred
years
and
still
continues
even
now
in
the
balkans
a
commotion
is
apparent
reflecting
it
the
christian
people
number
nearly
three
hundred
millions
and
the
muslims
about
the
same
it
is
no
small
task
to
do
away
with
such
numbers
and
furthermore
why
should
they
be
obliterated
for
these
are
all
servants
of
the
one
god
let
us
strive
to
establish
peace
between
christians
and
muslims
is
it
not
better
what
is
the
benefit
of
war
what
is
its
fruitage
for
thirteen
hundred
years
there
has
been
warfare
and
hostility
what
good
result
has
been
forthcoming
is
it
not
folly
is
god
pleased
with
it
is
christ
pleased
is
muhammad
it
is
evident
that
they
are
not
the
prophets
have
extolled
each
other
to
the
utmost
muhammad
declared
christ
to
be
the
spirit
of
god
this
is
an
explicit
text
of
the
quran
he
declared
christ
to
be
the
word
of
god
he
eulogized
the
disciples
of
christ
to
the
utmost
he
bestowed
upon
mary
the
mother
of
christ
the
highest
praise
likewise
christ
extolled
moses
he
spread
broadcast
the
old
testament
the
torah
and
caused
the
name
of
moses
to
reach
unto
the
east
and
the
west
the
purpose
is
this
that
the
prophets
themselves
have
manifested
the
utmost
love
toward
each
other
but
the
nations
who
believe
and
follow
them
are
hostile
and
antagonistic
among
themselves
the
world
was
in
this
condition
of
darkness
when
bahaullah
appeared
upon
the
persian
horizon
he
hoisted
the
banner
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
he
proclaimed
international
peace
he
admonished
the
persian
nation
to
investigate
reality
announced
that
religion
must
be
the
cause
of
unity
and
love
that
it
must
be
the
means
of
binding
hearts
together
the
cause
of
life
and
illumination
if
religion
becomes
the
cause
of
enmity
and
bloodshed
then
irreligion
is
to
be
preferred
for
religion
is
the
remedy
for
every
ailment
and
if
a
remedy
should
become
the
cause
of
ailment
and
difficulty
it
is
better
to
abandon
it
today
in
persia
you
will
see
the
muslims
christians
zoroastrians
buddhists
assembled
together
in
the
same
meeting
living
in
accordance
with
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
manifesting
utmost
love
and
accord
rancor
hatred
antagonism
and
violence
have
disappeared
they
live
together
as
one
family
and
ye
who
are
the
people
of
the
orientthe
orient
which
has
ever
been
the
dawning
point
of
lights
from
whence
the
sun
of
reality
has
ever
shone
forth
casting
its
effulgence
upon
the

therefore
must
become
the
manifestations
of
lights
ye
must
become

ye
must
shine
as

radiating
the
light
of
love
toward
all
mankind
may
you
be
the
cause
of
love
amongst
the
nations
thus
may
the
world
become
witness
that
the
orient
has
ever
been
the
dawning
point
of
illumination
the
source
of
love
and
reconciliation

must
we
be

the
greatest
attainment
in
the
world
of
humanity
has
ever
been
scientific
in
nature
it
is
the
discovery
of
the
realities
of
things
inasmuch
as
i
find
myself
in
the
home
of
sciencefor
this
is
one
of
the
great
universities
of
the
country
and
well
known
abroadi
feel
a
keen
sense
of
joy
the
highest
praise
is
due
to
men
who
devote
their
energies
to
science
and
the
noblest
center
is
a
center
wherein
the
sciences
and
arts
are
taught
and
studied
science
ever
tends
to
the
illumination
of
the
world
of
humanity
it
is
the
cause
of
eternal
honor
to
man
and
its
sovereignty
is
far
greater
than
the
sovereignty
of
kings
the
dominion
of
kings
has
an
ending
the
king
himself
may
be
dethroned
but
the
sovereignty
of
science
is
everlasting
and
without
end
consider
the
philosophers
of
former
times
their
rule
and
dominion
is
still
manifest
in
the
world
the
greek
and
roman
kingdoms
with
all
their
grandeur
passed
away
the
ancient
sovereignties
of
the
orient
are
but
memories
whereas
the
power
and
influence
of
plato
and
aristotle
still
continue
even
now
in
schools
and
universities
of
the
world
their
names
are
revered
and
commemorated
but
where
do
we
hear
the
names
of
bygone
kings
extolled
they
are
forgotten
and
rest
in
the
valley
of
oblivion
it
is
evident
that
the
sovereignty
of
science
is
greater
than
the
dominion
of
rulers
kings
have
invaded
countries
and
achieved
conquest
through
the
shedding
of
blood
but
the
scientist
through
his
beneficent
achievements
invades
the
regions
of
ignorance
conquering
the
realm
of
minds
and
hearts
therefore
his
conquests
are
everlasting
may
you
attain
extraordinary
progress
in
this
center
of
education
may
you
become
radiant
lights
flooding
the
dark
regions
and
recesses
of
ignorance
with
illumination
inasmuch
as
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
i
will
speak
to
you
upon
the
intrinsic
oneness
of
all
phenomena
this
is
one
of
the
abstruse
subjects
of
divine
philosophy
fundamentally
all
existing
things
pass
through
the
same
degrees
and
phases
of
development
and
any
given
phenomenon
embodies
all
others
an
ancient
statement
of
the
arabian
philosophers
declares
that
all
things
are
involved
in
all
things
it
is
evident
that
each
material
organism
is
an
aggregate
expression
of
single
and
simple
elements
and
a
given
cellular
element
or
atom
has
its
coursings
or
journeyings
through
various
and
myriad
stages
of
life
for
example
we
will
say
the
cellular
elements
which
have
entered
into
the
composition
of
a
human
organism
were
at
one
time
a
component
part
of
the
animal
kingdom
at
another
time
they
entered
into
the
composition
of
the
vegetable
and
prior
to
that
they
existed
in
the
kingdom
of
the
mineral
they
have
been
subject
to
transference
from
one
condition
of
life
to
another
passing
through
various
forms
and
phases
exercising
in
each
existence
special
functions
their
journeyings
through
material
phenomena
are
continuous
therefore
each
phenomenon
is
the
expression
in
degree
of
all
other
phenomena
the
difference
is
one
of
successive
transferences
and
the
period
of
time
involved
in
evolutionary
process
for
example
it
has
taken
a
certain
length
of
time
for
this
cellular
element
in
my
hand
to
pass
through
the
various
periods
of
metabolism
at
one
period
it
was
in
the
mineral
kingdom
subject
to
changes
and
transferences
in
the
mineral
state
then
it
was
transferred
to
the
vegetable
kingdom
where
it
entered
into
different
grades
and
stations
afterward
it
reached
the
animal
plane
appearing
in
forms
of
animal
organisms
until
finally
in
its
transferences
and
coursings
it
attained
to
the
kingdom
of
man
later
on
it
will
revert
to
its
primordial
elemental
state
in
the
mineral
kingdom
being
subject
as
it
were
to
infinite
journeyings
from
one
degree
of
existence
to
another
passing
through
every
stage
of
being
and
life
whenever
it
appears
in
any
distinct
form
or
image
it
has
its
opportunities
virtues
and
functions
as
each
component
atom
or
element
in
the
physical
organisms
of
existence
is
subject
to
transference
through
endless
forms
and
stages
possessing
virtues
peculiar
to
those
forms
and
stations
it
is
evident
that
all
phenomena
of
material
being
are
fundamentally
one
in
the
mineral
kingdom
this
component
atom
or
element
possesses
certain
virtues
of
the
mineral
in
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
it
is
imbued
with
vegetable
qualities
or
virtues
in
the
plane
of
animal
existence
it
is
empowered
with
animal
virtuesthe
senses
and
in
the
kingdom
of
man
it
manifests
qualities
peculiar
to
the
human
station
as
this
is
true
of
material
phenomena
how
much
more
evident
and
essential
it
is
that
oneness
should
characterize
man
in
the
realm
of
idealism
which
finds
its
expression
only
in
the
human
kingdom
verily
the
origin
of
all
material
life
is
one
and
its
termination
likewise
one
in
view
of
this
fundamental
unity
and
agreement
of
all
phenomenal
life
why
should
man
in
his
kingdom
of
existence
wage
war
or
indulge
in
hostility
and
destructive
strife
against
his
fellowman
man
is
the
noblest
of
the
creatures
in
his
physical
organism
he
possesses
the
virtues
of
the
mineral
kingdom
likewise
he
embodies
the
augmentative
virtue
or
power
of
growth
which
characterizes
the
kingdom
of
the
vegetable
furthermore
in
his
degree
of
physical
existence
he
is
qualified
with
functions
and
powers
peculiar
to
the
animal
beyond
which
lies
the
range
of
his
distinctive
human
mental
and
spiritual
endowment
considering
this
wonderful
unity
of
the
kingdoms
of
existence
and
their
embodiment
in
the
highest
and
noblest
creature
why
should
man
be
at
variance
and
in
conflict
with
man
is
it
fitting
and
justifiable
that
he
should
be
at
war
when
harmony
and
interdependence
characterize
the
kingdoms
of
phenomenal
life
below
him
the
elements
and
lower
organisms
are
synchronized
in
the
great
plan
of
life
shall
man
infinitely
above
them
in
degree
be
antagonistic
and
a
destroyer
of
that
perfection
god
forbid
such
a
condition
from
the
fellowship
and
commingling
of
the
elemental
atoms
life
results
in
their
harmony
and
blending
there
is
ever
newness
of
existence
it
is
radiance
completeness
it
is
consummation
it
is
life
itself
just
now
the
physical
energies
and
natural
forces
which
come
under
our
immediate
observation
are
all
at
peace
the
sun
is
at
peace
with
the
earth
upon
which
it
shines
the
soft
breathing
winds
are
at
peace
with
the
trees
all
the
elements
are
in
harmony
and
equilibrium
a
slight
disturbance
and
discord
among
them
might
bring
another
san
francisco
earthquake
and
fire
a
physical
clash
a
little
quarreling
among
the
elements
as
it
were
and
a
violent
cataclysm
of
nature
results
this
happens
in
the
mineral
kingdom
consider
then
the
effect
of
discord
and
conflict
in
the
kingdom
of
man
so
superior
to
the
realm
of
inanimate
existence
how
great
the
attendant
catastrophe
especially
when
we
realize
that
man
is
endowed
by
god
with
mind
and
intellect
verily
mind
is
the
supreme
gift
of
god
verily
intellect
is
the
effulgence
of
god
this
is
manifest
and
selfevident
for
all
created
things
except
man
are
subjects
or
captives
of
nature
they
cannot
deviate
in
the
slightest
degree
from
natures
law
and
control
the
colossal
sun
center
of
our
planetary
system
is
natures
captive
incapable
of
the
least
variation
from
the
law
of
command
all
the
orbs
and
luminaries
in
this
illimitable
universe
are
likewise
obedient
to
natures
regulation
our
planet
the
earth
acknowledges
natures
omnipresent
sovereignty
the
kingdoms
of
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
respond
to
natures
will
and
fiat
of
control
the
great
bulky
elephant
with
its
massive
strength
has
no
power
to
disobey
the
restrictions
nature
has
laid
upon
him
but
man
weak
and
diminutive
in
comparison
empowered
by
mind
which
is
an
effulgence
of
divinity
itself
can
resist
natures
control
and
apply
natural
laws
to
his
own
uses
according
to
the
limitations
of
his
physical
powers
man
was
intended
by
creation
to
live
upon
the
earth
but
through
the
exercise
of
his
mental
faculties
he
removes
the
restriction
of
this
law
and
soars
in
the
air
like
a
bird
he
penetrates
the
secrets
of
the
sea
in
submarines
and
builds
fleets
to
sail
at
will
over
the
oceans
surface
commanding
the
laws
of
nature
to
do
his
will
all
the
sciences
and
arts
we
now
enjoy
and
utilize
were
once
mysteries
and
according
to
the
mandates
of
nature
should
have
remained
hidden
and
latent
but
the
human
intellect
has
broken
through
the
laws
surrounding
them
and
discovered
the
underlying
realities
the
mind
of
man
has
taken
these
mysteries
out
of
the
plane
of
invisibility
and
brought
them
into
the
plane
of
the
known
and
visible
it
has
classified
and
adapted
these
laws
to
human
needs
and
uses
this
being
contrary
to
the
postulates
of
nature
for
example
electricity
was
once
a
hidden
or
latent
natural
force
it
would
have
remained
hidden
if
the
human
intellect
had
not
discovered
it
man
has
broken
the
law
of
its
concealment
taken
this
energy
out
of
the
invisible
treasury
of
the
universe
and
brought
it
into
visibility
is
it
not
an
extraordinary
accomplishment
that
this
little
creature
man
has
imprisoned
an
irresistible
cosmic
force
in
an
incandescent
lamp
it
is
beyond
the
vision
and
power
of
nature
itself
to
do
this
the
east
can
communicate
with
the
west
in
a
few
minutes
this
is
a
miracle
transcending
natures
control
man
takes
the
human
voice
and
stores
it
in
a
phonograph
the
voice
naturally
should
be
free
and
transient
according
to
the
law
and
phenomenon
of
sound
but
man
arrests
its
vibrations
and
puts
it
in
a
box
in
defiance
of
natures
laws
all
human
discoveries
were
once
secrets
and
mysteries
sealed
and
stored
up
in
the
bosom
of
the
material
universe
until
the
mind
of
man
which
is
the
greatest
of
divine
effulgences
penetrated
them
and
made
them
subservient
to
his
will
and
purpose
in
this
sense
man
has
broken
the
laws
of
nature
and
is
constantly
taking
out
of
natures
laboratory
new
and
wonderful
things
notwithstanding
this
supreme
bestowal
of
god
which
is
the
greatest
power
in
the
world
of
creation
man
continues
to
war
and
fight
killing
his
fellowman
with
the
ferocity
of
a
wild
animal
is
this
in
keeping
with
his
exalted
station
nay
rather
this
is
contrary
to
the
divine
purpose
manifest
in
his
creation
and
endowment
if
the
animals
are
savage
and
ferocious
it
is
simply
a
means
for
their
subsistence
and
preservation
they
are
deprived
of
that
degree
of
intellect
which
can
reason
and
discriminate
between
right
and
wrong
justice
and
injustice
they
are
justified
in
their
actions
and
not
responsible
when
man
is
ferocious
and
cruel
toward
his
fellowman
it
is
not
for
subsistence
or
safety
his
motive
is
selfish
advantage
and
willful
wrong
it
is
neither
seemly
nor
befitting
that
such
a
noble
creature
endowed
with
intellect
and
lofty
thoughts
capable
of
wonderful
achievements
and
discoveries
in
sciences
and
arts
with
potential
for
ever
higher
perceptions
and
the
accomplishment
of
divine
purposes
in
life
should
seek
the
blood
of
his
fellowmen
upon
the
field
of
battle
man
is
the
temple
of
god
he
is
not
a
human
temple
if
you
destroy
a
house
the
owner
of
that
house
will
be
grieved
and
wrathful
how
much
greater
is
the
wrong
when
man
destroys
a
building
planned
and
erected
by
god
undoubtedly
he
deserves
the
judgment
and
wrath
of
god
god
has
created
man
lofty
and
noble
made
him
a
dominant
factor
in
creation
he
has
specialized
man
with
supreme
bestowals
conferred
upon
him
mind
perception
memory
abstraction
and
the
powers
of
the
senses
these
gifts
of
god
to
man
were
intended
to
make
him
the
manifestation
of
divine
virtues
a
radiant
light
in
the
world
of
creation
a
source
of
life
and
the
agency
of
constructiveness
in
the
infinite
fields
of
existence
shall
we
now
destroy
this
great
edifice
and
its
very
foundation
overthrow
this
temple
of
god
the
body
social
or
politic
when
we
are
not
captives
of
nature
when
we
possess
the
power
to
control
ourselves
shall
we
become
captives
of
nature
and
act
according
to
its
exigencies
in
nature
there
is
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
even
if
man
be
not
educated
then
according
to
the
natural
institutes
this
natural
law
will
demand
of
man
supremacy
the
purpose
and
object
of
schools
colleges
and
universities
is
to
educate
man
and
thereby
rescue
and
redeem
him
from
the
exigencies
and
defects
of
nature
and
to
awaken
within
him
the
capability
of
controlling
and
appropriating
natures
bounties
if
we
should
relegate
this
plot
of
ground
to
its
natural
state
allow
it
to
return
to
its
original
condition
it
would
become
a
field
of
thorns
and
useless
weeds
but
by
cultivation
it
will
become
fertile
soil
yielding
a
harvest
deprived
of
cultivation
the
mountain
slopes
would
be
jungles
and
forests
without
fruitful
trees
the
gardens
bring
forth
fruits
and
flowers
in
proportion
to
the
care
and
tillage
bestowed
upon
them
by
the
gardener
therefore
it
is
not
intended
that
the
world
of
humanity
should
be
left
to
its
natural
state
it
is
in
need
of
the
education
divinely
provided
for
it
the
holy
heavenly
manifestations
of
god
have
been
the
teachers
they
are
the
divine
gardeners
who
transform
the
jungles
of
human
nature
into
fruitful
orchards
and
make
the
thorny
places
blossom
as
the
rose
it
is
evident
then
that
the
intended
and
especial
function
of
man
is
to
rescue
and
redeem
himself
from
the
inherent
defects
of
nature
and
become
qualified
with
the
ideal
virtues
of
divinity
shall
he
sacrifice
these
ideal
virtues
and
destroy
these
possibilities
of
advancement
god
has
endowed
him
with
a
power
whereby
he
can
even
overcome
the
laws
and
phenomena
of
nature
wrest
the
sword
from
natures
hand
and
use
it
against
nature
itself
shall
he
then
remain
its
captive
even
failing
to
qualify
under
the
natural
law
which
commands
the
survival
of
the
fittest
that
is
to
say
shall
he
continue
to
live
upon
the
level
of
the
animal
kingdom
without
distinction
between
them
and
himself
in
natural
impulses
and
ferocious
instincts
there
is
no
lower
degree
nor
greater
debasement
for
man
than
this
natural
condition
of
animalism
the
battlefield
is
the
acme
of
human
degradation
the
cause
of
the
wrath
of
god
the
destruction
of
the
divine
foundation
of
man
praise
be
to
god
i
find
myself
in
an
assemblage
the
members
of
which
are
peace
loving
and
advocates
of
international
unity
the
thoughts
of
all
present
are
centered
upon
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
mankind
and
every
ambition
is
to
render
service
in
the
cause
of
human
uplift
and
betterment
i
supplicate
god
that
he
may
confirm
and
assist
you
that
each
one
of
you
may
become
a
professor
emeritus
in
the
world
of
scientific
knowledge
a
faithful
standardbearer
of
peace
and
bonds
of
agreement
between
the
hearts
of
men
fifty
years
ago
bahaullah
declared
the
necessity
of
peace
among
the
nations
and
the
reality
of
reconciliation
between
the
religions
of
the
world
he
announced
that
the
fundamental
basis
of
all
religion
is
one
that
the
essence
of
religion
is
human
fellowship
and
that
the
differences
in
belief
which
exist
are
due
to
dogmatic
interpretation
and
blind
imitations
which
are
at
variance
with
the
foundations
established
by
the
prophets
of
god
he
proclaimed
that
if
the
reality
underlying
religious
teaching
be
investigated
all
religions
would
be
unified
and
the
purpose
of
god
which
is
love
and
the
blending
of
human
hearts
would
be
accomplished
according
to
his
teachings
if
religious
belief
proves
to
be
the
cause
of
discord
and
dissension
its
absence
would
be
preferable
for
religion
was
intended
to
be
the
divine
remedy
and
panacea
for
the
ailments
of
humanity
the
healing
balm
for
the
wounds
of
mankind
if
its
misapprehension
and
defilement
have
brought
about
warfare
and
bloodshed
instead
of
remedy
and
cure
the
world
would
be
better
under
irreligious
conditions
bahaullah
especially
emphasized
international
peace
he
declared
that
all
mankind
is
the
one
progeny
of
adam
and
members
of
one
great
universal
family
if
the
various
races
and
distinct
types
of
mankind
had
each
proceeded
from
a
different
original
paternityin
other
words
if
we
had
two
or
more
adams
for
our
human
fathersthere
might
be
reasonable
ground
for
difference
and
divergence
in
humanity
today
but
inasmuch
as
we
belong
to
one
progeny
and
one
family
all
names
which
seek
to
differentiate
and
distinguish
mankind
as
italian
german
french
russian
and
so
on
are
without
significance
and
sanction
we
are
all
human
all
servants
of
god
and
all
come
from
mr
adams
family
why
then
all
these
fallacious
national
and
racial
distinctions
these
boundary
lines
and
artificial
barriers
have
been
created
by
despots
and
conquerors
who
sought
to
attain
dominion
over
mankind
thereby
engendering
patriotic
feeling
and
rousing
selfish
devotion
to
merely
local
standards
of
government
as
a
rule
they
themselves
enjoyed
luxuries
in
palaces
surrounded
by
conditions
of
ease
and
affluence
while
armies
of
soldiers
civilians
and
tillers
of
the
soil
fought
and
died
at
their
command
upon
the
field
of
battle
shedding
their
innocent
blood
for
a
delusion
such
as
we
are
germans
our
enemies
are
french
etc
when
in
reality
all
are
humankind
all
belong
to
the
one
family
and
posterity
of
adam
the
original
father
this
prejudice
or
limited
patriotism
is
prevalent
throughout
the
world
while
man
is
blind
to
patriotism
in
the
larger
sense
which
includes
all
races
and
native
lands
from
every
real
standpoint
there
must
and
should
be
peace
among
all
nations
god
created
one
earth
and
one
mankind
to
people
it
man
has
no
other
habitation
but
man
himself
has
come
forth
and
proclaimed
imaginary
boundary
lines
and
territorial
restrictions
naming
them
germany
france
russia
etc
and
torrents
of
precious
blood
are
spilled
in
defense
of
these
imaginary
divisions
of
our
one
human
habitation
under
the
delusion
of
a
fancied
and
limited
patriotism
after
all
a
claim
and
title
to
territory
or
native
land
is
but
a
claim
and
attachment
to
the
dust
of
earth
we
live
upon
this
earth
for
a
few
days
and
then
rest
beneath
it
forever
so
it
is
our
graveyard
eternally
shall
man
fight
for
the
tomb
which
devours
him
for
his
eternal
sepulcher
what
ignorance
could
be
greater
than
this
to
fight
over
his
grave
to
kill
another
for
his
grave
what
heedlessness
what
a
delusion
it
is
my
hope
that
you
who
are
students
in
this
university
may
never
be
called
upon
to
fight
for
the
dust
of
earth
which
is
the
tomb
and

of
all

that

notes
by
bijou
straun
although
i
was
feeling
indisposed
this
evening
yet
owing
to
the
love
i
entertain
for
you
i
have
attended
this
meeting
for
i
have
heard
that
this
is
an
open
forum
investigating
reality
that
you
are
free
from
blind
imitations
desiring
to
arrive
at
the
truth
of
things
and
that
your
endeavors
are
lofty
therefore
i
have
thought
it
expedient
to
discourse
upon
the
subject
of
philosophy
which
is
alike
interesting
to
the
east
and
the
west
enabling
us
to
consider
the
analogies
and
differences
between
the
philosophical
teachings
of
the
orient
and
occident
the
criterion
of
judgment
in
the
estimation
of
western
philosophers
is
sense
perception
they
consider
that
which
is
tangible
or
perceptible
to
the
senses
to
be
a
realitythat
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
existence
for
example
we
prove
the
existence
of
this
light
through
the
sense
of
sight
we
visualize
this
room
we
see
the
sun
the
green
fields
we
use
our
sense
of
sight
to
observe
them
the
opinion
of
these
philosophers
is
that
such
perception
is
reality
that
the
senses
are
the
highest
standard
of
perception
and
judgment
in
which
there
can
neither
be
doubt
nor
uncertainty
in
the
estimation
of
the
philosophers
of
the
orient
especially
those
of
greece
and
persia
the
standard
of
judgment
is
the
intellect
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
criterion
of
the
senses
is
defective
and
their
proof
is
that
the
senses
are
often
deceived
and
mistaken
that
which
is
liable
to
mistake
cannot
be
infallible
cannot
be
a
true
standard
of
judgment
among
the
senses
the
most
powerful
and
reliable
is
that
of
sight
this
sense
views
a
mirage
as
a
body
of
water
and
is
positive
as
to
its
character
whereas
a
mirage
is
nonexistent
the
sense
of
vision
or
sight
sees
reflected
images
in
a
mirror
as
verities
when
reason
declares
them
to
be
nonexistent
the
eye
sees
the
sun
and
planets
revolving
around
the
earth
whereas
in
reality
the
sun
is
stationary
central
and
the
earth
revolves
upon
its
own
axis
the
sense
of
sight
sees
the
earth
as
a
plane
whereas
the
faculty
of
reason
discovers
it
to
be
spherical
the
eye
views
the
heavenly
bodies
in
boundless
space
as
small
and
insignificant
whereas
reason
declares
them
to
be
colossal
suns
the
sense
of
sight
beholds
a
whirling
spark
of
fire
as
a
circle
of
light
and
is
without
doubt
as
to
it
whereas
such
a
circle
is
nonexistent
a
man
sailing
in
a
ship
sees
the
banks
on
either
side
as
if
they
were
moving
whereas
the
ship
is
moving
briefly
there
are
many
instances
and
evidences
which
disprove
the
assertion
that
tangibilities
and
sense
impressions
are
certainties
for
the
senses
are
misleading
and
often
mistaken
how
then
can
we
rightly
declare
that
they
prove
reality
when
the
standard
or
criterion
itself
is
defective
the
philosophers
of
the
east
consider
the
perfect
criterion
to
be
reason
or
intellect
and
according
to
that
standard
the
realities
of
all
objects
can
be
proved
for
they
say
the
standard
of
reason
and
intellect
is
perfect
and
everything
provable
through
reason
is
veritable
therefore
those
philosophers
consider
all
philosophical
deductions
to
be
correct
when
weighed
according
to
the
standard
of
reason
and
they
state
that
the
senses
are
the
assistants
and
instruments
of
reason
and
that
although
the
investigation
of
realities
may
be
conducted
through
the
senses
the
standard
of
knowing
and
judgment
is
reason
itself
in
this
way
the
philosophers
of
the
east
and
west
differ
and
disagree
the
materialistic
philosophers
of
the
west
declare
that
man
belongs
to
the
animal
kingdom
whereas
the
philosophers
of
the
eastsuch
as
plato
aristotle
and
the
persiansdivide
the
world
of
existence
or
phenomena
of
life
into
two
general
categories
or
kingdoms
one
the
animal
kingdom
or
world
of
nature
the
other
the
human
kingdom
or
world
of
reason
man
is
distinguished
above
the
animals
through
his
reason
the
perceptions
of
man
are
of
two
kinds
tangible
or
sensible
and
reasonable
whereas
the
animal
perceptions
are
limited
to
the
senses
the
tangible
only
the
tangible
perceptions
may
be
likened
to
this
candle
the
reasonable
perceptions
to
the
light
calculations
of
mathematical
problems
and
determining
the
spherical
form
of
the
earth
are
through
the
reasonable
perceptions
the
center
of
gravity
is
a
hypothesis
of
reason
reason
itself
is
not
tangible
perceptible
to
the
senses
reason
is
an
intellectual
verity
or
reality
all
qualities
are
ideal
realities
not
tangible
realities
for
instance
we
say
this
man
is
a
scholarly
man
knowledge
is
an
ideal
attainment
not
perceptible
to
the
senses
when
you
see
this
scholarly
man
your
eye
does
not
see
his
knowledge
your
ear
cannot
hear
his
science
nor
can
you
sense
it
by
taste
it
is
not
a
tangible
verity
science
itself
is
an
ideal
verity
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
perceptions
of
man
are
twofold
the
reasonable
and
the
tangible
or
sensible
as
to
the
animal
it
is
endowed
only
with
sense
perception
it
is
lacking
the
reasonable
perception
it
cannot
apprehend
ideal
realities
the
animal
cannot
conceive
of
the
earth
as
a
sphere
the
intelligence
of
an
animal
located
in
europe
could
never
have
planned
the
discovery
of
the
continent
of
america
the
animal
kingdom
is
incapable
of
discovering
the
latent
mysteries
of
naturesuch
as
electricityand
bringing
them
forth
from
the
invisible
to
the
plane
of
visibility
it
is
evident
that
the
discoveries
and
inventions
transcend
the
animal
intelligence
the
animal
cannot
penetrate
the
secrets
of
genesis
and
creation
its
mind
is
incapable
of
conceiving
the
verity
of
ether
it
cannot
know
the
mysteries
of
magnetism
because
the
bestowals
of
abstract
reason
and
intellect
are
absent
in
its
endowment
that
is
to
say
the
animal
in
its
creation
is
a
captive
of
the
senses
beyond
the
tangibilities
and
impressions
of
the
senses
it
cannot
accept
anything
it
denies
everything
it
is
incapable
of
ideal
perception
and
therefore
a
captive
of
the
senses
virtue
or
perfection
belongs
to
man
who
possesses
both
the
capacity
of
the
senses
and
ideal
perception
for
instance
astronomical
discoveries
are
mans
accomplishments
he
has
not
gained
this
knowledge
through
his
senses
the
greater
part
of
it
has
been
attained
through
intellect
through
the
ideal
senses
mans
inventions
have
appeared
through
the
avenue
of
his
reasonable
faculties
all
his
scientific
attainments
have
come
through
the
faculty
of
reason
briefly
the
evidences
of
intellect
or
reason
are
manifest
in
man
by
them
he
is
differentiated
from
the
animal
therefore
the
animal
kingdom
is
distinct
and
inferior
to
the
human
kingdom
notwithstanding
this
the
philosophers
of
the
west
have
certain
syllogisms
or
demonstrations
whereby
they
endeavor
to
prove
that
man
had
his
origin
in
the
animal
kingdom
that
although
he
is
now
a
vertebrate
he
originally
lived
in
the
sea
from
thence
he
was
transferred
to
the
land
and
became
vertebrate
that
gradually
his
feet
and
hands
appeared
in
his
anatomical
development
then
he
began
to
walk
upon
all
fours
after
which
he
attained
to
human
stature
walking
erect
they
find
that
his
anatomy
has
undergone
successive
changes
finally
assuming
human
form
and
that
these
intermediate
forms
or
changes
are
like
links
connected
between
man
and
the
ape
however
there
is
one
link
missing
and
to
the
present
time
scientists
have
not
been
able
to
discover
it
therefore
the
greatest
proof
of
this
western
theory
of
human
evolution
is
anatomical
reasoning
that
there
are
certain
vestiges
of
organs
found
in
man
which
are
peculiar
to
the
ape
and
lower
animals
and
setting
forth
the
conclusion
that
man
at
some
time
in
his
upward
progression
has
possessed
these
organs
which
are
no
longer
functioning
but
appear
now
as
mere
rudiments
and
vestiges
for
example
a
serpent
has
a
certain
appendage
which
indicates
that
at
one
time
it
was
possessed
of
long
limbs
but
as
this
creature
began
to
find
its
habitation
in
the
holes
of
the
earth
these
limbs
no
longer
needed
became
atrophied
and
shrunk
leaving
but
a
vestige
or
appendage
as
an
evidence
of
the
time
when
they
were
lengthy
and
serviceable
likewise
it
is
claimed
man
had
a
certain
appendage
which
shows
that
there
was
a
time
when
his
anatomical
structure
was
different
from
his
present
organism
and
that
there
has
been
a
corresponding
transformation
or
change
in
that
structure
the
coccyx
or
extremity
of
the
human
spinal
column
is
declared
to
be
the
vestige
of
a
tail
which
man
formerly
possessed
but
which
gradually
disappeared
when
he
walked
erect
and
its
utility
ceased
these
statements
and
demonstrations
express
the
substance
of
western
philosophy
upon
the
question
of
human
evolution
the
philosophers
of
the
orient
in
reply
to
those
of
the
western
world
say
let
us
suppose
that
the
human
anatomy
was
primordially
different
from
its
present
form
that
it
was
gradually
transformed
from
one
stage
to
another
until
it
attained
its
present
likeness
that
at
one
time
it
was
similar
to
a
fish
later
an
invertebrate
and
finally
human
this
anatomical
evolution
or
progression
does
not
alter
or
affect
the
statement
that
the
development
of
man
was
always
human
in
type
and
biological
in
progression
for
the
human
embryo
when
examined
microscopically
is
at
first
a
mere
germ
or
worm
gradually
as
it
develops
it
shows
certain
divisions
rudiments
of
hands
and
feet
appearthat
is
to
say
an
upper
and
a
lower
part
are
distinguishable
afterward
it
undergoes
certain
distinct
changes
until
it
reaches
its
actual
human
form
and
is
born
into
this
world
but
at
all
times
even
when
the
embryo
resembled
a
worm
it
was
human
in
potentiality
and
character
not
animal
the
forms
assumed
by
the
human
embryo
in
its
successive
changes
do
not
prove
that
it
is
animal
in
its
essential
character
throughout
this
progression
there
has
been
a
transference
of
type
a
conservation
of
species
or
kind
realizing
this
we
may
acknowledge
the
fact
that
at
one
time
man
was
an
inmate
of
the
sea
at
another
period
an
invertebrate
then
a
vertebrate
and
finally
a
human
being
standing
erect
though
we
admit
these
changes
we
cannot
say
man
is
an
animal
in
each
one
of
these
stages
are
signs
and
evidences
of
his
human
existence
and
destination
proof
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
the
embryo
man
still
resembles
a
worm
this
embryo
still
progresses
from
one
state
to
another
assuming
different
forms
until
that
which
was
potential
in
itnamely
the
human
imageappears
therefore
in
the
protoplasm
man
is
man
conservation
of
species
demands
it
the
lost
link
of
darwinian
theory
is
itself
a
proof
that
man
is
not
an
animal
how
is
it
possible
to
have
all
the
links
present
and
that
important
link
absent
its
absence
is
an
indication
that
man
has
never
been
an
animal
it
will
never
be
found
the
significance
is
this
that
the
world
of
humanity
is
distinct
from
the
animal
kingdom
this
is
the
teaching
of
the
philosophers
of
the
orient
they
have
a
proof
for
it
the
proof
is
that
the
animals
are
captives
of
nature
all
existence
and
phenomena
of
the
lower
kingdoms
are
captives
of
nature
the
mighty
sun
the
numberless
stars
the
kingdoms
of
the
vegetable
and
mineral
none
of
these
can
deviate
one
hairs
breadth
from
the
limitation
of
natures
laws
they
are
as
it
were
arrested
by
natures
hands
but
man
breaks
the
laws
of
nature
and
makes
them
subservient
to
his
uses
for
instance
man
is
an
animate
earthly
being
in
common
with
the
animals
the
exigency
of
nature
demands
that
he
should
be
restricted
to
the
earth
but
he
by
breaking
the
laws
of
nature
soars
in
the
atmosphere
high
above
it
by
the
application
of
his
intellect
he
overcomes
natural
law
and
dives
beneath
the
seas
in
submarines
or
sails
across
them
in
ships
he
arrests
a
mighty
force
of
nature
such
as
electricity
and
imprisons
it
in
an
incandescent
lamp
according
to
the
law
of
nature
he
should
be
able
to
communicate
at
a
distance
of
say
one
thousand
feet
but
through
his
inventions
and
discoveries
he
communicates
with
the
east
and
with
the
west
in
a
few
moments
this
is
breaking
the
laws
of
nature
man
arrests
the
human
voice
and
reproduces
it
in
a
phonograph
at
most
his
voice
should
be
heard
only
a
few
hundred
feet
away
but
he
invents
an
instrument
which
transmits
it
one
thousand
miles
in
brief
all
the
present
arts
and
sciences
inventions
and
discoveries
man
has
brought
forth
were
once
mysteries
which
nature
had
decreed
should
remain
hidden
and
latent
but
man
has
taken
them
out
of
the
plane
of
the
invisible
and
brought
them
into
the
plane
of
the
visible
this
is
contrary
to
natures
laws
electricity
should
be
a
latent
mystery
but
man
discovers
it
and
makes
it
his
servant
he
wrests
the
sword
from
natures
hand
and
uses
it
against
nature
proving
that
there
is
a
power
in
him
which
is
beyond
nature
for
it
is
capable
of
breaking
and
subduing
the
laws
of
nature
if
this
power
were
not
supernatural
and
extraordinary
mans
accomplishments
would
not
have
been
possible
furthermore
it
is
evident
that
in
the
world
of
nature
conscious
knowledge
is
absent
nature
is
without
knowing
whereas
man
is
conscious
nature
is
devoid
of
memory
man
possesses
memory
nature
is
without
perception
and
volition
man
possesses
both
it
is
evident
that
virtues
are
inherent
in
man
which
are
not
present
in
the
world
of
nature
this
is
provable
from
every
standpoint
if
it
be
claimed
that
the
intellectual
reality
of
man
belongs
to
the
world
of
naturethat
it
is
a
part
of
the
wholewe
ask
is
it
possible
for
the
part
to
contain
virtues
which
the
whole
does
not
possess
for
instance
is
it
possible
for
the
drop
to
contain
virtues
of
which
the
aggregate
body
of
the
sea
is
deprived
is
it
possible
for
a
leaf
to
be
imbued
with
virtues
which
are
lacking
in
the
whole
tree
is
it
possible
that
the
extraordinary
faculty
of
reason
in
man
is
animal
in
character
and
quality
on
the
other
hand
it
is
evident
and
true
though
most
astounding
that
in
man
there
is
present
this
supernatural
force
or
faculty
which
discovers
the
realities
of
things
and
which
possesses
the
power
of
idealization
or
intellection
it
is
capable
of
discovering
scientific
laws
and
science
we
know
is
not
a
tangible
reality
science
exists
in
the
mind
of
man
as
an
ideal
reality
the
mind
itself
reason
itself
is
an
ideal
reality
and
not
tangible
notwithstanding
this
some
of
the
sagacious
men
declare
we
have
attained
to
the
superlative
degree
of
knowledge
we
have
penetrated
the
laboratory
of
nature
studying
sciences
and
arts
we
have
attained
the
highest
station
of
knowledge
in
the
human
world
we
have
investigated
the
facts
as
they
are
and
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
nothing
is
rightly
acceptable
except
the
tangible
which
alone
is
a
reality
worthy
of
credence
all
that
is
not
tangible
is
imagination
and
nonsense
strange
indeed
that
after
twenty
years
training
in
colleges
and
universities
man
should
reach
such
a
station
wherein
he
will
deny
the
existence
of
the
ideal
or
that
which
is
not
perceptible
to
the
senses
have
you
ever
stopped
to
think
that
the
animal
already
has
graduated
from
such
a
university
have
you
ever
realized
that
the
cow
is
already
a
professor
emeritus
of
that
university
for
the
cow
without
hard
labor
and
study
is
already
a
philosopher
of
the
superlative
degree
in
the
school
of
nature
the
cow
denies
everything
that
is
not
tangible
saying
i
can
see
i
can
eat
therefore
i
believe
only
in
that
which
is
tangible
then
why
should
we
go
to
the
colleges

notes
by
bijou
straun
the
greatest
bestowal
of
god
in
the
world
of
humanity
is
religion
for
assuredly
the
divine
teachings
of
religion
are
above
all
other
sources
of
instruction
and
development
to
man
religion
confers
upon
man
eternal
life
and
guides
his
footsteps
in
the
world
of
morality
it
opens
the
doors
of
unending
happiness
and
bestows
everlasting
honor
upon
the
human
kingdom
it
has
been
the
basis
of
all
civilization
and
progress
in
the
history
of
mankind
we
will
therefore
investigate
religion
seeking
from
an
unprejudiced
standpoint
to
discover
whether
it
is
the
source
of
illumination
the
cause
of
development
and
the
animating
impulse
of
all
human
advancement
we
will
investigate
independently
free
from
the
restrictions
of
dogmatic
beliefs
blind
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
and
the
influence
of
mere
human
opinion
for
as
we
enter
this
question
we
will
find
some
who
declare
that
religion
is
a
cause
of
uplift
and
betterment
in
the
world
while
others
assert
just
as
positively
that
it
is
a
detriment
and
a
source
of
degradation
to
mankind
we
must
give
these
questions
thorough
and
impartial
consideration
so
that
no
doubt
or
uncertainty
may
linger
in
our
minds
regarding
them
how
shall
we
determine
whether
religion
has
been
the
cause
of
human
advancement
or
retrogression
we
will
first
consider
the
founders
of
the
religionsthe
prophetsreview
the
story
of
their
lives
compare
the
conditions
preceding
their
appearance
with
those
subsequent
to
their
departure
following
historical
records
and
irrefutable
facts
instead
of
relying
upon
traditionary
statements
which
are
open
to
both
acceptance
and
denial
among
the
great
prophets
was
abraham
who
being
an
iconoclast
and
a
herald
of
the
oneness
of
god
was
banished
from
his
native
land
he
founded
a
family
upon
which
the
blessing
of
god
descended
and
it
was
owing
to
this
religious
basis
and
ordination
that
the
abrahamic
house
progressed
and
advanced
through
the
divine
benediction
noteworthy
and
luminous
prophets
issued
from
his
lineage
there
appeared
isaac
ishmael
jacob
joseph
moses
aaron
david
and
solomon
the
holy
land
was
conquered
by
the
power
of
the
covenant
of
god
with
abraham
and
the
glory
of
the
solomonic
wisdom
and
sovereignty
dawned
all
this
was
due
to
the
religion
of
god
which
this
blessed
lineage
established
and
upheld
it
is
evident
that
throughout
the
history
of
abraham
and
his
posterity
this
was
the
source
of
their
honor
advancement
and
civilization
even
today
the
descendants
of
his
household
and
lineage
are
found
throughout
the
world
there
is
another
and
more
significant
aspect
to
this
religious
impulse
and
impetus
the
children
of
israel
were
in
bondage
and
captivity
in
the
land
of
egypt
four
hundred
years
they
were
in
an
extreme
state
of
degradation
and
slavery
under
the
tyranny
and
oppression
of
the
egyptians
while
they
were
in
the
condition
of
abject
poverty
in
the
lowest
degree
of
abasement
ignorance
and
servility
moses
suddenly
appeared
among
them
although
he
was
but
a
shepherd
such
majesty
grandeur
and
efficiency
became
manifest
in
him
through
the
power
of
religion
that
his
influence
continues
to
this
day
his
prophethood
was
established
throughout
the
land
and
the
law
of
his
word
became
the
foundation
of
the
laws
of
the
nations
this
unique
personage
single
and
alone
rescued
the
children
of
israel
from
bondage
through
the
power
of
religious
training
and
discipline
he
led
them
to
the
holy
land
and
founded
there
a
great
civilization
which
has
become
permanent
and
renowned
and
under
which
these
people
attained
the
highest
degree
of
honor
and
glory
he
freed
them
from
bondage
and
captivity
he
imbued
them
with
qualities
of
progressiveness
and
capability
they
proved
to
be
a
civilizing
people
with
instincts
toward
education
and
scholastic
attainment
their
philosophy
became
renowned
their
industries
were
celebrated
throughout
the
nations
in
all
lines
of
advancement
which
characterize
a
progressive
people
they
achieved
distinction
in
the
splendor
of
the
reign
of
solomon
their
sciences
and
arts
advanced
to
such
a
degree
that
even
the
greek
philosophers
journeyed
to
jerusalem
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
hebrew
sages
and
acquire
the
basis
of
israelitish
law
according
to
eastern
history
this
is
an
established
fact
even
socrates
visited
the
jewish
doctors
in
the
holy
land
consorting
with
them
and
discussing
the
principles
and
basis
of
their
religious
belief
after
his
return
to
greece
he
formulated
his
philosophical
teaching
of
divine
unity
and
advanced
his
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
spirit
beyond
the
dissolution
of
the
body
without
doubt
socrates
absorbed
these
verities
from
the
wise
men
of
the
jews
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
hippocrates
and
other
philosophers
of
the
greeks
likewise
visited
palestine
and
acquired
wisdom
from
the
jewish
prophets
studying
the
basis
of
ethics
and
morality
returning
to
their
country
with
contributions
which
have
made
greece
famous
when
a
movement
fundamentally
religious
makes
a
weak
nation
strong
changes
a
nondescript
tribal
people
into
a
mighty
and
powerful
civilization
rescues
them
from
captivity
and
elevates
them
to
sovereignty
transforms
their
ignorance
into
knowledge
and
endows
them
with
an
impetus
of
advancement
in
all
degrees
of
development
this
is
not
theory
but
historical
fact
it
becomes
evident
that
religion
is
the
cause
of
mans
attainment
to
honor
and
sublimity
but
when
we
speak
of
religion
we
mean
the
essential
foundation
or
reality
of
religion
not
the
dogmas
and
blind
imitations
which
have
gradually
encrusted
it
and
which
are
the
cause
of
the
decline
and
effacement
of
a
nation
these
are
inevitably
destructive
and
a
menace
and
hindrance
to
a
nations
lifeeven
as
it
is
recorded
in
the
torah
and
confirmed
in
history
that
when
the
jews
became
fettered
by
empty
forms
and
imitations
the
wrath
of
god
became
manifest
when
they
forsook
the
foundations
of
the
law
of
god
nebuchadnezzar
came
and
conquered
the
holy
land
he
killed
and
made
captive
the
people
of
israel
laid
waste
the
country
and
populous
cities
and
burned
the
villages
seventy
thousand
jews
were
carried
away
captive
to
babylon
he
destroyed
jerusalem
despoiled
the
great
temple
desecrated
the
holy
of
holies
and
burned
the
torah
the
heavenly
book
of
scriptures
therefore
we
learn
that
allegiance
to
the
essential
foundation
of
the
divine
religions
is
ever
the
cause
of
development
and
progress
whereas
the
abandonment
and
beclouding
of
that
essential
reality
through
blind
imitations
and
adherence
to
dogmatic
beliefs
are
the
causes
of
a
nations
debasement
and
degradation
after
their
conquest
by
the
babylonians
the
jews
were
successively
subjugated
by
the
greeks
and
romans
under
the
roman
general
titus
in
ad
the
holy
land
was
stripped
and
pillaged
jerusalem
razed
to
its
foundations
and
the
israelites
scattered
broadcast
throughout
the
world
so
complete
was
their
dispersion
that
they
have
continued
without
a
country
and
government
of
their
own
to
the
present
day
from
this
review
of
the
history
of
the
jewish
people
we
learn
that
the
foundation
of
the
religion
of
god
laid
by
moses
was
the
cause
of
their
eternal
honor
and
national
prestige
the
animating
impulse
of
their
advancement
and
racial
supremacy
and
the
source
of
that
excellence
which
will
always
command
the
respect
and
reverence
of
those
who
understand
their
peculiar
destiny
and
outcome
the
dogmas
and
blind
imitations
which
gradually
obscured
the
reality
of
the
religion
of
god
proved
to
be
israels
destructive
influences
causing
the
expulsion
of
these
chosen
people
from
the
holy
land
of
their
covenant
and
promise
what
then
is
the
mission
of
the
divine
prophets
their
mission
is
the
education
and
advancement
of
the
world
of
humanity
they
are
the
real
teachers
and
educators
the
universal
instructors
of
mankind
if
we
wish
to
discover
whether
any
one
of
these
great
souls
or
messengers
was
in
reality
a
prophet
of
god
we
must
investigate
the
facts
surrounding
his
life
and
history
and
the
first
point
of
our
investigation
will
be
the
education
he
bestowed
upon
mankind
if
he
has
been
an
educator
if
he
has
really
trained
a
nation
or
people
causing
it
to
rise
from
the
lowest
depths
of
ignorance
to
the
highest
station
of
knowledge
then
we
are
sure
that
he
was
a
prophet
this
is
a
plain
and
clear
method
of
procedure
proof
that
is
irrefutable
we
do
not
need
to
seek
after
other
proofs
we
do
not
need
to
mention
miracles
saying
that
out
of
rock
water
gushed
forth
for
such
miracles
and
statements
may
be
denied
and
refused
by
those
who
hear
them
the
deeds
of
moses
are
conclusive
evidences
of
his
prophethood
if
a
man
be
fair
unbiased
and
willing
to
investigate
reality
he
will
undoubtedly
testify
to
the
fact
that
moses
was
verily
a
man
of
god
and
a
great
personage
in
further
consideration
of
this
subject
i
wish
you
to
be
fair
and
reasonable
in
your
judgment
setting
aside
all
religious
prejudices
we
should
earnestly
seek
and
thoroughly
investigate
realities
recognizing
that
the
purpose
of
the
religion
of
god
is
the
education
of
humanity
and
the
unity
and
fellowship
of
mankind
furthermore
we
will
establish
the
point
that
the
foundations
of
the
religions
of
god
are
one
foundation
this
foundation
is
not
multiple
for
it
is
reality
itself
reality
does
not
admit
of
multiplicity
although
each
of
the
divine
religions
is
separable
into
two
divisions
one
concerns
the
world
of
morality
and
the
ethical
training
of
human
nature
it
is
directed
to
the
advancement
of
the
world
of
humanity
in
general
it
reveals
and
inculcates
the
knowledge
of
god
and
makes
possible
the
discovery
of
the
verities
of
life
this
is
ideal
and
spiritual
teaching
the
essential
quality
of
divine
religion
and
not
subject
to
change
or
transformation
it
is
the
one
foundation
of
all
the
religions
of
god
therefore
the
religions
are
essentially
one
and
the
same
the
second
classification
or
division
comprises
social
laws
and
regulations
applicable
to
human
conduct
this
is
not
the
essential
spiritual
quality
of
religion
it
is
subject
to
change
and
transformation
according
to
the
exigencies
and
requirements
of
time
and
place
for
instance
in
the
time
of
noah
certain
requirements
made
it
necessary
that
all
seafood
be
allowable
or
lawful
during
the
time
of
the
abrahamic
prophethood
it
was
considered
allowable
because
of
a
certain
exigency
that
a
man
should
marry
his
aunt
even
as
sarah
was
the
sister
of
abrahams
mother
during
the
cycle
of
adam
it
was
lawful
and
expedient
for
a
man
to
marry
his
own
sister
even
as
abel
cain
and
seth
the
sons
of
adam
married
their
sisters
but
in
the
law
of
the
pentateuch
revealed
by
moses
these
marriages
were
forbidden
and
their
custom
and
sanction
abrogated
other
laws
formerly
valid
were
annulled
during
the
time
of
moses
for
example
it
was
lawful
in
abrahams
cycle
to
eat
the
flesh
of
the
camel
but
during
the
time
of
jacob
this
was
prohibited
such
changes
and
transformations
in
the
teaching
of
religion
are
applicable
to
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
but
they
are
not
important
or
essential
moses
lived
in
the
wilderness
of
sinai
where
crime
necessitated
direct
punishment
there
were
no
penitentiaries
or
penalties
of
imprisonment
therefore
according
to
the
exigency
of
the
time
and
place
it
was
a
law
of
god
that
an
eye
should
be
given
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
it
would
not
be
practicable
to
enforce
this
law
at
the
present
timefor
instance
to
blind
a
man
who
accidentally
blinded
you
in
the
torah
there
are
many
commands
concerning
the
punishment
of
a
murderer
it
would
not
be
allowable
or
possible
to
carry
out
these
ordinances
today
human
conditions
and
exigencies
are
such
that
even
the
question
of
capital
punishmentthe
one
penalty
which
most
nations
have
continued
to
enforce
for
murderis
now
under
discussion
by
wise
men
who
are
debating
its
advisability
in
fact
laws
for
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
are
only
valid
temporarily
the
exigencies
of
the
time
of
moses
justified
cutting
off
a
mans
hand
for
theft
but
such
a
penalty
is
not
allowable
now
time
changes
conditions
and
laws
change
to
suit
conditions
we
must
remember
that
these
changing
laws
are
not
the
essentials
they
are
the
accidentals
of
religion
the
essential
ordinances
established
by
a
manifestation
of
god
are
spiritual
they
concern
moralities
the
ethical
development
of
man
and
faith
in
god
they
are
ideal
and
necessarily
permanentexpressions
of
the
one
foundation
and
not
amenable
to
change
or
transformation
therefore
the
fundamental
basis
of
the
revealed
religion
of
god
is
immutable
unchanging
throughout
the
centuries
not
subject
to
the
varying
conditions
of
the
human
world
christ
ratified
and
proclaimed
the
foundation
of
the
law
of
moses
muhammad
and
all
the
prophets
have
revoiced
that
same
foundation
of
reality
therefore
the
purposes
and
accomplishments
of
the
divine
messengers
have
been
one
and
the
same
they
were
the
source
of
advancement
to
the
body
politic
and
the
cause
of
the
honor
and
divine
civilization
of
humanity
the
foundation
of
which
is
one
and
the
same
in
every
dispensation
it
is
evident
then
that
the
proofs
of
the
validity
and
inspiration
of
a
prophet
of
god
are
the
deeds
of
beneficent
accomplishment
and
greatness
emanating
from
him
if
he
proves
to
be
instrumental
in
the
elevation
and
betterment
of
mankind
he
is
undoubtedly
a
valid
and
heavenly
messenger
i
wish
you
to
be
reasonable
and
just
in
your
consideration
of
the
following
statements
at
the
time
when
the
israelites
had
been
dispersed
by
the
power
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
national
life
of
the
hebrew
people
had
been
effaced
by
their
conquerorswhen
the
law
of
god
had
seemingly
passed
from
them
and
the
foundation
of
the
religion
of
god
was
apparently
destroyedjesus
christ
appeared
when
he
arose
among
the
jews
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
proclaim
the
validity
of
the
manifestation
of
moses
he
declared
that
the
torah
the
old
testament
was
the
book
of
god
and
that
all
the
prophets
of
israel
were
valid
and
true
he
extolled
the
mission
of
moses
and
through
his
proclamation
the
name
of
moses
was
spread
throughout
the
world
through
christianity
the
greatness
of
moses
became
known
among
all
nations
it
is
a
fact
that
before
the
appearance
of
christ
the
name
of
moses
had
not
been
heard
in
persia
in
india
they
had
no
knowledge
of
judaism
and
it
was
only
through
the
christianizing
of
europe
that
the
teachings
of
the
old
testament
became
spread
in
that
region
throughout
europe
there
was
not
a
copy
of
the
old
testament
but
consider
this
carefully
and
judge
it
aright
through
the
instrumentality
of
christ
through
the
translation
of
the
new
testament
the
little
volume
of
the
gospel
the
old
testament
the
torah
has
been
translated
into
six
hundred
languages
and
spread
everywhere
in
the
world
the
names
of
the
hebrew
prophets
became
household
words
among
the
nations
who
believed
that
the
children
of
israel
were
verily
the
chosen
people
of
god
a
holy
nation
under
the
especial
blessing
and
protection
of
god
and
that
therefore
the
prophets
who
had
arisen
in
israel
were
the
daysprings
of
revelation
and
brilliant
stars
in
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
god
therefore
christ
really
promulgated
judaism
for
he
was
a
jew
and
not
opposed
to
the
jews
he
did
not
deny
the
prophethood
of
moses
on
the
contrary
he
proclaimed
and
ratified
it
he
did
not
invalidate
the
torah
he
spread
its
teachings
that
portion
of
the
ordinances
of
moses
which
concerned
transactions
and
unimportant
conditions
underwent
transformation
but
the
essential
teachings
of
moses
were
revoiced
and
confirmed
by
christ
without
change
he
left
nothing
unfinished
or
incomplete
likewise
through
the
supreme
efficacy
and
power
of
the
word
of
god
he
united
most
of
the
nations
of
the
east
and
the
west
this
was
accomplished
at
a
time
when
these
nations
were
opposed
to
each
other
in
hostility
and
strife
he
led
them
beneath
the
overshadowing
tent
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
he
educated
them
until
they
became
united
and
agreed
and
through
his
spirit
of
conciliation
the
roman
greek
chaldean
and
egyptian
were
blended
in
a
composite
civilization
this
wonderful
power
and
extraordinary
efficacy
of
the
word
prove
conclusively
the
validity
of
christ
consider
how
his
heavenly
sovereignty
is
still
permanent
and
lasting
verily
this
is
conclusive
proof
and
manifest
evidence
from
another
horizon
we
see
muhammad
the
prophet
of
arabia
appearing
you
may
not
know
that
the
first
address
of
muhammad
to
his
tribe
was
the
statement
verily
moses
was
a
prophet
of
god
and
the
torah
is
a
book
of
god
verily
o
ye
people
ye
must
believe
in
the
torah
in
moses
and
the
prophets
ye
must
accept
all
the
prophets
of
israel
as
valid
in
the
quran
the
muslim
bible
there
are
seven
statements
or
repetitions
of
the
mosaic
narrative
and
in
all
the
historic
accounts
moses
is
praised
muhammad
announces
that
moses
was
the
greatest
prophet
of
god
that
god
guided
him
in
the
wilderness
of
sinai
that
through
the
light
of
guidance
moses
hearkened
to
the
summons
of
god
that
he
was
the
interlocutor
of
god
and
the
bearer
of
the
tablet
of
the
ten
commandments
that
all
the
contemporary
nations
of
the
world
arose
against
him
and
that
eventually
moses
conquered
them
for
falsehood
and
error
are
ever
overcome
by
truth
there
are
many
other
instances
of
muhammads
confirmation
of
moses
i
am
mentioning
but
a
few
consider
that
muhammad
was
born
among
the
savage
and
barbarous
tribes
of
arabia
lived
among
them
and
was
outwardly
illiterate
and
uninformed
of
the
holy
books
of
god
the
arabian
people
were
in
the
utmost
ignorance
and
barbarism
they
buried
their
infant
daughters
alive
considering
this
to
be
an
evidence
of
a
valorous
and
lofty
nature
they
lived
in
bondage
and
serfdom
under
the
persian
and
roman
governments
and
were
scattered
throughout
the
desert
engaged
in
continual
strife
and
bloodshed
when
the
light
of
muhammad
dawned
the
darkness
of
ignorance
was
dispelled
from
the
deserts
of
arabia
in
a
short
period
of
time
those
barbarous
peoples
attained
a
superlative
degree
of
civilization
which
with
baghdad
as
its
center
extended
as
far
westward
as
spain
and
afterward
influenced
the
greater
part
of
europe
what
proof
of
prophethood
could
be
greater
than
this
unless
we
close
our
eyes
to
justice
and
remain
obstinately
opposed
to
reason
today
the
christians
are
believers
in
moses
accept
him
as
a
prophet
of
god
and
praise
him
most
highly
the
muslims
are
likewise
believers
in
moses
accept
the
validity
of
his
prophethood
at
the
same
time
believing
in
christ
could
it
be
said
that
the
acceptance
of
moses
by
the
christians
and
muslims
has
been
harmful
and
detrimental
to
those
people
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
beneficial
to
them
proving
that
they
have
been
fairminded
and
just
what
harm
could
result
to
the
jewish
people
then
if
they
in
return
should
accept
christ
and
acknowledge
the
validity
of
the
prophethood
of
muhammad
by
this
acceptance
and
praiseworthy
attitude
the
enmity
and
hatred
which
have
afflicted
mankind
so
many
centuries
would
be
dispelled
fanaticism
and
bloodshed
pass
away
and
the
world
be
blessed
by
unity
and
agreement
christians
and
muslims
believe
and
admit
that
moses
was
the
interlocutor
of
god
why
do
you
not
say
that
christ
was
the
word
of
god
why
do
you
not
speak
these
few
words
that
will
do
away
with
all
this
difficulty
then
there
will
be
no
more
hatred
and
fanaticism
no
more
warfare
and
bloodshed
in
the
land
of
promise
then
there
will
be
peace
among
you
forever
verily
i
now
declare
to
you
that
moses
was
the
interlocutor
of
god
and
a
most
noteworthy
prophet
that
moses
revealed
the
fundamental
law
of
god
and
founded
the
real
ethical
basis
of
the
civilization
and
progress
of
humanity
what
harm
is
there
in
this
have
i
lost
anything
by
saying
this
to
you
and
believing
it
as
a
bahai
on
the
contrary
it
benefits
me
and
bahaullah
the
founder
of
the
bahai
movement
confirms
me
saying
you
have
been
fair
and
just
in
your
judgment
you
have
impartially
investigated
the
truth
and
arrived
at
a
true
conclusion
you
have
announced
your
belief
in
moses
a
prophet
of
god
and
accepted
the
torah
the
book
of
god
inasmuch
as
it
is
possible
for
me
to
sweep
away
all
evidences
of
prejudice
by
such
a
liberal
and
universal
statement
of
belief
why
is
it
not
possible
for
you
to
do
likewise
why
not
put
an
end
to
this
religious
strife
and
establish
a
bond
of
connection
between
the
hearts
of
men
why
should
not
the
followers
of
one
religion
praise
the
founder
or
teacher
of
another
the
other
religionists
extol
the
greatness
of
moses
and
admit
that
he
was
the
founder
of
judaism
why
do
the
hebrews
refuse
to
praise
and
accept
the
other
great
messengers
who
have
appeared
in
the
world
what
harm
could
there
be
in
this
what
rightful
objection
none
whatever
you
would
lose
nothing
by
such
action
and
statement
on
the
contrary
you
would
contribute
to
the
welfare
of
mankind
you
would
be
instrumental
in
establishing
the
happiness
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
eternal
honor
of
man
depends
upon
the
liberalism
of
this
modern
age
inasmuch
as
our
god
is
one
god
and
the
creator
of
all
mankind
he
provides
for
and
protects
all
we
acknowledge
him
as
a
god
of
kindness
justice
and
mercy
why
then
should
we
his
children
and
followers
war
and
fight
bringing
sorrow
and
grief
into
the
hearts
of
each
other
god
is
loving
and
merciful
his
intention
in
religion
has
ever
been
the
bond
of
unity
and
affinity
between
humankind
praise
be
to
god
the
medieval
ages
of
darkness
have
passed
away
and
this
century
of
radiance
has
dawned
this
century
wherein
the
reality
of
things
is
becoming
evident
wherein
science
is
penetrating
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
is
being
established
and
service
to
mankind
is
the
paramount
motive
of
all
existence
shall
we
remain
steeped
in
our
fanaticisms
and
cling
to
our
prejudices
is
it
fitting
that
we
should
still
be
bound
and
restricted
by
ancient
fables
and
superstitions
of
the
past
be
handicapped
by
superannuated
beliefs
and
the
ignorances
of
dark
ages
waging
religious
wars
fighting
and
shedding
blood
shunning
and
anathematizing
each
other
is
this
becoming
is
it
not
better
for
us
to
be
loving
and
considerate
toward
each
other
is
it
not
preferable
to
enjoy
fellowship
and
unity
join
in
anthems
of
praise
to
the
most
high
god
and
extol
all
his
prophets
in
the
spirit
of
acceptance
and
true
vision
then
indeed
this
world
will
become
a
paradise
and
the
promised
day
of
god
will
dawn
then
according
to
the
prophecy
of
isaiah
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
will
drink
from
the
same
stream
the
owl
and
the
vulture
will
nest
together
in
the
same
branches
and
the
lion
and
the
calf
pasture
in
the
same
meadow
what
does
this
mean
it
means
that
fierce
and
contending
religions
hostile
creeds
and
divergent
beliefs
will
reconcile
and
associate
notwithstanding
their
former
hatreds
and
antagonism
through
the
liberalism
of
human
attitude
demanded
in
this
radiant
century
they
will
blend
together
in
perfect
fellowship
and
love
this
is
the
spirit
and
meaning
of
isaiahs
words
there
will
never
be
a
day
when
this
prophecy
will
come
to
pass
literally
for
these
animals
by
their
natures
cannot
mingle
and
associate
in
kindness
and
love
therefore
this
prophecy
symbolizes
the
unity
and
agreement
of
races
nations
and
peoples
who
will
come
together
in
attitudes
of
intelligence
illumination
and
spirituality
the
age
has
dawned
when
human
fellowship
will
become
a
reality
the
century
has
come
when
all
religions
shall
be
unified
the
dispensation
is
at
hand
when
all
nations
shall
enjoy
the
blessings
of
international
peace
the
cycle
has
arrived
when
racial
prejudice
will
be
abandoned
by
tribes
and
peoples
of
the
world
the
epoch
has
begun
wherein
all
native
lands
will
be
conjoined
in
one
great
human
family
for
all
mankind
shall
dwell
in
peace
and
security
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
great
tabernacle
of
the
one

when
christ
appeared
certain
blessed
souls
followed
his
example
they
were
with
their
master
ever
watching
and
observing
his
conduct
movements
and
thoughts
they
witnessed
the
persecutions
which
were
heaped
upon
him
and
were
informed
of
all
the
events
appertaining
to
that
marvelous
liferecipients
of
his
kindness
and
favors
after
the
ascension
of
christ
they
hastened
to
various
regions
of
the
world
scattering
broadcast
the
teachings
and
instructions
which
he
had
given
them
through
their
devotion
and
efforts
other
places
and
remote
nations
became
informed
of
the
principles
revealed
by
him
through
their
instrumentality
the
east
was
illumined
and
the
light
which
flooded
the
east
flooded
the
west
this
light
was
the
cause
of
guiding
great
hosts
of
people
it
proved
to
be
a
preventive
of
warfare
in
many
instances
this
is
evidenced
in
the
unification
and
conjoining
of
various
nations
which
had
formerly
been
hostile
to
each
othersuch
as
the
greeks
romans
egyptians
syrians
chaldeans
and
assyrians
through
christ
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
received
its
expression
and
proved
to
be
the
cause
of
spiritual
illumination
for
mankind
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
became
effective
in
the
hearts
of
people
now
we
have
likewise
come
from
the
orient
announcing
the
appearance
of
bahaullah
who
shone
from
the
horizon
of
the
east
we
have
observed
his
life
and
beheld
his
deeds
we
have
been
witnesses
of
his
ordeals
and
sufferings
observers
of
his
imprisonment
and
exile
we
are
fully
acquainted
with
the
persecutions
heaped
upon
his
blessed
personality
therefore
we
who
are
his
disciples
have
been
scattered
throughout
the
world
in
order
that
his
teachings
may
be
widespread
and
be
heard
by
every
ear
thus
may
the
people
receive

of
the
dawn
of
his
great
dispensation
become
aware
of
the
divine
evidences
manifest
in
him
be
informed
of
the
wonderful
episodes
of
his
marvelous
life
the
greatness
of
his
power
in
withstanding
the
kings
of
the
orient
the
might
of
his
spirit
in
upholding
under
all
circumstances
the
standard
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
mankind
perchance
you
have
heard
or
read
of
him
i
will
give
you
a
brief
epitome
of
his
life
in
order
that
you
may
be
informed
of
the
history
of
his
great
movement
and
know
his
teachings
bahaullah
was
a
persian
personage
descended
from
prominent
lineage
during
his
early
years
a
youth
whose
name
was
alimuhammad
appeared
in
persia
he
was
entitled
the
bab
which
means
door
or
gate
the
bearer
of
this
title
was
a
great
soul
from
whom
spiritual
signs
and
evidences
became
manifest
he
withstood
the
tests
of
time
and
lived
contrary
to
the
custom
and
usages
of
persia
he
revealed
a
new
system
of
faith
opposed
to
the
beliefs
in
his
country
and
promulgated
certain
principles
contrary
to
the
thoughts
of
the
people
for
this
that
remarkable
personality
was
imprisoned
by
the
persian
government
eventually
by
order
of
the
government
he
was
martyred
the
account
of
this
martyrdom
briefly
stated
is
as
follows
he
was
suspended
in
a
square
as
a
target
and
shot
to
death
this
revered
personage
foreshadowed
the
advent
of
another
soul
of
whom
he
said
when
he
cometh
he
shall
reveal
greater
things
unto
you
thus
after
the
martyrdom
of
the
bab
bahaullah
appeared
the
government
arose
against
him
the
priesthood
in
persia
opposed
him
subjecting
him
to
severe
persecution
his
possessions
were
confiscated
his
relatives
and
friends
were
killed
and
he
was
placed
in
a
dungeon
for
a
long
period
he
was
imprisoned
chained
and
subjected
to
severest
suffering
afterward
he
was
exiled
to
iraq
or
mesopotamia
from
thence
to
constantinople
then
transferred
to
adrianople
and
finally
to
akka
in
syria
he
spent
twentyfour
years
in
the
prison
of
akka
where
he
underwent
the
severest
ordeals
and
privations
without
a
day
or
night
of
relaxation
and
repose
notwithstanding
this
imprisonment
and
suffering
he
manifested
utmost
spiritual
power
and
majesty
although
imprisoned
he
withstood
two
tyrant
kings
and
eventually
overcame
both
shortly
after
his
imprisonment
he
addressed
epistles
or
tablets
to
all
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
world
summoning
them
to
universal
peace
to
unity
and
international
brotherhood
among
these
sovereigns
was
the
shah
of
persia
through
whose
instrumentality
chiefly
he
had
been
imprisoned
in
his
letter
to
that
ruler
he
arraigned
him
severely
and
prophesied
his
downfall
saying
thou
art
a
tyrant
thy
country
will
be
laid
waste
and
thy
family
humiliated
and
debased
he
wrote
to
the
sultan
of
turkey
in
similar
terms
saying
thy
dominion
will
pass
away
from
thee
the
epistles
to
the
kings
and
rulers
summoning
them
to
international
peace
were
written
by
bahaullah
fifty
years
ago
everything
he
wrote
has
come
to
pass
these
letters
were
published
in
bombay
thirty
years
ago
and
are
now
spread
broadcast
throughout
the
world
briefly
bahaullah
endured
forty
years
of
vicissitudes
ordeals
and
hardships
for
the
purpose
of
spreading
his
teachings
which
may
be
mentioned
as
follows
the
first
teaching
is
that
man
should
investigate
reality
for
reality
is
contrary
to
dogmatic
interpretations
and
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
of
belief
to
which
all
nations
and
peoples
adhere
so
tenaciously
these
blind
imitations
are
contrary
to
the
fundamental
basis
of
the
divine
religions
for
the
divine
religions
in
their
central
and
essential
teaching
are
based
upon
unity
love
and
peace
whereas
these
variations
and
imitations
have
ever
been
productive
of
warfare
sedition
and
strife
therefore
all
souls
should
consider
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
investigate
reality
reality
is
one
and
when
found
it
will
unify
all
mankind
reality
is
the
love
of
god
reality
is
the
knowledge
of
god
reality
is
justice
reality
is
the
oneness
or
solidarity
of
mankind
reality
is
international
peace
reality
is
the
knowledge
of
verities
reality
unifies
humanity
in
brief
his
theme
was
that
reality
underlies
all
the
great
religious
systems
of
the
world
he
summoned
the
nations
and
peoples
of
the
world
to
it
hostile
nations
because
of
their
acceptance
of
the
reality
of
his
words
became
unified
strife
discord
and
contention
among
them
passed
away
they
attained
a
station
of
utmost
love
at
present
in
asia
those
who
have
accepted
his
teachings
and
followed
his
example
although
formerly
most
hostile
and
bitter
toward
each
other
now
associate
in
brotherhood
and
fellowship
the
strife
and
warfare
of
past
times
have
ceased
among
them
jews
zoroastrians
christians
muslims
and
others
have
attained
to
a
superlative
state
of
love
and
agreement
through
bahaullah
they
now
consort
together
as
one
family
they
have
investigated
reality
reality
does
not
accept
multiplicity
nor
is
it
subject
to
divisibility
these
irreconcilable
peoples
have
become
unified
and
agreed
the
second
teaching
of
bahaullah
is
the
principle
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
god
is
one
his
servants
are
likewise
one
god
has
created
all
he
is
kind
to
all
inasmuch
as
he
is
such
a
tender
father
to
all
why
should
his
children
disagree
why
should
they
war
and
fight
like
the
heavenly
father
we
must
live
in
love
and
unity
man
is
the
temple
of
god
the
image
and
likeness
of
the
lord
surely
if
one
should
destroy
the
temple
of
god
he
will
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
creator
for
this
reason
we
must
live
together
in
amity
and
love
bahaullah
has
addressed
the
world
of
humanity
saying
verily
ye
are
the
fruits
of
one
tree
and
the
leaves
of
one
branch
this
signifies
that
the
entire
world
of
humanity
is
one
tree
the
various
nations
and
peoples
are
the
branches
of
that
tree
individual
members
of
mankind
are
represented
by
the
twigs
and
blossoms
why
should
these
parts
of
the
same
tree
manifest
strife
and
discord
toward
each
other
the
third
teaching
of
bahaullah
concerns
universal
peace
among
the
nations
among
the
religions
among
the
races
and
native
lands
he
has
declared
that
so
long
as
prejudicewhether
religious
racial
patriotic
political
or
sectariancontinues
to
exist
among
mankind
universal
peace
cannot
become
a
reality
in
the
world
from
the
earliest
history
of
man
down
to
the
present
time
all
the
wars
and
bloodshed
which
have
taken
place
were
caused
either
by
religious
racial
political
or
sectarian
bias
therefore
it
is
evident
that
so
long
as
these
prejudices
continue
the
world
of
humanity
cannot
attain
peace
and
composure
among
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
is
his
declaration
that
religion
must
be
the
cause
of
love
and
fellowship
must
be
the
source
of
unity
in
the
hearts
of
men
if
religion
becomes
a
cause
of
enmity
and
hatred
it
is
evident
that
the
abolition
of
religion
is
preferable
to
its
promulgation
for
religion
is
a
remedy
for
human
ills
if
a
remedy
should
be
productive
of
disease
it
is
certainly
advisable
to
abandon
it
furthermore
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
announce
that
religion
must
be
in
conformity
with
science
and
reason
otherwise
it
is
superstition
for
science
and
reason
are
realities
and
religion
itself
is
the
divine
reality
unto
which
true
science
and
reason
must
conform
god
has
bestowed
the
gift
of
mind
upon
man
in
order
that
he
may
weigh
every
fact
or
truth
presented
to
him
and
adjudge
whether
it
be
reasonable
that
which
conforms
to
his
reason
he
may
accept
as
true
while
that
which
reason
and
science
cannot
sanction
may
be
discarded
as
imagination
and
superstition
as
a
phantom
and
not
reality
inasmuch
as
the
blind
imitations
or
dogmatic
interpretations
current
among
men
do
not
coincide
with
the
postulates
of
reason
and
the
mind
and
scientific
investigation
cannot
acquiesce
thereto
many
souls
in
the
human
world
today
shun
and
deny
religion
that
is
to
say
imitations
when
weighed
in
the
scales
of
reason
will
not
conform
to
its
standard
and
requirement
therefore
these
souls
deny
religion
and
become
irreligious
whereas
if
the
reality
of
the
divine
religions
becomes
manifest
to
them
and
the
foundation
of
the
heavenly
teachings
is
revealed
coinciding
with
facts
and
evident
truths
reconciling
with
scientific
knowledge
and
reasonable
proof
all
may
acknowledge
them
and
irreligion
will
cease
to
exist
in
this
way
all
mankind
may
be
brought
to
the
foundation
of
religion
for
reality
is
true
reason
and
science
while
all
that
is
not
conformable
thereto
is
mere
superstition
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
also
proclaim
equality
between
man
and
woman
for
he
has
declared
that
all
are
the
servants
of
god
and
endowed
with
capacity
for
the
attainment
of
virtues
and
bestowals
all
are
the
manifestations
of
the
mercy
of
the
lord
in
the
creation
of
god
no
distinction
obtains
all
are
his
servants
in
the
estimation
of
god
there
is
no
gender
the
one
whose
deeds
are
more
worthy
whose
sayings
are
better
whose
accomplishments
are
more
useful
is
nearest
and
dearest
in
the
estimation
of
god
be
that
one
male
or
female
when
we
look
upon
creation
we
find
the
male
and
female
principle
apparent
in
all
phenomena
of
existence
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
we
find
the
male
and
female
fig
tree
the
male
and
female
palm
the
mulberry
tree
and
so
on
all
plant
life
is
characterized
by
this
difference
in
gender
but
no
distinction
or
preference
is
evidenced
nay
rather
there
is
perfect
equality
likewise
in
the
animal
kingdom
gender
obtains
we
have
male
and
female
but
no
distinction
or
preference
perfect
equality
is
manifest
the
animal
bereft
of
the
degree
of
human
reason
and
comprehension
is
unable
to
appreciate
the
questions
of
suffrage
nor
does
it
assert
its
prerogative
man
endowed
with
his
higher
reason
accomplished
in
attainments
and
comprehending
the
realities
of
things
will
surely
not
be
willing
to
allow
a
great
part
of
humanity
to
remain
defective
or
deprived
this
would
be
the
utmost
injustice
the
world
of
humanity
is
possessed
of
two
wings
the
male
and
the
female
so
long
as
these
two
wings
are
not
equivalent
in
strength
the
bird
will
not
fly
until
womankind
reaches
the
same
degree
as
man
until
she
enjoys
the
same
arena
of
activity
extraordinary
attainment
for
humanity
will
not
be
realized
humanity
cannot
wing
its
way
to
heights
of
real
attainment
when
the
two
wings
or
parts
become
equivalent
in
strength
enjoying
the
same
prerogatives
the
flight
of
man
will
be
exceedingly
lofty
and
extraordinary
therefore
woman
must
receive
the
same
education
as
man
and
all
inequality
be
adjusted
thus
imbued
with
the
same
virtues
as
man
rising
through
all
the
degrees
of
human
attainment
women
will
become
the
peers
of
men
and
until
this
equality
is
established
true
progress
and
attainment
for
the
human
race
will
not
be
facilitated
the
evident
reasons
underlying
this
are
as
follows
woman
by
nature
is
opposed
to
war
she
is
an
advocate
of
peace
children
are
reared
and
brought
up
by
the
mothers
who
give
them
the
first
principles
of
education
and
labor
assiduously
in
their
behalf
consider
for
instance
a
mother
who
has
tenderly
reared
a
son
for
twenty
years
to
the
age
of
maturity
surely
she
will
not
consent
to
having
that
son
torn
asunder
and
killed
in
the
field
of
battle
therefore
as
woman
advances
toward
the
degree
of
man
in
power
and
privilege
with
the
right
of
vote
and
control
in
human
government
most
assuredly
war
will
cease
for
woman
is
naturally
the
most
devoted
and
staunch
advocate
of
international
peace
bahaullah
teaches
that
material
civilization
is
incomplete
insufficient
and
that
divine
civilization
must
be
established
material
civilization
concerns
the
world
of
matter
or
bodies
but
divine
civilization
is
the
realm
of
ethics
and
moralities
until
the
moral
degree
of
the
nations
is
advanced
and
human
virtues
attain
a
lofty
level
happiness
for
mankind
is
impossible
the
philosophers
have
founded
material
civilization
the
prophets
have
founded
divine
civilization
christ
was
the
founder
of
heavenly
civilization
mankind
receives
the
bounties
of
material
civilization
as
well
as
divine
civilization
from
the
heavenly
prophets
the
capacity
for
achieving
extraordinary
and
praiseworthy
progress
is
bestowed
by
them
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
heavenly
civilization
is
not
possible
of
attainment
or
accomplishment
otherwise
this
evidences
the
need
of
humanity
for
heavenly
bestowals
and
until
these
heavenly
bestowals
are
received
eternal
happiness
cannot
be
realized
in
brief
the
purport
is
this
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
are
boundless
innumerable
time
will
not
allow
us
to
mention
them
in
detail
the
foundation
of
progress
and
real
prosperity
in
the
human
world
is
reality
for
reality
is
the
divine
standard
and
the
bestowal
of
god
reality
is
reasonableness
and
reasonableness
is
ever
conducive
to
the
honorable
station
of
man
reality
is
the
guidance
of
god
reality
is
the
cause
of
illumination
of
mankind
reality
is
love
ever
working
for
the
welfare
of
humanity
reality
is
the
bond
which
conjoins
hearts
this
ever
uplifts
man
toward
higher
stages
of
progress
and
attainment
reality
is
the
unity
of
mankind
conferring
everlasting
life
reality
is
perfect
equality
the
foundation
of
agreement
between
the
nations
the
first
step
toward
international
peace

i
have

and

no
other
capitol
has
such
beautiful
surroundings
just
as
it
is
imposing
and
distinguished
above

so
may
the
people
of
california
become
the
most
exalted
and
perfect

of
the
world
california
is
indeed
a
blessed
country
the
climate
is
temperate
the
sun
ever
shining
the
fruits
abundant
and
delicious
all
outer
blessings
are
evident
here
the
californians
are
a
noble
people
therefore
i
hope
they
may
make
extraordinary
progress
and
become
renowned
for
their
virtues
the
issue
of
paramount
importance
in
the
world
today
is
international
peace
the
european
continent
is
like
an
arsenal
a
storehouse
of
explosives
ready
for
ignition
and
one
spark
will
set
the
whole
of
europe
aflame
particularly
at
this
time
when
the
balkan
question
is
before
the
world
even
now
war
is
raging
furiously
in
some
places
the
blood
of
innocent
people
is
being
shed
children
are
made
captive
women
are
left
without
support
and
homes
are
being
destroyed
therefore
the
greatest
need
in
the
world
today
is
international
peace
the
time
is
ripe
it
is
time
for
the
abolition
of
warfare
the
unification
of
nations
and
governments
it
is
the
time
for
love
it
is
time
for
cementing
together
the
east
and
the
west
inasmuch
as
the
californians
seem
peace
loving
and
possessed
of
great
worthiness
and
capacity
i
hope
that
advocates
of
peace
may
daily
increase
among
them
until
the
whole
population
shall
stand
for
that
beneficent
outcome
may
the
men
of
affairs
in
this
democracy
uphold
the
standard
of
international
conciliation
then
may
altruistic
aims
and
thoughts
radiate
from
this
center
toward
all
other
regions
of
the
earth
and
may
the
glory
of
this
accomplishment
forever
halo
the
history
of
this
country
may
the
first
flag
of
international
peace
be
upraised
in
this
state
may
the
first
illumination
of
reality
shine
gloriously
upon
this
soil
may
this
center
and
capital
become
distinguished
in
all
degrees
of
accomplishment
for
the
virtues
of
humanity
and
the
possibilities
of
human
advancement
are
boundless
there
is
no
end
to
them
and
whatever
be
the
degree
to
which
humanity
may
attain
there
are
always
degrees
beyond
there
is
no
attainment
in
the
contingent
realm
of
which
it
may
be
said
beyond
this
state
of
being
and
perfection
there
is
no
other
or
this
has
achieved
the
superlative
degree
no
matter
how
perfect
it
may
appear
there
is
always
a
greater
degree
of
attainment
to
be
reached
therefore
no
matter
how
much
humanity
may
advance
there
are
ever
higher
stations
to
be
attained
because
virtues
are
unlimited
there
is
a
consummation
for
everything
except
virtues
and
although
this
country
has
achieved
extraordinary
progress
i
hope
that
its
attainment
may
be
immeasurably
greater
for
the
divine
bounties
are
infinite
and
unlimited
there
are
some
who
believe
that
the
divine
bounties
are
subject
to
cessation
for
example
they
think
that
the
revelation
of
god
the
effulgence
of
god
and
the
bounties
of
god
have
ended
this
is
selfevidently
a
mistaken
idea
for
none
of
these
is
subject
to
termination
the
reality
of
divinity
is
like
unto
the
sun
and
revelation
is
like
unto
the
rays
thereof
if
we
should
assert
that
the
bounties
of
god
are
not
everlasting
we
are
forced
to
believe
that
divinity
can
come
to
an
end
whereas
the
reality
of
divinity
enfolds
all
virtues
and
by
reason
of
these
bounties
is
perfect
were
it
not
possessed
of
all
these
perfections
or
virtues
it
could
not
be
divinity
the
sun
is
the
sun
because
of
its
rays
light
and
heat
if
it
could
be
dispossessed
of
them
it
would
not
be
the
sun
therefore
if
we
say
that
the
divinity
or
sovereignty
of
god
is
accidental
and
subject
to
termination
we
must
perforce
think
that
divinity
itself
is
accidental
without
foundation
and
not
essential
god
is
the
creator
the
word
creator
presupposes
or
connotes
creation
god
is
the
provider
the
word
provider
implies
recipients
of
provision
another
name
for
the
creator
is
the
resuscitator
which
demands
the
existence
of
creatures
to
be
resuscitated
if
he
be
not
the
provider
how
could
we
conceive
of
creatures
to
receive
his
bounty
if
he
be
not
the
lord
how
could
we
conceive
of
subjects
if
he
be
not
the
knower
how
could
we
conceive
of
those
known
if
we
should
say
that
there
was
a
time
in
past
ages
when
god
was
not
possessed
of
his
creation
or
that
there
was
a
beginning
for
the
world
it
would
be
a
denial
of
creation
and
the
creator
or
if
we
should
declare
that
a
time
may
come
when
there
will
be
a
cessation
of
divine
bounties
we
should
virtually
deny
the
existence
of
divinity
it
is
as
though
man
should
conceive
of
a
king
without
country
army
treasury
and
all
that
constitutes
sovereignty
or
kingdom
is
it
possible
to
conceive
of
such
a
sovereign
a
king
must
be
possessed
of
a
dominion
an
army
and
all
that
appertains
to
sovereignty
in
order
that
his
sovereignty
may
be
a
reality
it
is
even
so
with
the
reality
of
divinity
which
enfolds
all
virtues
the
sovereignty
thereof
is
everlasting
and
the
creation
thereof
is
without
beginning
and
without
end
among
the
bounties
of
god
is
revelation
hence
revelation
is
progressive
and
continuous
it
never
ceases
it
is
necessary
that
the
reality
of
divinity
with
all
its
perfections
and
attributes
should
become
resplendent
in
the
human
world
the
reality
of
divinity
is
like
an
endless
ocean
revelation
may
be
likened
to
the
rain
can
you
imagine
the
cessation
of
rain
ever
on
the
face
of
the
earth
somewhere
rain
is
pouring
down
briefly
the
world
of
existence
is
progressive
it
is
subject
to
development
and
growth
consider
how
great
has
been
the
progress
in
this
radiant
century
civilization
has
unfolded
nations
have
developed
industrialism
and
jurisprudence
have
expanded
sciences
inventions
and
discoveries
have
increased
all
of
these
show
that
the
world
of
existence
is
continuously
progressing
and
developing
and
therefore
assuredly
the
virtues
characterizing
the
maturity
of
man
must
likewise
expand
and
grow
the
greatest
bestowal
of
god
to
man
is
the
capacity
to
attain
human
virtues
therefore
the
teachings
of
religion
must
be
reformed
and
renewed
because
past
teachings
are
not
suitable
for
the
present
time
for
example
the
sciences
of
bygone
centuries
are
not
adequate
for
the
present
because
sciences
have
undergone
reform
the
industrialism
of
the
past
will
not
ensure
present
efficiency
because
industrialism
has
advanced
the
laws
of
the
past
are
being
superseded
because
they
are
not
applicable
to
this
time
all
material
conditions
pertaining
to
the
world
of
humanity
have
undergone
reform
have
achieved
development
and
the
institutes
of
the
past
are
not
to
be
compared
with
those
of
this
age
the
laws
and
institutes
of
former
governments
cannot
be
current
today
for
legislation
must
be
in
conformity
with
the
needs
and
requirements
of
the
body
politic
at
this
time
this
has
been
the
case
also
with
the
religious
teachings
so
long
set
forth
in
the
temples
and
churches
because
they
were
not
based
upon
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
religions
of
god
in
other
words
the
foundation
of
the
divine
religions
had
become
obscured
and
nonessentials
of
form
and
ceremony
were
adhered
tothat
is
the
kernel
of
religion
had
apparently
disappeared
and
only
the
shell
remained
consequently
it
was
necessary
that
the
fundamental
basis
of
all
religious
teaching
should
be
restored
that
the
sun
of
reality
which
had
set
should
rise
again
that
the
springtime
which
had
refreshed
the
arena
of
life
in
ages
gone
by
should
appear
anew
that
the
rain
which
had
ceased
should
descend
that
the
breezes
which
had
become
stilled
should
blow
once
more
therefore
bahaullah
appeared
from
the
horizon
of
the
orient
and
reestablished
the
essential
foundation
of
the
religious
teachings
of
the
world
the
wornout
traditional
beliefs
current
among
men
were
removed
he
caused
fellowship
and
agreement
to
exist
between
the
representatives
of
varying
denominations
so
that
love
became
manifest
among
the
contending
religions
he
created
a
condition
of
harmony
among
hostile
sects
and
upheld
the
banner
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
he
established
the
foundation
for
international
peace
caused
the
hearts
of
nations
to
be
cemented
together
and
conferred
new
life
upon
the
various
peoples
of
the
east
among
those
who
have
followed
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
no
one
says
i
am
a
persian
i
am
a
turk
i
am
a
frenchman
or
i
am
an
englishman
no
one
says
i
am
a
muslim
upholding
the
only
true
religion
i
am
a
christian
loyal
to
my
traditional
and
inherited
beliefs
i
am
a
jew
following
talmudic
interpretations
or
i
am
a
zoroastrian
and
opposed
to
all
other
religions
on
the
contrary
all
have
been
rescued
from
religious
racial
political
and
patriotic
prejudices
and
are
now
associating
in
fellowship
and
love
to
the
extent
that
if
you
should
attend
one
of
their
meetings
you
would
be
unable
to
observe
any
distinction
between
christian
and
muslim
jew
and
zoroastrian
persian
and
turk
arab
and
european
for
their
meetings
are
based
upon
the
essential
foundations
of
religion
and
real
unity
has
been
established
among
them
former
antagonisms
have
passed
away
the
centuries
of
sectarian
hatred
are
ended
the
period
of
aversion
has
gone
by
the
medieval
conditions
of
ignorance
have
ceased
to
exist
verily
the
century
of
radiance
has
dawned
minds
are
advancing
perceptions
are
broadening
realizations
of
human
possibilities
are
becoming
universal
susceptibilities
are
developing
the
discovery
of
realities
is
progressing
therefore
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
cast
aside
all
the
prejudices
of
ignorance
discard
superannuated
beliefs
in
traditions
of
past
ages
and
raise
aloft
the
banner
of
international
agreement
let
us
cooperate
in
love
and
through
spiritual
reciprocity
enjoy
eternal
happiness
and
peace

notes
by
gertrude
buikema
in
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
great
interest
was
manifested
in
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
by
the
newspapers
universities
and
churches
our
addresses
were
lengthy
the
message
of
the
cause
was
proclaimed
and
arguments
and
evidences
advanced
there
was
no
dissent
all
heard
the
glad
tidings
with
complete
acquiescence
and
praise
was
unanimous
even
including
the
ministers
the
friends
in
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
are
very
firm
in
the
covenant
if
they
sense
the
least
violation
on
the
part
of
anyone
they
shun
him
entirely
for
they
know
that
such
a
person
is
engaged
in
extinguishing
the
lamps
of
faith
ignited
by
the
light
of
the
covenant
thereby
producing
weakness
and
indifference
in
the
divine
cause
for
instance
the
firm
ones
teach
a
person
then
the
violators
go
to
him
and
instill
suspicion
until
he
becomes
lukewarm
there
have
been
violators
here
in
chicago
for
twenty
years
what
have
they
done
nothing
have
they
been
able
to
teach
anybody
have
they
been
able
to
speak
in
churches
or
address
audiences
elsewhere
have
they
been
able
to
make
anybody
firm
in
the
cause
they
are
doing
nothing
except
extinguishing
the
lamps
we
ignite
the
friends
in
san
francisco
are
exceedingly
firm
they
do
not
receive
violators
in
their
homes
recently
a
violator
went
to
that
city
the
bahai
friends
turned
him
away
saying
you
are
not
with
us
why
do
you
try
to
come
among
us
today
the
most
important
principle
of
faith
is
firmness
in
the
covenant
because
firmness
in
the
covenant
wards
off
differences
therefore
you
must
be
firm
as
mountains
after
the
departure
of
christ
many
appeared
who
were
instrumental
in
creating
factions
schisms
and
discussions
it
became
difficult
to
know
which
one
was
following
the
right
path
one
of
these
disturbers
was
nestorius
a
syrian
who
proclaimed
that
christ
was
not
a
prophet
of
god
this
created
a
division
and
sect
called
the
nestorians
the
catholics
declared
jesus
christ
to
be
the
son
of
god
even
pronouncing
him
to
be
deity
itself
the
protestants
announced
the
doctrine
that
christ
embodied
two
elements
the
human
and
the
divine
in
brief
divisions
were
created
in
the
religion
of
god
and
it
was
not
known
which
was
pursuing
the
right
pathway
because
there
was
no
appointed
center
to
whom
christ
referred
everyone
no
successor
whose
word
was
a
gateway
to
the
truth
if
christ
had
revealed
a
covenant
with
some
soul
commanding
all
to
cling
to
his
word
and
interpretation
as
correct
it
would
have
been
evident
which
belief
and
statement
was
valid
and
true
inasmuch
as
there
was
no
appointed
explainer
of
the
book
of
christ
everyone
made
the
claim
to
authority
saying
this
is
the
true
pathway
and
others
are
not
to
ward
off
such
dissensions
as
these
and
prevent
any
person
from
creating
a
division
or
sect
the
blessed
perfection
bahaullah
appointed
a
central
authoritative
personage
declaring
him
to
be
the
expounder
of
the
book
this
implies
that
the
people
in
general
do
not
understand
the
meanings
of
the
book
but
this
appointed
one
does
understand
therefore
bahaullah
said
he
is
the
explainer
of
my
book
and
the
center
of
my
testament
in
the
last
verses
of
the
book
instructions
are
revealed
declaring
that
after
me
you
must
turn
toward
a
special
personage
and
whatsoever
he
says
is
correct
in
the
book
of
the
covenant
bahaullah
declares
that
by
these
two
verses
this
personage
is
meant
in
all
his
books
and
tablets
he
has
praised
those
who
are
firm
in
the
covenant
and
rebuked
those
who
are
not
he
said
verily
shun
those
who
are
shaken
in
the
covenant
verily
god
is
the
confirmer
of
the
firm
ones
in
his
prayers
he
has
said
o
god
render
those
who
are
firm
in
the
covenant
blessed
and
degrade
those
who
are
not
o
god
be
the
protector
of
him
who
protecteth
him
and
confirm
him
who
confirms
the
center
of
the
covenant
many
utterances
are
directed
against
the
violators
of
the
covenant
the
purpose
being
that
no
dissension
should
arise
in
the
blessed
cause
that
no
one
should
say
my
opinion
is
this
and
that
all
may
know
who
is
the
authoritative
expounder
and
whatsoever
he
says
is
correct
bahaullah
has
not
left
any
possible
room
for
dissension
naturally
there
are
some
who
are
antagonistic
some
who
are
followers
of
selfdesire
others
who
hold
to
their
own
ideas
and
still
others
who
wish
to
create
dissension
in
the
cause
for
example
judas
iscariot
was
one
of
the
disciples
yet
he
betrayed
christ
such
a
thing
has
happened
in
the
past
but
in
this
day
the
blessed
perfection
has
declared
this
person
is
the
expounder
of
my
book
and
all
must
turn
to
him
the
purpose
is
to
ward
off
dissension
and
differences
among
his
followers
notwithstanding
this
safeguard
and
provision
against
disagreement
there
are
certain
souls
here
in
america
and
a
few
in
akka
who
have
violated
this
explicit
command
for
twenty
years
these
violators
have
accomplished
nothing
have
they
accomplished
anything
in
chicago
the
friends
here
must
be
like
the
friends
in
san
francisco
whenever
they
sense
the
least
violation
from
anyone
they
should
say
begone
you
shall
not
associate
with
us

notes
by
gertrude
buikema
i
am
well
pleased
with
every
person
here
this
evening
and
most
happy
in
meeting
the
friends
of
god
and
maidservants
of
the
merciful
praise
be
to
god
the
faces
are
radiant
and
the
hearts
are
attracted
to
the
kingdom
of
abha
faith
is
evident
in
the
countenances
of
all
and
this
is
a
source
of
joy
the
blessed
perfection
bahaullah
endured
hardships
and
vicissitudes
nearly
fifty
years
there
was
no
ordeal
or
difficulty
he
did
not
experience
yet
he
endured
all
in
perfect
joy
and
happiness
those
who
beheld
him
were
assured
of
his
great
happiness
for
no
trace
of
sadness
or
sorrow
was
ever
visible
upon
his
face
even
in
prison
he
was
like
a
king
enthroned
in
majesty
and
greatness
and
he
ever
bore
himself
with
supreme
confidence
and
dignity
when
the
officers
and
grandees
of
the
government
were
presented
to
him
they
became
respectful
at
once
his
majesty
and
dignity
were
aweinspiring
remember
he
was
a
prisonerhe
was
in
prison
he
endured
ordeals
and
calamities
for
the
sole
purpose
of
illuminating
us
and
in
order
that
our
hearts
might
be
attracted
to
the
kingdom
of
god
our
faces
become
radiant
with
the
glad
tidings
of
god
in
order
that
we
might
be
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
lights
and
be
as
brilliant
and
shining
candles
illuminating
the
dark
recesses
and
flooding
the
regions
with
brightness
now
as
i
look
around
i
observe
that
your
facespraise
be
to
godare
shining
your
hearts
are
filled
with
the
love
of
god
and
you
are
thinking
of
service
in
the
cause
of
god
therefore
i
am
very
happy
to
be
here
and
i
hope
that
this
happiness
will
be
with
you
alwaysan
eternal
condition
we
visited
san
francisco
and
from
there
went
to
los
angeles
in
these
places
we
found
most
devoted
friends
truly
zealous
and
aglow
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
their
sole
purpose
is
ever
to
serve
the
kingdom
of
abha
i
hope
that
you
may
serve
even
more
faithfully
and
take
precedence
over
all
the
other
friends
may
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
be
so
enkindled
in
chicago
that
all
the
cities
in
america
shall
be
ignited
this
is
my
hope
my
third
visit
here
expresses
the
degree
of
my
longing
to
see
you
and
the
extent
of
my
love
it
was
thought
that
i
should
go
direct
from
san
francisco
to
new
york
and
thence
to
the
orient
but
impelled
by
excessive
love
i
have
visited
chicago
again
to
associate
with
you
in
fellowship
and
fragrance
i
hope
that
these
three
visits
may
be
most
productive
of
future
results
may
you
all
become
signs
of
unity
may
each
one
be
a
standard
of
bahaullah
each
one
shine
as
a
star
each
one
become
precious
and
worthy
in
the
kingdom
of
god
may
you
attain
such
a
condition
of
spirituality
that
the
people
will
be
astounded
saying
verily
these
souls
are
proofs
in
themselves
of
the
validity
of
bahaullah
for
through
his
training
they
have
been
completely
regenerated
these
souls
are
peerless
they
are
truly
the
people
of
the
kingdom
they
are
distinguished
above
the
people
about
them
this
is
in
reality
a
proof
of
bahaullah
behold
how
educated
and
illumined
they
have
become
when
this
cause
appeared
in
the
orient
the
friends
and
followers
were
selfsacrificing
to
the
utmost
forfeiting
everything
it
is
a
significant
and
wonderful
fact
that
although
the
most
precious
thing
on
earth
is
life
yet
twenty
thousand
people
offered
themselves
willingly
in
the
pathway
of
martyrdom
recently
in
yazd
two
hundred
of
the
bahai
friends
were
cruelly
slain
they
went
to
the
place
of
martyrdom
in
the
utmost
ecstasy
of
attraction
smiling
with
joy
and
gratitude
upon
their
persecutors
some
of
them
offered
sweetmeats
to
their
executioners
saying
taste
of
this
in
order
that
with
sweetness
and
enjoyment
you
may
bestow
upon
us
the
blessed
cup
of
martyrdom
among
these
beloved
and
glorified
ones
were
a
number
of
women
who
were
subjected
to
the
most
cruel
manner
of
execution
some
were
cut
to
pieces
and
their
executioners
not
content
with
such
butchery
set
others
on
fire
and
their
bodies
were
consumed
throughout
these
terrible
ordeals
not
a
single
soul
among
the
bahai
friends
objected
or
recanted
they
offered
no
resistance
although
the
bahais
in
that
city
were
most
courageous
and
strong
in
physical
strength
and
fortitude
one
of
these
bahais
could
have
withstood
many
of
their
enemies
but
they
accepted
martyrdom
in
the
spirit
of
complete
resignation
and
nonresistance
many
of
them
died
crying
out
o
lord
forgive
them
they
know
not
what
they
do
if
they
knew
they
would
not
commit
this
wrong
in
the
throes
of
martyrdom
they
willingly
offered
all
they
possessed
in
this
life
it
is
stated
in
certain
prophecies
that
when
the
standard
of
god
appears
in
the
east
its
signs
will
become
evident
in
the
west
this
is
truly
good
news
and
glad
tidings
for
you
i
hope
that
this
promise
may
be
fulfilled
in
you
and
that
all
may
be
able
to
testify
to
the
spirit
and
truth
of
the
prophetic
announcement
saying
verily
the
standard
of
god
did
appear
in
the
east
and
its
tokens
have
become
resplendent
in
the
west
this
realization
will
be
a
source
of
great
joy
to
all
the
friends
in
the
orient
who
anticipate
the
good
news
and
await
the
glad
tidings
from
the
land
of
the
occident
they
look
forward
to
hearing
that
the
friends
in
the
west
have
become
firm
and
steadfast
that
they
have
distinguished
themselves
by
establishing
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
that
they
are
even
offering
their
lives
for
the
foundations
of
international
peace
that
they
have
become
the
lights
of
the
kingdom
and
have
proved
to
be
the
manifestations
of
divine
mercy
that
the
friends
in
the
west
are
the
expression
of
the
favors
of
the
blessed
perfection
the
very
stars
of
the
bestowal
of
god
blessed
trees
and
flowers
in
the
garden
of
his
purity
and
sanctity
any
good
news
from
here
is
the
cause
of
rejoicing
in
the
east
and
a
source
of
deep
gratitude
to
them
they
hold
a
feast
and
praise
god
for
the
blessed
tidings
if
the
occasion
demanded
they
would
give
their
lives
for
you
without
the
least
hesitation
the
friends
in
the
east
are
all
united
and
agreed
there
are
none
who
waver
in
the
east
none
who
oppose
the
covenant
of
god
there
is
not
a
single
soul
among
the
bahais
in
persia
who
is
opposed
to
the
covenant
they
are
all
steadfast
if
any
soul
wishes
to
speak
in
this
cause
they
will
ask
is
this
a
word
of
your
own
or
is
it
by
the
authority
of
the
center
of
the
covenant
if
you
have
the
authority
of
the
center
of
the
covenant
produce
it
where
is
the
letter
from
him
where
is
his
signature
if
he
produces
the
letter
they
will
accept
it
if
he
fails
to
do
so
they
say
we
cannot
accept
your
words
because
they
emanate
from
you
only
and
return
to
you
we
have
no
command
from
the
blessed
perfection
bahaullah
to
obey
you
he
has
revealed
a
book
in
which
he
has
covenanted
with
us
to
obey
an
appointed
center
of
the
covenant
he
has
not
covenanted
with
us
to
obey
you
therefore
the
statement
you
make
is
rejected
you
must
furnish
proof
of
your
authority
and
sanction
we
are
commanded
to
turn
to
one
center
we
do
not
obey
various
centers
the
blessed
perfection
has
made
a
covenant
with
us
and
we
are
holding
to
this
covenant
and
testament
we
do
not
listen
to
anything
else
for
people
may
arise
who
speak
words
of
their
own
and
we
are
commanded
not
to
pay
attention
to
them
it
was
not
so
in
former
dispensations
christ
for
instance
did
not
appoint
a
center
of
authority
and
explanation
he
did
not
say
to
his
followers
obey
the
one
whom
i
have
chosen
upon
one
occasion
he
asked
his
disciples
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
simon
peter
answered
and
said
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
christ
wishing
to
make
firm
the
faith
of
peter
said
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
meaning
that
the
faith
of
peter
was
the
true
faith
it
was
a
sanction
of
peters
faith
he
did
not
say
that
all
should
turn
to
peter
he
did
not
say
he
is
the
branch
extended
from
my
ancient
root
he
did
not
say
o
god
bless
all
who
serve
peter
o
god
degrade
those
who
are
not
obedient
to
him
shun
him
who
is
a
violator
of
the
covenant
o
god
thou
knowest
that
i
love
all
who
are
steadfast
in
the
covenant
this
has
been
revealed
however
in
all
the
books
writings
and
epistles
of
bahaullah
regarding
the
appointed
center
of
the
covenant
in
this
dispensation
therefore
the
bahai
dispensation
is
distinguished
from
all
others
in
this
fact
the
purpose
of
bahaullah
being
that
no
one
could
arise
to
cause
differences
and
disunion
after
the
departure
of
christ
various
sects
and
denominations
arose
each
one
claiming
to
be
the
true
channel
of
christianity
but
none
of
them
possessed
a
written
authority
from
christ
none
could
produce
proof
from
him
yet
all
claimed
his
sanction
and
approval
bahaullah
has
written
a
covenant
and
testament
with
his
own
pen
declaring
that
the
one
whom
he
has
appointed
the
center
of
the
covenant
shall
be
turned
to
and
obeyed
by
all
therefore
thank
god
that
bahaullah
has
made
the
pathway
straight
he
has
clearly
explained
all
things
and
opened
every
door
for
advancing
souls
there
is
no
reason
for
hesitation
by
anyone
the
purpose
of
the
covenant
was
simply
to
ward
off
disunion
and
differences
so
that
no
one
might
say
my
opinion
is
the
true
and
valid
one
any
opinion
expressed
by
the
center
of
the
covenant
is
correct
and
there
is
no
reason
for
disobedience
by
anyone
be
watchful
for
perchance
there
may
be
violators
naqidin
of
the
covenant
among
you
do
not
listen
to
them
read
the
book
of
the
covenant
all
have
been
commanded
to
obey
the
covenant
and
the
first
admonition
is
addressed
to
the
sons
of
bahaullah
the
branches
you
must
turn
to
the
appointed
center
he
is
the
expounder
of
the
book
should
any
soul
so
clearly
violate
and
disobey
this
command
can
he
even
say
he
is
a
bahai
if
anyone
disobeys
the
explicit
command
of
christ
can
he
truthfully
say
he
is
a
christian
in
conclusion
i
would
say
that
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
this
meeting
i
shall
pray
for
you
seeking
confirmation
from
the
blessed
perfection
praise
be
to
god
you
must
be
grateful
that
he
has
chosen
you
from
among
the
people
of
the
world
that
such
glorious
bestowal
and
such
endless
graces
and
favors
have
been
specialized
for
you
you
must
not
look
at
present
accomplishments
for
this
is
but
the
beginning
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
christ
before
long
you
will
see
that
you
will
be
distinguished
among
all
people
in
every
way
the
divine
confirmation
will
uphold
you
and
the
radiance
of
the
kingdom
of
bahaullah
will
illumine
your
countenances
be
truly
grateful
for
all
these
blessings
i
hope
i
may
always
hear
good
news
of
you
showing
that
the
friends
in
chicago
are
occupied
with
service
in
the
divine
cause
filled
with
the
joy
of
promoting
the
word
of
god
engaged
in
spreading
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
and
manifesting
love
and
kindness
to
all
humanity
this
is
my
hope
and
anticipation
i
am
sure
that
you
will
endeavor
to
accomplish
this
so
that
the
friends
in
persia
and
i
may
experience
the
happiness
of
the
good
tidings
may
you
be
a
source
of
joy
and
happiness
to
us
a
source
of
tranquillity
and
composure

from
stenographic

as
we
are
in
cincinnati
the
home
of
president
taft
who
has
rendered
such
noble
service
in
the
cause
of
peace
i
will
dictate
a
statement
for
the
people
of
cincinnati
and
america
generally
in
the
orient
i
was
informed
that
there
are
many
lovers
of
peace
in
america
therefore
i
left
my
native
land
to
associate
here
with
those
who
are
the
standardbearers
of
international
conciliation
and
agreement
having
traveled
from
coast
to
coast
i
find
the
united
states
of
america
vast
and
progressive
the
government
just
and
equitable
the
nation
noble
and
independent
i
attended
many
meetings
where
international
peace
was
discussed
and
am
always
extremely
happy
to
witness
the
results
of
such
meetings
for
one
of
the
great
principles
of
bahaullahs
teachings
is
the
establishment
of
agreement
among
the
peoples
of
the
world
he
founded
and
taught
this
principle
in
the
orient
fifty
years
ago
he
proclaimed
international
unity
summoned
the
religions
of
the
world
to
harmony
and
reconciliation
and
established
fellowship
among
many
races
sects
and
communities
at
that
time
he
wrote
epistles
to
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
world
calling
upon
them
to
arise
and
cooperate
with
him
in
spreading
these
principles
saying
that
the
stability
and
advancement
of
humanity
could
only
be
realized
through
the
unity
of
the
nations
through
his
efforts
this
principle
of
universal
harmony
and
agreement
was
practically
demonstrated
in
persia
and
other
countries
today
in
persia
for
instance
there
are
many
people
of
various
races
and
religions
who
have
followed
the
exhortations
of
bahaullah
and
are
living
together
in
love
and
fellowship
without
religious
patriotic
or
racial
prejudicesmuslims
jews
christians
buddhists
zoroastrians
and
many
others
america
has
arisen
to
spread
the
teachings
of
peace
to
increase
the
illumination
of
humankind
and
bestow
happiness
and
prosperity
upon
the
children
of
men
these
are
the
principles
and
evidences
of
divine
civilization
america
is
a
noble
nation
the
standardbearer
of
peace
throughout
the
world
shedding
light
to
all
regions
foreign
nations
are
not
untrammeled
and
free
from
intrigues
and
complications
like
the
united
states
therefore
they
are
not
able
to
bring
about
universal
harmony
but
americapraise
be
to
godis
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
is
worthy
of
raising
the
flag
of
brotherhood
and
international
agreement
when
this
is
done
the
rest
of
the
world
will
accept
all
nations
will
join
in
adopting
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
revealed
more
than
fifty
years
ago
in
his
epistles
he
asked
the
parliaments
of
the
world
to
send
their
wisest
and
best
men
to
an
international
world
conference
which
should
decide
all
questions
between
the
peoples
and
establish
universal
peace
this
would
be
the
highest
court
of
appeal
and
the
parliament
of
man
so
long
dreamed
of
by
poets
and
idealists
would
be
realized
its
accomplishment
would
be
more
farreaching
than
the
hague
tribunal
i
am
most
grateful
to
president
taft
for
having
extended
his
influence
toward
the
establishment
of
universal
peace
what
he
has
accomplished
in
making
treaties
with
various
nations
is
very
good
but
when
we
have
the
interparliamentary
body
composed
of
delegates
from
all
the
nations
of
the
world
and
devoted
to
the
maintenance
of
agreement
and
goodwill
the
utopian
dream
of
sages
and
poets
the
parliament
of
man
will
be
realized

notes

hannen
praise
be
to
god
the
standard
of
liberty
is
held
aloft
in
this
land
you
enjoy
political
liberty
you
enjoy
liberty
of
thought
and
speech
religious
liberty
racial
and
personal
liberty
surely
this
is
worthy
of
appreciation
and
thanksgiving
in
this
connection
let
me
mention
the
freedom
hospitality
and
universal
welcome
extended
to
me
during
my
recent
travels
throughout
america
i
wish
also
to
reciprocate
fully
and
completely
the
warm
greeting
and
friendly
attitude
of
the
reverend
doctor
pastor
of
this
church
whose
loving
and
quickened
susceptibilities
especially
command
acknowledgment
surely
men
who
are
leaders
of
thought
must
conform
to
the
example
of
his
kindliness
and
goodwill
liberalism
is
essential
in
this
dayjustness
and
equity
toward
all
nations
and
people
human
attitudes
must
not
be
limited
for
god
is
unlimited
and
whosoever
is
the
servant
of
the
threshold
of
god
must
likewise
be
free
from
limitations
the
world
of
existence
is
an
emanation
of
the
merciful
attribute
of
god
god
has
shone
forth
upon
the
phenomena
of
being
through
his
effulgence
of
mercy
and
he
is
clement
and
kind
to
all
his
creation
therefore
the
world
of
humanity
must
ever
be
the
recipient
of
bounties
from
his
majesty
the
eternal
lord
even
as
christ
has
declared
be
ye
therefore
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
for
his
bounties
like
the
light
and
heat
of
the
sun
in
the
material
heavens
descend
alike
upon
all
mankind
consequently
man
must
learn
the
lesson
of
kindness
and
beneficence
from
god
himself
just
as
god
is
kind
to
all
humanity
man
also
must
be
kind
to
his
fellow
creatures
if
his
attitude
is
just
and
loving
toward
his
fellowmen
toward
all
creation
then
indeed
is
he
worthy
of
being
pronounced
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
brotherhood
or
fraternity
is
of
different
kinds
it
may
be
family
association
the
intimate
relationship
of
the
household
this
is
limited
and
subject
to
change
and
disruption
how
often
it
happens
that
in
a
family
love
and
agreement
are
changed
into
enmity
and
antagonism
another
form
of
fraternity
is
manifest
in
patriotism
man
loves
his
fellowmen
because
they
belong
to
the
same
native
land
this
is
also
limited
and
subject
to
change
and
disintegration
as
for
instance
when
sons
of
the
same
fatherland
are
opposed
to
each
other
in
war
bloodshed
and
battle
still
another
brotherhood
or
fraternity
is
that
which
arises
from
racial
unity
the
oneness
of
racial
origin
producing
ties
of
affinity
and
association
this
likewise
has
its
limitation
and
liability
to
change
for
often
war
and
deadly
strife
have
been
witnessed
between
people
and
nations
of
the
same
racial
lineage
there
is
a
fourth
kind
of
brotherhood
the
attitude
of
man
toward
humanity
itself
the
altruistic
love
of
humankind
and
recognition
of
the
fundamental
human
bond
although
this
is
unlimited
it
is
nevertheless
susceptible
to
change
and
destruction
even
from
this
universal
fraternal
bond
the
lookedfor
result
does
not
appear
what
is
the
lookedfor
result
lovingkindness
among
all
human
creatures
and
a
firm
indestructible
brotherhood
which
includes
all
the
divine
possibilities
and
significances
in
humanity
therefore
it
is
evident
that
fraternity
love
and
kindness
based
upon
family
native
land
race
or
an
attitude
of
altruism
are
neither
sufficient
nor
permanent
since
all
of
them
are
limited
restricted
and
liable
to
change
and
disruption
for
in
the
family
there
is
discord
and
alienation
among
sons
of
the
same
fatherland
strife
and
internecine
warfare
are
witnessed
between
those
of
a
given
race
hostility
and
hatred
are
frequent
and
even
among
the
altruists
varying
aspects
of
opinion
and
lack
of
unselfish
devotion
give
little
promise
of
permanent
and
indestructible
unity
among
mankind
therefore
the
lord
of
mankind
has
caused
his
holy
divine
manifestations
to
come
into
the
world
he
has
revealed
his
heavenly
books
in
order
to
establish
spiritual
brotherhood
and
through
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
has
made
it
practicable
for
perfect
fraternity
to
be
realized
among
mankind
and
when
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
this
perfect
fraternity
and
agreement
are
established
amongst
menthis
brotherhood
and
love
being
spiritual
in
character
this
lovingkindness
being
heavenly
these
constraining
bonds
being
divinea
unity
appears
which
is
indissoluble
unchanging
and
never
subject
to
transformation
it
is
ever
the
same
and
will
forever
remain
the
same
for
example
consider
the
foundation
of
the
brotherhood
laid
by
christ
observe
how
that
fraternity
was
conducive
to
unity
and
accord
and
how
it
brought
various
souls
to
a
plane
of
uniform
attainment
where
they
were
willing
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
each
other
they
were
content
to
renounce
possessions
and
ready
to
forfeit
joyously
life
itself
they
lived
together
in
such
love
and
fellowship
that
even
galen
the
famous
greek
philosopher
who
was
not
a
christian
in
his
work
entitled
the
progress
of
the
nations
said
that
religious
beliefs
are
greatly
conducive
to
the
foundation
of
real
civilization
as
a
proof
thereof
he
said
a
certain
number
of
people
contemporaneous
with
us
are
known
as
christians
these
enjoy
the
superlative
degree
of
moral
civilization
each
one
of
them
is
as
a
great
philosopher
because
they
live
together
in
the
utmost
love
and
good
fellowship
they
sacrifice
life
for
each
other
they
offer
worldly
possessions
for
each
other
you
can
say
of
the
christian
people
that
they
are
as
one
person
there
is
a
bond
amongst
them
that
is
indissoluble
in
character
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
foundation
of
real
brotherhood
the
cause
of
loving
cooperation
and
reciprocity
and
the
source
of
real
kindness
and
unselfish
devotion
is
none
other
than
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
without
this
influence
and
animus
it
is
impossible
we
may
be
able
to
realize
some
degrees
of
fraternity
through
other
motives
but
these
are
limited
associations
and
subject
to
change
when
human
brotherhood
is
founded
upon
the
holy
spirit
it
is
eternal
changeless
unlimited
in
various
parts
of
the
orient
there
was
a
time
when
brotherhood
lovingkindness
and
all
the
praiseworthy
qualities
of
mankind
seemed
to
have
disappeared
there
was
no
evidence
of
patriotic
religious
or
racial
fraternity
but
conditions
of
bigotry
hatred
and
prejudice
prevailed
instead
the
adherents
of
each
religion
were
violent
enemies
of
the
others
filled
with
the
spirit
of
hostility
and
eager
for
shedding
of
blood
the
present
war
in
the
balkans
furnishes
a
parallel
of
these
conditions
consider
the
bloodshed
ferocity
and
oppression
manifested
there
even
in
this
enlightened
centuryall
of
it
based
fundamentally
upon
religious
prejudice
and
disagreement
for
the
nations
involved
belong
to
the
same
races
and
native
lands
nevertheless
they
are
savage
and
merciless
toward
each
other
similar
deplorable
conditions
prevailed
in
persia
in
the
nineteenth
century
darkness
and
ignorant
fanaticism
were
widespread
no
trace
of
fellowship
or
brotherhood
existed
amongst
the
races
on
the
contrary
human
hearts
were
filled
with
rage
and
hatred
darkness
and
gloom
were
manifest
in
human
lives
and
conditions
everywhere
at
such
a
time
as
this
bahaullah
appeared
upon
the
divine
horizon
even
as
the
glory
of
the
sun
and
in
that
gross
darkness
and
hopelessness
of
the
human
world
there
shone
a
great
light
he
founded
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
declaring
that
all
mankind
are
as
sheep
and
that
god
is
the
real
and
true
shepherd
the
shepherd
is
one
and
all
people
are
of
his
flock
the
world
of
humanity
is
one
and
god
is
equally
kind
to
all
what
then
is
the
source
of
unkindness
and
hatred
in
the
human
world
this
real
shepherd
loves
all
his
sheep
he
leads
them
in
green
pastures
he
rears
and
protects
them
what
then
is
the
source
of
enmity
and
alienation
among
humankind
whence
this
conflict
and
strife
the
real
underlying
cause
is
lack
of
religious
unity
and
association
for
in
each
of
the
great
religions
we
find
superstition
blind
imitation
of
creeds
and
theological
formulas
adhered
to
instead
of
the
divine
fundamentals
causing
difference
and
divergence
among
mankind
instead
of
agreement
and
fellowship
consequently
strife
hatred
and
warfare
have
arisen
based
upon
this
divergence
and
separation
if
we
investigate
the
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
we
find
them
to
be
one
absolutely
changeless
and
never
subject
to
transformation
for
example
each
of
the
divine
religions
contains
two
kinds
of
laws
or
ordinances
one
division
concerns
the
world
of
morality
and
ethical
institutions
these
are
the
essential
ordinances
they
instill
and
awaken
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
love
for
humanity
the
virtues
of
the
world
of
mankind
the
attributes
of
the
divine
kingdom
rebirth
and
resurrection
from
the
kingdom
of
nature
these
constitute
one
kind
of
divine
law
which
is
common
to
all
and
never
subject
to
change
from
the
dawn
of
the
adamic
cycle
to
the
present
day
this
fundamental
law
of
god
has
continued
changeless
this
is
the
foundation
of
divine
religion
the
second
division
comprises
laws
and
institutions
which
provide
for
human
needs
and
conditions
according
to
exigencies
of
time
and
place
these
are
accidental
of
no
essential
importance
and
should
never
have
been
made
the
cause
and
source
of
human
contention
for
example
during
the
time
of
mosesupon
him
be
peaceaccording
to
the
exigencies
of
that
period
divorce
was
permissible
during
the
cycle
of
christ
inasmuch
as
divorce
was
not
in
conformity
with
the
time
and
conditions
jesus
christ
abrogated
it
in
the
cycle
of
moses
plurality
of
wives
was
permissible
but
during
the
time
of
christ
the
exigency
which
had
sanctioned
it
did
not
exist
therefore
it
was
forbidden
moses
lived
in
the
wilderness
and
desert
of
sinai
therefore
his
ordinances
and
commandments
were
in
conformity
with
those
conditions
the
penalty
for
theft
was
to
cut
off
a
mans
hand
an
ordinance
of
this
kind
was
in
keeping
with
desert
life
but
is
not
compatible
with
conditions
of
the
present
day
such
ordinances
therefore
constitute
the
second
or
nonessential
division
of
the
divine
religions
and
are
not
of
importance
for
they
deal
with
human
transactions
which
are
ever
changing
according
to
the
requirements
of
time
and
place
therefore
the
intrinsic
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
are
one
as
this
is
true
why
should
hostility
and
strife
exist
among
them
why
should
this
hatred
and
warfare
ferocity
and
bloodshed
continue
is
this
allowable
and
justified
god
forbid
an
essential
principle
of
bahaullahs
teaching
is
that
religion
must
be
the
cause
of
unity
and
love
amongst
men
that
it
is
the
supreme
effulgence
of
divinity
the
stimulus
of
life
the
source
of
honor
and
productive
of
eternal
existence
religion
is
not
intended
to
arouse
enmity
and
hatred
nor
to
become
the
source
of
tyranny
and
injustice
should
it
prove
to
be
the
cause
of
hostility
discord
and
the
alienation
of
mankind
assuredly
the
absence
of
religion
would
be
preferable
religious
teachings
are
like
a
course
of
treatment
having
for
its
purpose
the
cure
and
healing
of
mankind
if
the
only
outcome
of
a
course
of
treatment
should
be
mere
diagnosis
and
fruitless
discussion
of
symptoms
it
would
be
better
to
abandon
and
abolish
it
in
this
sense
the
absence
of
religion
would
be
at
least
some
progress
toward
unity
furthermore
religion
must
conform
to
reason
and
be
in
accord
with
the
conclusions
of
science
for
religion
reason
and
science
are
realities
therefore
these
three
being
realities
must
conform
and
be
reconciled
a
question
or
principle
which
is
religious
in
its
nature
must
be
sanctioned
by
science
science
must
declare
it
to
be
valid
and
reason
must
confirm
it
in
order
that
it
may
inspire
confidence
if
religious
teaching
however
be
at
variance
with
science
and
reason
it
is
unquestionably
superstition
the
lord
of
mankind
has
bestowed
upon
us
the
faculty
of
reason
whereby
we
may
discern
the
realities
of
things
how
then
can
man
rightfully
accept
any
proposition
which
is
not
in
conformity
with
the
processes
of
reason
and
the
principles
of
science
assuredly
such
a
course
cannot
inspire
man
with
confidence
and
real
belief
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
embody
many
principles
i
am
giving
you
only
a
synopsis
one
of
these
principles
concerns
equality
between
men
and
women
he
declared
that
as
all
are
created
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
the
one
god
there
is
no
distinction
as
to
sex
in
the
estimation
of
god
he
who
is
purest
in
heart
whose
knowledge
exceeds
and
who
excels
in
kindness
to
the
servants
of
god
is
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
lord
our
creator
irrespective
of
sex
in
the
lower
kingdoms
the
animal
and
vegetable
we
find
sex
differentiation
in
function
and
organism
all
plants
trees
and
animals
are
subject
to
that
differentiation
by
creation
but
among
themselves
there
is
absolute
equality
without
further
distinction
as
to
sex
why
then
should
mankind
make
a
distinction
which
the
lower
creatures
do
not
regard
especially
so
when
we
realize
that
all
are
of
the
same
kingdom
and
kindred
that
all
are
the
leaves
of
one
tree
the
waves
of
one
sea
the
only
reasonable
explanation
is
that
woman
has
not
been
afforded
the
same
educational
facilities
as
man
for
if
she
had
received
the
same
opportunities
for
training
and
development
as
man
has
enjoyed
undoubtedly
she
would
have
attained
the
same
station
and
level
in
the
estimate
of
god
no
distinction
exists
both
are
as
one
and
possess
equal
degrees
of
capacity
therefore
through
opportunity
and
development
woman
will
merit
and
attain
the
same
prerogatives
when
jesus
christ
died
upon
the
cross
the
disciples
who
witnessed
his
crucifixion
were
disturbed
and
shaken
even
peter
one
of
the
greatest
of
his
followers
denied
him
thrice
mary
magdalene
brought
them
together
and
confirmed
their
faith
saying
why
are
ye
doubting
why
have
ye
feared
o
thou
peter
why
didst
thou
deny
him
for
christ
was
not
crucified
the
reality
of
christ
is
everliving
everlasting
eternal
for
that
divine
reality
there
is
no
beginning
no
ending
and
therefore
there
can
be
no
death
at
most
only
the
body
of
jesus
has
suffered
death
in
brief
this
woman
singly
and
alone
was
instrumental
in
transforming
the
disciples
and
making
them
steadfast
this
is
an
evidence
of
extraordinary
power
and
supreme
attributes
a
proof
that
woman
is
the
equivalent
and
complement
of
man
the
one
who
is
better
trained
and
educated
whose
aptitude
is
greater
and
whose
ideals
are
higher
is
most
distinguished
and
worthywhether
man
or
woman
through
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
the
horizon
of
the
east
was
made
radiant
and
glorious
souls
who
have
hearkened
to
his
words
and
accepted
his
message
live
together
today
in
complete
fellowship
and
love
they
even
offer
their
lives
for
each
other
they
forego
and
renounce
worldly
possessions
for
one
another
each
preferring
the
other
to
himself
this
has
been
due
to
the
declaration
and
foundation
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
today
in
persia
there
are
meetings
and
assemblages
wherein
souls
who
have
become
illumined
by
the
teachings
of
bahaullahrepresentative
muslims
christians
jews
zoroastrians
buddhists
and
of
the
various
denominations
of
eachmingle
and
conjoin
in
perfect
fellowship
and
absolute
agreement
a
wonderful
brotherhood
and
love
is
established
among
them
and
all
are
united
in
spirit
and
service
for
international
peace
more
than
twenty
thousand
bahais
have
given
their
lives
in
martyrdom
for
the
cause
of
god
the
governments
of
the
east
arose
against
them
bent
upon
their
extermination
they
were
killed
relentlessly
but
day
by
day
their
numbers
have
increased
day
by
day
they
have
multiplied
in
strength
and
become
more
eloquent
they
have
been
strengthened
through
the
efficacy
of
a
wonderful
spiritual
power
how
savage
and
fearful
the
ferocity
of
man
against
his
fellowman
consider
what
is
taking
place
now
in
the
balkans
what
blood
is
being
shed
even
the
wild
beasts
and
ferocious
animals
do
not
commit
such
acts
the
most
ferocious
wolf
kills
but
one
sheep
a
day
and
even
that
for
his
food
but
now
in
the
balkans
one
man
destroys
ten
fellow
beings
the
commanders
of
armies
glory
in
having
killed
ten
thousand
men
not
for
food
nay
rather
for
military
control
territorial
greed
fame
and
possession
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
they
kill
for
national
aggrandizement
notwithstanding
this
terrestrial
globe
is
but
a
dark
world
of
grossest
matter
it
is
a
world
of
sorrow
and
grief
a
world
of
disappointment
and
unhappiness
a
world
of
death
for
after
all
the
earth
is
but
the
everlasting
graveyard
the
vast
universal
cemetery
of
all
mankind
yet
men
fight
to
possess
this
graveyard
waging
war
and
battle
killing
each
other
what
ignorance
how
spacious
the
earth
is
with
room
in
plenty
for
all
how
thoughtful
the
providence
which
has
so
allotted
that
every
man
may
derive
his
sustenance
from
it
the
lord
our
creator
does
not
ordain
that
anyone
should
starve
or
live
in
want
all
are
intended
to
participate
in
the
blessed
and
abundant
bestowals
of
our
god
fundamentally
all
warfare
and
bloodshed
in
the
human
world
are
due
to
the
lack
of
unity
between
the
religions
which
through
superstitions
and
adherence
to
theological
dogmas
have
obscured
the
one
reality
which
is
the
source
and
basis
of
them
all
as
to
the
american
people
this
noble
nation
intelligent
thoughtful
reflective
is
not
impelled
by
motives
of
territorial
aggrandizement
and
lust
for
dominion
its
boundaries
are
insular
and
geographically
separated
from
the
other
nations
here
we
find
a
oneness
of
interest
and
unity
of
national
policy
these
are
indeed
united
states
therefore
this
nation
possesses
the
capacity
and
capability
for
holding
aloft
the
banner
of
international
peace
may
this
noble
people
be
the
cause
of
unifying
humanity
may
they
spread
broadcast
the
heavenly
civilization
and
illumination
become
the
cause
of
the
diffusion
of
the
love
of
god
proclaim
the
solidarity
of
mankind
and
be
the
cause
of
the
guidance
of
the
human
race
therefore
i
ask
that
you
will
give
this
allimportant
question
your
most
serious
consideration
and
efforts
may
the
world
of
humanity
find
peace
and
composure
and
this
dark
earth
be
transformed
into
a
realm
of
radiance
may
the
east
and
west
clasp
hands
together
may
the
oneness
of
god
become
reflected
and
fully
revealed
in
the
hearts
of
humanity
and
all
mankind
prove
to
be
the
manifestations
of
the
favors
of
god
necessarily
there
will
be
some
who
are
defective
amongst
men
but
it
is
our
duty
to
enable
them
by
kind
methods
of
guidance
and
teaching
to
become
perfected
some
will
be
found
who
are
morally
sick
they
should
be
treated
in
order
that
they
may
be
healed
others
are
immature
and
like
children
they
must
be
trained
and
educated
so
that
they
may
become
wise
and
mature
those
who
are
asleep
must
be
awakened
the
indifferent
must
become
mindful
and
attentive
but
all
this
must
be
accomplished
in
the
spirit
of
kindness
and
love
and
not
by
strife
antagonism
nor
in
a
spirit
of
hostility
and
hatred
for
this
is
contrary
to
the
good
pleasure
of
god
that
which
is
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
god
is
love
love
is
in
reality
the
first
effulgence
of
divinity
and
the
greatest
splendor
of
god

consider
events
in
the
balkans
today
where
a
great
conflagration
of
war
is
furiously
raging
and
so
much
blood
is
being
shed
virtually
the
whole
world
of
humanity
is
mourning
and
lamenting
because
of
the
revival
of
these
calamitous
conditions
governments
are
in
the
process
of
change
and
transformation
the
sovereignty
of
oriental
nations
is
tottering
outcomes
are
wrapped
in
the
greatest
uncertainty
i
desire
therefore
to
speak
to
you
upon
this
subject
i
will
call
your
attention
more
especially
to
the
aspects
of
this
war
which
bahaullah
prophesied
forty
years
ago
fully
and
completely
during
his
exile
and
while
under
surveillance
in
the
prison
of
akka
he
addressed
a
letter
to
the
sultan
of
turkey
he
likewise
sent
epistles
to
napoleon
iii
and
to
the
shah
of
persia
all
his
letters
to
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
earth
were
compiled
in
a
book
published
thirtyfive
years
ago
in

there
were
several
editions
of
this
book
i
have
with
me
a
copy
of
an
edition
published
twentytwo
years
ago
in
professor
e
g
browne
of
cambridge
university
england
wrote
a
book
detailing
his
visit
to
akka
this
was
followed
by
a
second
volume
in
which
he
quoted
extracts
from
bahaullahs
epistles
to
the
kings
and
rulers
there
are
also
translations
of
some
of
these
epistles
in
your
libraries
when
you
get
them
you
will
read
the
remarkable
statements
made
by
bahaullah
i
will
read
to
you
from
the
arabic
text
the
very
words
written
by
bahaullah
in
his
epistle
to
the
sultan
of
turkey
they
will
be
translated
to
you
as
i
read
o
king
thou
hast
committed
that
by
reason
of
which
muhammad
the
prophet
of
god
lamenteth
in
the
highest
heaven
verily
the
world
hath
made
thee
proud
so
that
thou
hast
turned
away
from
the
face
of
him
by
whose
light
the
people
of
the
supreme
assembly
are
illuminated
and
erelong
thou
shalt
find
thyself
in
manifest
loss
thou
hast
united
with
the
persian
chief
in
opposition
to
me
after
i
came
unto
you
from
the
rising
place
of
greatness
and
might
with
a
matter
which
has
consoled
the
eyes
of
those
near
unto
god
verily
this
is
a
day
wherein
the
fire
speaketh
through
all
things
declaring
that
the
beloved
of
the
two
worlds
hath
come
and
on
the
part
of
everything
an
interlocutor
of
the
matter
hath
sprung
up
to
listen
unto
the
word
of
thy
lord
the
precious
the
knowing
dost
thou
imagine
that
thou
canst
quench
the
fire
which
god
hath
kindled
in
the
horizons
no
by
himself
the
true
one
wert
thou
of
those
who
know
rather
by
that
which
thou
hast
done
its
burning
is
increased
and
its
blaze
augmented
and
it
shall
encompass
the
earth
and
whosoever
is
thereupon
thus
the
matter
hath
been
decreed
and
whosoever
is
in
the
heavens
and
upon
the
earth
could
not
withstand
his
command
the
day
is
approaching
when
the
land
of
mystery
adrianople
and
what
is
beside
it
shall
be
changed
and
shall
pass
out
of
the
hands
of
the
king
and
commotions
shall
appear
and
the
voice
of
lamentation
shall
be
raised
and
the
evidences
of
mischief
shall
be
revealed
on
all
sides
and
confusion
shall
spread
by
reason
of
that
which
hath
befallen
these
captives
at
the
hands
of
the
hosts
of
oppression
the
course
of
things
shall
be
altered
and
conditions
shall
wax
so
grievous
that
the
very
sands
on
the
desolate
hills
will
moan
and
the
trees
on
the
mountain
will
weep
and
blood
will
flow
out
of
all
things
then
wilt
thou
behold
the
people
in
sore
distress
was
pharaoh
able
to
hinder
god
by
exercising
his
dominion
when
he
rebelled
upon
the
earth
and
was
of
the
disobedient
we
have
indeed
manifested
the
interlocutor
moses
from
his
house
in
spite
of
his
will
verily
we
were
able
to
do
this
and
remember
when
nimrod
kindled
the
fire
of
polytheism
whereby
he
would
burn
the
friend
of
god
abraham
verily
we
extinguished
the
fire
by
the
truth
and
brought
upon
nimrod
manifest
grief
verily
the
oppressor
king
of
persia
slew
the
beloved
of
the
worlds
the
bab
that
he
might
thereby
extinguish
the
light
of
god
among
his
creatures
and
deprive
mankind
of
the
pure
water
of
life
in
the
days
of
his
lord
the
mighty
the
kind
we
have
made
the
matter
manifest
in
the
country
and
elevated
his
mention
among
the
unitarians
verily
the
servant
hath
assuredly
come
to
vivify
the
world
and
bring
to
union
whosoever
is
upon
the
surface
of
the
whole
earth
that
which
god
willeth
shall
overcome
and
thou
shalt
see
the
earth
as
the
garden
of
abha
thus
hath
it
been
written
by
the
pen
of
command
in
an
irrevocable
tablet
there
are
many
other
prophecies
in
this
book
especially
in
the
epistle
to
the
shah
of
persia
all
of
which
prophecies
have
come
to
pass
as
they
are
lengthy
we
will
not
have
time
to
quote
them
the
purpose
of
these
quotations
is
to
show
that
bahaullahs
great
endeavor
in
the
east
was
to
unify
mankind
to
cause
them
to
agree
and
become
reconciled
thereby
manifesting
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
preparing
the
way
for
international
peace
and
establishing
the
foundations
of
happiness
and
welfare
but
the
nations
have
not
hearkened
to
his
summons
and
message
the
persian
and
turkish
governments
arose
against
his
cause
and
the
result
is
that
both
these
governments
have
been
disintegrated
and
broken
had
they
been
attentive
to
his
commands
and
received
his
admonitions
they
would
have
been
protected
they
would
have
enjoyed
happiness
and
prosperity
they
would
have
been
bound
together
in
ties
of
fellowship
and
brotherhood
availing
themselves
of
the
wonderful
bounties
of
love
and
unity
and
dwelling
in
the
delectable
paradise
of
the
divine
kingdom
but
alas
the
commands
and
guidance
of
the
blessed
one
have
been
neglected
and
ignored
day
by
day
they
have
followed
their
own
devices
and
imaginations
until
now
this
fire
of
war
is
raging
most
furiously

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
in
the
world
of
nature
we
behold
the
living
organisms
in
a
ceaseless
struggle
for
existence
everywhere
we
are
confronted
by
evidences
of
the
physical
survival
of
the
fittest
this
is
the
very
source
of
error
and
misapprehension
in
the
opinions
and
theories
of
men
who
fail
to
realize
that
the
world
of
nature
is
inherently
defective
in
cause
and
outcome
and
that
the
defects
therein
must
be
removed
by
education
for
example
consider
man
himself
if
we
study
human
beings
such
as
the
aboriginal
tribes
of
central
africa
who
have
been
reared
in
complete
subjection
to
natures
rule
we
will
find
them
deficient
indeed
they
are
without
religious
education
neither
do
they
give
evidences
of
any
advance
whatever
toward
civilization
they
have
simply
grown
and
developed
in
the
natural
plane
of
barbarism
we
find
them
bloodthirsty
immoral
and
animalistic
in
type
to
such
an
extent
that
they
even
kill
and
devour
each
other
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
world
of
nature
unassisted
is
imperfect
because
it
is
a
plane
upon
which
the
struggle
for
physical
existence
expresses
itself
if
a
piece
of
ground
is
left
in
its
natural
state
wild
weeds
thorns
and
trees
of
the
jungle
will
grow
upon
it
but
if
we
cultivate
that
same
piece
of
ground
the
result
will
be
that
it
will
rid
itself
of
natural
imperfections
and
become
transformed
into
a
beautiful
rose
garden
or
an
orchard
of
fruitful
trees
this
is
proof
that
the
world
of
nature
is
defective
the
founding
of
schools
and
establishing
of
educational
systems
in
the
world
are
intended
to
replace
the
defects
of
nature
with
virtues
and
perfections
if
there
were
no
defects
there
would
be
no
need
of
training
culture
and
education
but
inasmuch
as
we
find
that
children
need
training
and
schooling
it
is
a
conclusive
proof
that
the
world
of
nature
must
be
developed
many
things
show
this
clearly
one
of
the
basic
evidences
is
the
survival
of
the
fittest
in
the
animal
kingdom
their
ignorance
sensuality
and
unbridled
instincts
and
passions
therefore
in
the
natural
world
there
is
need
of
an
educator
and
teacher
for
mankind
he
must
be
universal
in
his
powers
and
accomplishments
teachers
are
of
two
kinds
universal
and
special
the
universal
instructors
are
the
prophets
of
god
and
the
special
teachers
are
the
philosophers
the
philosophers
are
capable
of
educating
and
training
a
limited
circle
of
human
souls
whereas
the
holy
divine
manifestations
of
god
confer
general
education
upon
humanity
they
arise
to
bestow
universal
moral
training
for
example
moses
was
a
universal
teacher
he
trained
and
disciplined
the
people
of
israel
enabled
them
to
rescue
themselves
from
the
lowest
abyss
of
despair
and
ignorance
and
caused
them
to
attain
an
advanced
degree
of
knowledge
and
development
they
were
captives
and
in
the
bondage
of
slavery
through
him
they
became
free
he
led
them
out
of
egypt
into
the
holy
land
and
opened
the
doors
of
their
advancement
into
higher
civilization
through
his
training
this
oppressed
and
downtrodden
people
slaves
and
captives
of
the
pharaohs
established
the
splendor
of
the
solomonic
sovereignty
this
is
an
example
of
a
universal
teacher
a
universal
educator
again
consider
christ
how
that
marvelous
expression
of
unity
bestowed
education
and
ethical
training
upon
the
roman
greek
egyptian
syrian
and
assyrian
nations
and
welded
together
a
people
from
them
in
a
permanent
and
indissoluble
bond
these
nations
were
formerly
at
enmity
and
in
a
state
of
continual
hostility
and
strife
he
cemented
them
together
caused
them
to
agree
conferred
tranquillity
upon
humanity
and
established
the
foundations
of
human
welfare
throughout
the
world
therefore
he
was
a
real
educator
the
instructor
of
reality
when
we
review
the
conditions
existing
in
the
east
prior
to
the
rise
of
the
prophet
of
arabia
we
find
that
throughout
the
arabian
peninsula
intense
mental
darkness
and
the
utmost
ignorance
prevailed
among
its
inhabitants
those
tribal
peoples
were
constantly
engaged
in
war
killing
and
shedding
blood
burning
and
pillaging
the
homes
of
each
other
and
living
in
conditions
of
the
utmost
debasement
and
immorality
they
were
lower
and
more
brutal
than
the
animals
muhammad
appeared
as
a
prophet
among
such
a
people
he
educated
these
barbarous
tribes
lifted
them
out
of
their
ignorance
and
savagery
and
put
an
end
to
the
continuous
strife
and
hatred
which
had
existed
among
them
he
established
agreement
and
reconciliation
among
them
unified
them
and
taught
them
to
look
upon
each
other
as
brothers
through
his
training
they
advanced
rapidly
in
prestige
and
civilization
they
were
formerly
ignorant
they
became
wise
they
were
barbarous
they
attained
refinement
and
culture
they
were
debased
and
brutal
he
uplifted
and
elevated
them
they
were
humiliated
and
despised
their
civilization
and
renown
spread
throughout
the
world
this
is
perfect
proof
that
muhammad
was
an
educator
and
teacher
in
the
nineteenth
century
strife
and
hostility
prevailed
among
the
people
of
the
orient
apathy
and
ignorance
characterized
the
nations
they
were
indeed
gloomy
and
dark
negligent
of
god
and
under
the
subjection
of
the
baser
instincts
and
passions
of
mankind
the
struggle
for
existence
was
intense
and
universal
at
such
a
time
as
this
bahaullah
appeared
among
them
like
a
luminary
in
the
heavens
he
flooded
the
east
with
light
he
proclaimed
new
principles
and
teachings
he
laid
a
basis
for
new
institutions
which
are
the
very
spirit
of
modernism
the
light
of
the
world
the
development
of
the
body
politic
and
eternal
honor
the
souls
who
hearkened
to
these
teachings
among
the
various
oriental
nations
immediately
renounced
the
spirit
of
strife
and
hostility
and
began
to
associate
in
goodwill
and
fellowship
from
extremes
of
animosity
they
attained
the
acme
of
love
and
brotherhood
they
had
been
warring
and
quarreling
now
they
became
loving
and
lived
together
in
complete
unity
and
agreement
among
them
today
you
will
find
no
religious
political
or
patriotic
prejudice
they
are
friendly
loving
and
associate
in
the
greatest
happiness
they
have
no
part
in
the
war
and
strife
which
take
place
in
the
east
their
attitude
toward
all
men
is
that
of
goodwill
and
lovingkindness
a
standard
of
universal
peace
has
been
unfurled
among
them
the
light
of
guidance
has
flooded
their
souls
it
is
light
upon
light
love
upon
love
this
is
the
education
and
training
of
bahaullah
he
has
led
these
souls
to
this
standard
and
given
them
teachings
which
ensure
eternal
illumination
anyone
who
becomes
well
versed
in
his
teachings
will
say
verily
i
declare
that
these
words
constitute
the
illumination
of
humanity
that
this
is
the
everlasting
honor
that
these
are
heavenly
precepts
and
the
cause
of
neverending
life

men

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
god
is
one
the
effulgence
of
god
is
one
and
humanity
constitutes
the
servants
of
that
one
god
god
is
kind
to
all
he
creates
and
provides
for
all
and
all
are
under
his
care
and
protection
the
sun
of
truth
the
word
of
god
shines
upon
all
mankind
the
divine
cloud
pours
down
its
precious
rain
the
gentle
zephyrs
of
his
mercy
blow
and
all
humanity
is
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
his
eternal
justice
and
lovingkindness
god
has
created
mankind
from
the
same
progeny
in
order
that
they
may
associate
in
good
fellowship
exercise
love
toward
each
other
and
live
together
in
unity
and
brotherhood
but
we
have
acted
contrary
to
the
will
and
good
pleasure
of
god
we
have
been
the
cause
of
enmity
and
disunion
we
have
separated
from
each
other
and
risen
against
each
other
in
opposition
and
strife
how
many
have
been
the
wars
between
peoples
and
nations
what
bloodshed
numberless
are
the
cities
and
homes
which
have
been
laid
waste
all
of
this
has
been
contrary
to
the
good
pleasure
of
god
for
he
hath
willed
love
for
humanity
he
is
clement
and
merciful
to
all
his
creatures
he
hath
ordained
amity
and
fellowship
amongst
men
most
regrettable
of
all
is
the
state
of
difference
and
divergence
we
have
created
between
each
other
in
the
name
of
religion
imagining
that
a
paramount
duty
in
our
religious
belief
is
that
of
alienation
and
estrangement
that
we
should
shun
each
other
and
consider
each
other
contaminated
with
error
and
infidelity
in
reality
the
foundations
of
the
divine
religions
are
one
and
the
same
the
differences
which
have
arisen
between
us
are
due
to
blind
imitations
of
dogmatic
beliefs
and
adherence
to
ancestral
forms
of
worship
abraham
was
the
founder
of
reality
moses
christ
muhammad
were
the
manifestations
of
reality
bahaullah
was
the
glory
of
reality
this
is
not
simply
an
assertion
it
will
be
proved
let
me
ask
your
closest
attention
in
considering
this
subject
the
divine
religions
embody
two
kinds
of
ordinances
first
there
are
those
which
constitute
essential
or
spiritual
teachings
of
the
word
of
god
these
are
faith
in
god
the
acquirement
of
the
virtues
which
characterize
perfect
manhood
praiseworthy
moralities
the
acquisition
of
the
bestowals
and
bounties
emanating
from
the
divine
effulgencesin
brief
the
ordinances
which
concern
the
realm
of
morals
and
ethics
this
is
the
fundamental
aspect
of
the
religion
of
god
and
this
is
of
the
highest
importance
because
knowledge
of
god
is
the
fundamental
requirement
of
man
man
must
comprehend
the
oneness
of
divinity
he
must
come
to
know
and
acknowledge
the
precepts
of
god
and
realize
for
a
certainty
that
the
ethical
development
of
humanity
is
dependent
upon
religion
he
must
get
rid
of
all
defects
and
seek
the
attainment
of
heavenly
virtues
in
order
that
he
may
prove
to
be
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
it
is
recorded
in
the
holy
bible
that
god
said
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
it
is
selfevident
that
the
image
and
likeness
mentioned
do
not
apply
to
the
form
and
semblance
of
a
human
being
because
the
reality
of
divinity
is
not
limited
to
any
form
or
figure
nay
rather
the
attributes
and
characteristics
of
god
are
intended
even
as
god
is
pronounced
to
be
just
man
must
likewise
be
just
as
god
is
loving
and
kind
to
all
men
man
must
likewise
manifest
lovingkindness
to
all
humanity
as
god
is
loyal
and
truthful
man
must
show
forth
the
same
attributes
in
the
human
world
even
as
god
exercises
mercy
toward
all
man
must
prove
himself
to
be
the
manifestation
of
mercy
in
a
word
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
constitute
the
virtues
of
god
and
man
is
intended
to
become
the
recipient
of
the
effulgences
of
divine
attributes
this
is
the
essential
foundation
of
all
the
divine
religions
the
reality
itself
common
to
all
abraham
promulgated
this
moses
proclaimed
it
christ
and
all
the
prophets
upheld
this
standard
and
aspect
of
divine
religion
second
there
are
laws
and
ordinances
which
are
temporary
and
nonessential
these
concern
human
transactions
and
relations
they
are
accidental
and
subject
to
change
according
to
the
exigencies
of
time
and
place
these
ordinances
are
neither
permanent
nor
fundamental
for
instance
during
the
time
of
noah
it
was
expedient
that
seafood
be
considered
as
lawful
therefore
god
commanded
noah
to
partake
of
all
marine
animal
life
during
the
time
of
moses
this
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
exigencies
of
israels
existence
therefore
a
second
command
was
revealed
partly
abrogating
the
law
concerning
marine
foods
during
the
time
of
abrahamupon
him
be
peacecamels
milk
was
considered
a
lawful
and
acceptable
food
likewise
the
flesh
of
the
camel
but
during
jacobs
time
because
of
a
certain
vow
he
made
this
became
unlawful
these
are
nonessential
temporary
laws
in
the
holy
bible
there
are
certain
commandments
which
according
to
those
bygone
times
constituted
the
very
spirit
of
the
age
the
very
light
of
that
period
for
example
according
to
the
law
of
the
torah
if
a
man
committed
theft
of
a
certain
amount
they
cut
off
his
hand
is
it
practicable
and
reasonable
in
this
present
day
to
cut
off
a
mans
hand
for
the
theft
of
a
dollar
in
the
torah
there
are
ten
ordinances
concerning
murder
could
these
be
made
effective
today
unquestionably
no
times
have
changed
according
to
the
explicit
text
of
the
bible
if
a
man
should
change
or
break
the
law
of
the
sabbath
or
if
he
should
touch
fire
on
the
sabbath
he
must
be
killed
today
such
a
law
is
abrogated
the
torah
declares
that
if
a
man
should
speak
a
disrespectful
word
to
his
father
he
should
suffer
the
penalty
of
death
is
this
possible
of
enforcement
now
no
human
conditions
have
undergone
changes
likewise
during
the
time
of
christ
certain
minor
ordinances
conformable
to
that
period
were
enforced
it
has
been
shown
conclusively
therefore
that
the
foundation
of
the
religion
of
god
remains
permanent
and
unchanging
it
is
that
fixed
foundation
which
ensures
the
progress
and
stability
of
the
body
politic
and
the
illumination
of
humanity
it
has
ever
been
the
cause
of
love
and
justice
amongst
men
it
works
for
the
true
fellowship
and
unification
of
all
mankind
for
it
never
changes
and
is
not
subject
to
supersedure
the
accidental
or
nonessential
laws
which
regulate
the
transactions
of
the
social
body
and
everyday
affairs
of
life
are
changeable
and
subject
to
abrogation
let
me
ask
what
is
the
purpose
of
prophethood
why
has
god
sent
the
prophets
it
is
selfevident
that
the
prophets
are
the
educators
of
men
and
the
teachers
of
the
human
race
they
come
to
bestow
universal
education
upon
humanity
to
give
humanity
training
to
uplift
the
human
race
from
the
abyss
of
despair
and
desolation
and
to
enable
man
to
attain
the
apogee
of
advancement
and
glory
the
people
are
in
darkness
the
prophets
bring
them
into
the
realm
of
light
they
are
in
a
state
of
utter
imperfection
the
prophets
imbue
them
with
perfections
the
purpose
of
the
prophetic
mission
is
none
other
than
the
education
and
guidance
of
the
people
therefore
we
must
regard
and
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
man
who
is
thus
qualifiedthat
is
to
say
any
soul
who
proves
to
be
the
educator
of
mankind
and
the
teacher
of
the
human
race
is
undoubtedly
the
prophet
of
his
age
for
example
let
us
review
the
events
connected
with
the
history
of
mosesupon
him
be
peace
he
dwelt
in
midian
at
a
time
when
the
children
of
israel
were
in
captivity
and
bondage
in
the
land
of
egypt
subjected
to
every
tyranny
and
severe
oppression
they
were
illiterate
and
ignorant
undergoing
cruel
ordeals
and
experiences
they
were
in
such
a
state
of
helplessness
and
impotence
that
it
was
proverbial
to
state
that
one
egyptian
could
overcome
ten
israelites
at
such
a
time
as
this
and
under
such
forbidding
conditions
moses
appeared
and
shone
forth
with
a
heavenly
radiance
he
saved
israel
from
the
bondage
of
pharaoh
and
released
them
from
captivity
he
led
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
into
the
holy
land
they
had
been
scattered
and
broken
he
unified
and
disciplined
them
conferred
upon
them
the
blessing
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
they
had
been
slaves
he
made
them
princes
they
were
ignorant
he
made
them
learned
they
were
imperfect
he
enabled
them
to
attain
perfection
in
a
word
he
led
them
out
of
their
condition
of
hopelessness
and
brought
them
to
efficiency
in
the
plane
of
confidence
and
valor
they
became
renowned
throughout
the
ancient
world
until
finally
in
the
zenith
and
splendor
of
their
new
civilization
the
glory
of
the
sovereignty
of
solomon
was
attained
through
the
guidance
and
training
of
moses
these
slaves
and
captives
became
the
dominating
people
amongst
the
nations
not
only
in
physical
and
military
superiority
were
they
renowned
but
in
all
the
degrees
of
arts
letters
and
refinement
their
fame
was
widespread
even
the
celebrated
philosophers
of
greece
journeyed
to
jerusalem
in
order
to
study
with
the
israelitish
sages
and
many
were
the
lessons
of
philosophy
and
wisdom
they
received
among
these
philosophers
was
the
famous
socrates
he
visited
the
holy
land
and
studied
with
the
prophets
of
israel
acquiring
principles
of
their
philosophical
teaching
and
a
knowledge
of
their
advanced
arts
and
sciences
after
his
return
to
greece
he
founded
the
system
known
as
the
unity
of
god
the
greek
people
rose
against
him
and
at
last
he
was
poisoned
in
the
presence
of
the
king
hippocrates
and
many
other
greek
philosophers
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
learned
israelitish
doctors
and
absorbed
their
expositions
of
wisdom
and
inner
truth
inasmuch
as
moses
through
the
influence
of
his
great
mission
was
instrumental
in
releasing
the
israelites
from
a
low
state
of
debasement
and
humiliation
establishing
them
in
a
station
of
prestige
and
glorification
disciplining
and
educating
them
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
reach
a
fair
and
just
judgment
in
regard
to
such
a
marvelous
teacher
for
in
this
great
accomplishment
he
stood
single
and
alone
could
he
have
made
such
a
change
and
brought
about
such
a
condition
among
these
people
without
the
sanction
and
assistance
of
a
heavenly
power
could
he
have
transformed
a
people
from
humiliation
to
glory
without
a
holy
and
divine
support
none
other
than
a
divine
power
could
have
done
this
therein
lies
the
proof
of
prophethood
because
the
mission
of
a
prophet
is
education
of
the
human
race
such
as
this
personage
accomplished
proving
him
to
be
a
mighty
prophet
among
the
prophets
and
his
book
the
very
book
of
god
this
is
a
rational
direct
and
perfect
proof
in
brief
mosesupon
whom
be
peacefounded
the
law
of
god
purified
the
morals
of
the
people
of
israel
and
gave
them
an
impetus
toward
nobler
and
higher
attainments
but
after
the
departure
of
moses
following
the
decline
of
the
glory
of
solomons
era
and
during
the
reign
of
jeroboam
there
came
a
great
change
in
this
nation
the
high
ethical
standards
and
spiritual
perfections
ceased
to
exist
conditions
and
morals
became
corrupt
religion
was
debased
and
the
perfect
principles
of
the
mosaic
law
were
obscured
in
superstition
and
polytheism
war
and
strife
arose
among
the
tribes
and
their
unity
was
destroyed
the
followers
of
jeroboam
declared
themselves
rightful
and
valid
in
kingly
succession
and
the
supporters
of
rehoboam
made
the
same
claim
finally
the
tribes
were
torn
asunder
by
hostility
and
hatred
the
glory
of
israel
was
eclipsed
and
so
complete
was
the
degradation
that
a
golden
calf
was
set
up
as
an
object
of
worship
in
the
city
of
tyre
thereupon
god
sent
elijah
the
prophet
who
redeemed
the
people
renewed
the
law
of
god
and
established
an
era
of
new
life
for
israel
history
shows
a
still
later
change
and
transformation
when
this
oneness
and
solidarity
were
followed
by
another
dispersion
of
the
tribes
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
invaded
the
holy
land
and
carried
away
captive
seventy
thousand
israelites
to
chaldea
where
the
greatest
reverses
trials
and
suffering
afflicted
these
unfortunate
people
then
the
prophets
of
god
again
reformed
and
reestablished
the
law
of
god
and
the
people
in
their
humiliation
again
followed
it
this
resulted
in
their
liberation
and
under
the
edict
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
there
was
a
return
to
the
holy
city
jerusalem
and
the
temple
of
solomon
were
rebuilt
and
the
glory
of
israel
was
restored
this
lasted
but
a
short
time
the
morality
of
the
people
declined
and
conditions
reached
an
extreme
degree
until
the
roman
general
titus
took
jerusalem
and
razed
it
to
its
foundations
pillage
and
conquest
completed
the
desolation
palestine
became
a
waste
and
wilderness
and
the
jews
fled
from
the
holy
land
of
their
ancestors
the
cause
of
this
disintegration
and
dispersion
was
the
departure
of
israel
from
the
foundation
of
the
law
of
god
revealed
by
mosesnamely
the
acquisition
of
divine
virtues
morality
love
the
development
of
arts
and
sciences
and
the
spirit
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
i
now
wish
you
to
examine
certain
facts
and
statements
which
are
worthy
of
consideration
my
purpose
and
intention
is
to
remove
from
the
hearts
of
men
the
religious
enmity
and
hatred
which
have
fettered
them
and
to
bring
all
religions
into
agreement
and
unity
inasmuch
as
this
hatred
and
enmity
this
bigotry
and
intolerance
are
outcomes
of
misunderstandings
the
reality
of
religious
unity
will
appear
when
these
misunderstandings
are
dispelled
for
the
foundation
of
the
divine
religions
is
one
foundation
this
is
the
oneness
of
revelation
or
teaching
but
alas
we
have
turned
away
from
that
foundation
holding
tenaciously
to
various
dogmatic
forms
and
blind
imitation
of
ancestral
beliefs
this
is
the
real
cause
of
enmity
hatred
and
bloodshed
in
the
worldthe
reason
of
alienation
and
estrangement
among
mankind
therefore
i
wish
you
to
be
very
just
and
fair
in
your
judgment
of
the
following
statements
during
the
time
that
the
people
of
israel
were
being
tossed
and
afflicted
by
the
conditions
i
have
named
jesus
christ
appeared
among
them
jesus
of
nazareth
was
a
jew
he
was
single
and
unaided
alone
and
unique
he
had
no
assistant
the
jews
at
once
pronounced
him
to
be
an
enemy
of
moses
they
declared
that
he
was
the
destroyer
of
the
mosaic
laws
and
ordinances
let
us
examine
the
facts
as
they
are
investigate
the
truth
and
reality
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
true
opinion
and
conclusion
for
a
completely
fair
opinion
upon
this
question
we
must
lay
aside
all
we
have
and
investigate
independently
this
personage
jesus
christ
declared
moses
to
have
been
the
prophet
of
god
and
pronounced
all
the
prophets
of
israel
as
sent
from
god
he
proclaimed
the
torah
the
very
book
of
god
summoned
all
to
conform
to
its
precepts
and
follow
its
teachings
it
is
an
historical
fact
that
during
a
period
of
fifteen
hundred
years
the
kings
of
israel
were
unable
to
promulgate
broadcast
the
religion
of
judaism
in
fact
during
that
period
the
name
and
history
of
moses
were
confined
to
the
boundaries
of
palestine
and
the
torah
was
a
book
well
known
only
in
that
country
but
through
christ
through
the
blessing
of
the
new
testament
of
jesus
christ
the
old
testament
the
torah
was
translated
into
six
hundred
different
tongues
and
spread
throughout
the
world
it
was
through
christianity
that
the
torah
reached
persia
before
that
time
there
was
no
knowledge
in
that
country
of
such
a
book
but
christ
caused
its
spread
and
acceptance
through
him
the
name
of
moses
was
elevated
and
revered
he
was
instrumental
in
publishing
the
name
and
greatness
of
the
israelitish
prophets
and
he
proved
to
the
world
that
the
israelites
constituted
the
people
of
god
which
of
the
kings
of
israel
could
have
accomplished
this
were
it
not
for
jesus
christ
would
the
bible
the
torah
have
reached
this
land
of
america
would
the
name
of
moses
be
spread
throughout
the
world
refer
to
history
everyone
knows
that
when
christianity
was
spread
there
was
a
simultaneous
spread
of
the
knowledge
of
judaism
and
the
torah
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
persia
there
was
not
a
single
volume
of
the
old
testament
until
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
caused
it
to
appear
everywhere
so
that
today
the
holy
bible
is
a
household
book
in
that
country
it
is
evident
then
that
christ
was
a
friend
of
moses
that
he
loved
and
believed
in
moses
otherwise
he
would
not
have
commemorated
his
name
and
prophethood
this
is
selfevident
therefore
christians
and
jews
should
have
the
greatest
love
for
each
other
because
the
founders
of
these
two
great
religions
have
been
in
perfect
agreement
in
book
and
teaching
their
followers
should
be
likewise
we
have
already
stated
the
valid
proofs
of
prophethood
we
find
the
very
evidences
of
the
validity
of
moses
were
witnessed
and
duplicated
in
christ
christ
was
also
a
unique
and
single
personage
born
of
the
lineage
of
israel
by
the
power
of
his
word
he
was
able
to
unite
people
of
the
roman
greek
chaldean
egyptian
and
assyrian
nations
whereas
they
had
been
cruel
bloodthirsty
and
hostile
killing
pillaging
and
taking
each
other
captive
he
cemented
them
together
in
a
perfect
bond
of
unity
and
love
he
caused
them
to
agree
and
become
reconciled
such
mighty
effects
were
the
results
of
the
manifestation
of
one
single
soul
this
proves
conclusively
that
christ
was
assisted
by
god
today
all
christians
admit
and
believe
that
moses
was
a
prophet
of
god
they
declare
that
his
book
was
the
book
of
god
that
the
prophets
of
israel
were
true
and
valid
and
that
the
people
of
israel
constituted
the
people
of
god
what
harm
has
come
from
this
what
harm
could
come
from
a
statement
by
the
jews
that
jesus
was
also
a
manifestation
of
the
word
of
god
have
the
christians
suffered
for
their
belief
in
moses
have
they
experienced
any
loss
of
religious
enthusiasm
or
witnessed
any
defeat
in
their
religious
belief
by
declaring
that
moses
was
a
prophet
of
god
that
the
torah
was
a
book
of
god
and
that
all
the
prophets
of
israel
were
prophets
of
god
it
is
evident
that
no
loss
comes
from
this
and
now
it
is
time
for
the
jews
to
declare
that
christ
was
the
word
of
god
and
then
this
enmity
between
two
great
religions
will
pass
away
for
two
thousand
years
this
enmity
and
religious
prejudice
have
continued
blood
has
been
shed
ordeals
have
been
suffered
these
few
words
will
remedy
the
difficulty
and
unite
two
great
religions
what
harm
could
follow
this
that
just
as
the
christians
glorify
and
praise
the
name
of
moses
likewise
the
jews
should
commemorate
the
name
of
christ
declare
him
to
be
the
word
of
god
and
consider
him
as
one
of
the
chosen
messengers
of
god
a
few
words
concerning
the
quran
and
the
muslims
when
muhammad
appeared
he
spoke
of
moses
as
the
great
man
of
god
in
the
quran
he
refers
to
the
sayings
of
moses
in
seven
different
places
proclaims
him
a
prophet
and
the
possessor
of
a
book
the
founder
of
the
law
and
the
spirit
of
god
he
said
whosoever
believes
in
him
is
acceptable
in
the
estimation
of
god
and
whosoever
shuns
him
or
any
of
the
prophets
is
rejected
of
god
even
in
conclusion
he
calls
upon
his
own
relatives
saying
why
have
ye
shunned
and
not
believed
in
moses
why
have
ye
not
acknowledged
the
torah
why
have
ye
not
believed
in
the
jewish
prophets
in
a
certain
surih
of
the
quran
he
mentions
the
names
of
twentyeight
of
the
prophets
of
israel
praising
each
and
all
of
them
to
this
great
extent
he
has
ratified
and
commended
the
prophets
and
religion
of
israel
the
purport
is
this
that
muhammad
praised
and
glorified
moses
and
confirmed
judaism
he
declared
that
whosoever
denies
moses
is
contaminated
and
even
if
he
repents
his
repentance
will
not
be
accepted
he
pronounced
his
own
relatives
infidels
and
impure
because
they
had
denied
the
prophets
he
said
because
you
have
not
believed
in
christ
because
you
have
not
believed
in
moses
because
you
have
not
believed
in
the
gospels
you
are
infidels
and
contaminated
in
this
way
muhammad
has
praised
the
torah
moses
christ
and
the
prophets
of
the
past
he
appeared
amongst
the
arabs
who
were
a
people
nomadic
and
illiterate
barbarous
in
nature
and
bloodthirsty
he
guided
and
trained
them
until
they
attained
a
high
degree
of
development
through
his
education
and
discipline
they
rose
from
the
lowest
levels
of
ignorance
to
the
heights
of
knowledge
becoming
masters
of
erudition
and
philosophy
we
see
therefore
that
the
proofs
applicable
to
one
prophet
are
equally
applicable
to
another
in
conclusion
since
the
prophets
themselves
the
founders
have
loved
praised
and
testified
of
each
other
why
should
we
disagree
and
be
alienated
god
is
one
he
is
the
shepherd
of
all
we
are
his
sheep
and
therefore
should
live
together
in
love
and
unity
we
should
manifest
the
spirit
of
justness
and
goodwill
toward
each
other
shall
we
do
this
or
shall
we
censure
and
pronounce
anathema
praising
ourselves
and
condemning
all
others
what
possible
good
can
come
from
such
attitude
and
action
on
the
contrary
nothing
but
enmity
and
hatred
injustice
and
inhumanity
can
possibly
result
has
not
this
been
the
greatest
cause
of
bloodshed
woe
and
tribulation
in
the
past
praise
be
to
god
you
are
living
in
a
land
of
freedom
you
are
blessed
with
men
of
learning
men
who
are
well
versed
in
the
comparative
study
of
religions
you
realize
the
need
of
unity
and
know
the
great
harm
which
comes
from
prejudice
and
superstition
i
ask
you
is
not
fellowship
and
brotherhood
preferable
to
enmity
and
hatred
in
society
and
community
the
answer
is
selfevident
love
and
fellowship
are
absolutely
needful
to
win
the
good
pleasure
of
god
which
is
the
goal
of
all
human
attainment
we
must
be
united
we
must
love
each
other
we
must
ever
praise
each
other
we
must
bestow
commendation
upon
all
people
thus
removing
the
discord
and
hatred
which
have
caused
alienation
amongst
men
otherwise
the
conditions
of
the
past
will
continue
praising
ourselves
and
condemning
others
religious
wars
will
have
no
end
and
religious
prejudice
the
prime
cause
of
this
havoc
and
tribulation
will
increase
this
must
be
abandoned
and
the
way
to
do
it
is
to
investigate
the
reality
which
underlies
all
the
religions
this
underlying
reality
is
the
love
of
humanity
for
god
is
one
and
humanity
is
one
and
the
only
creed
of
the
prophets
is
love
and
unity

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
the
address
delivered
last
evening
in
the
jewish
synagogue
evidently
disturbed
some
of
the
people
including
the
revered
rabbi
who
called
upon
me
this
afternoon
together
we
went
over
the
ground
again
which
i
shall
now
review
for
your
benefit
it
was
not
possible
to
make
the
subject
completely
plain
to
the
rabbi
last
night
as
he
was
very
much
pressed
for
time
but
today
the
opportunity
was
sufficient
for
a
reconsideration
of
the
statements
in
detail
i
wish
you
to
understand
them
thoroughly
and
memorize
them
in
order
that
you
may
discourse
with
the
jews
and
thus
perchance
become
instrumental
in
leading
them
aright
the
quintessence
of
our
subject
was
this
what
is
the
mission
of
the
prophet
and
what
is
the
object
of
a
divine
law
in
answer
we
stated
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
purpose
of
a
divine
law
is
the
education
of
the
human
race
the
training
of
humanity
all
mankind
may
be
considered
as
pupils
or
children
who
are
in
need
of
a
divine
educator
a
real
teacher
the
essential
requirement
and
qualification
of
prophethood
is
the
training
and
guidance
of
the
people
therefore
we
shall
first
consider
the
efficacy
of
the
teachings
of
those
who
have
been
followed
and
accepted
as
the
prophets
of
god
the
question
that
must
be
answered
is
have
they
taught
mankind
have
they
proved
themselves
efficient
educators
among
them
was
moses
we
find
that
he
appeared
as
the
leader
of
the
children
of
israel
during
a
period
of
their
captivity
they
were
in
a
state
of
extreme
humiliation
ignorance
and
heedlessness
living
in
a
very
lowly
manner
in
egypt
under
conditions
of
life
worse
than
death
imagine
an
ignorant
people
downtrodden
and
oppressed
thoughtless
negligent
and
mentally
darkened
held
in
subjection
as
slaves
moses
was
appointed
for
their
deliverance
and
training
he
guided
them
led
them
out
of
bondage
into
the
holy
land
uplifted
them
from
ignorance
and
despair
trained
them
so
that
they
rose
from
a
condition
of
lowliness
and
subjection
into
one
of
honor
and
importance
and
enabled
them
to
reach
a
high
degree
of
perfection
they
became
proficient
in
sciences
and
arts
attained
a
lofty
plane
of
civilization
honorable
and
esteemed
among
nations
whereas
formerly
they
had
been
lowly
and
despised
they
were
ignorant
they
became
intelligent
finally
reaching
that
period
of
supremacy
and
power
witnessed
in
the
solomonic
sovereignty
their
name
became
widespread
throughout
the
world
and
they
were
esteemed
for
distinct
virtues
even
the
philosophers
of
greece
went
to
palestine
to
drink
from
the
fountains
of
their
wisdom
and
sit
at
the
feet
of
their
sages
all
these
facts
prove
that
moses
was
a
prophet
and
a
teacher
as
to
christ
he
was
a
single
unique
and
lowly
individual
who
appeared
at
a
time
when
the
israelitish
nation
had
fallen
from
the
heights
of
its
glory
to
the
lowest
condition
of
bondage
and
contempt
subject
to
the
tyranny
of
the
roman
empire
living
under
a
yoke
of
humiliation
ignorant
and
negligent
of
god
the
historical
records
of
the
holy
books
confirm
these
statements
christthis
single
and
unique
personageappeared
amongst
these
despised
and
degraded
people
reflecting
a
divine
power
and
the
potency
of
the
holy
spirit
he
unified
the
various
peoples
and
nations
of
the
world
brought
them
together
in
fellowship
and
agreement
and
gathered
them
beneath
the
overshadowing
protection
of
one
word
his
prestige
and
mention
were
not
confined
to
the
children
of
israel
alone
who
were
at
that
time
a
limited
race
and
people
but
his
spiritual
power
had
also
permeated
and
united
great
influential
nations
who
had
been
warlike
and
hostile
such
as
the
romans
greeks
egyptians
chaldeans
syrians
and
assyrians
he
dispelled
their
hostility
healed
their
hatred
made
them
a
united
people
and
by
his
word
created
the
utmost
love
amongst
them
so
that
they
advanced
immeasurably
in
the
degrees
of
education
and
human
perfection
thereby
attaining
a
neverending
glory
the
jews
had
become
dispersed
and
widely
scattered
this
single
and
unique
personage
overcame
all
the
then
known
world
founding
an
everlasting
sovereignty
a
mighty
nation
indeed
such
a
result
proved
him
to
be
a
great
man
the
first
educator
of
his
time
the
first
teacher
of
his
period
what
proofs
could
be
greater
than
these
what
would
be
more
convincing
than
this
evidence
that
a
single
individual
resuscitated
so
many
nations
and
peoples
unified
so
many
tribes
and
sects
removed
so
much
warfare
and
hatred
undoubtedly
such
accomplishment
could
be
wrought
only
through
the
power
of
god
and
not
by
mere
human
effort
which
is
altogether
incapable
of
producing
these
mighty
results
when
christ
appeared
the
jews
pronounced
him
an
enemy
of
moses
pharisaical
rabbis
of
that
age
declared
him
to
be
the
destroyer
of
the
mosaic
law
and
the
institutes
of
the
torah
they
proclaimed
that
he
would
bring
great
misfortune
to
the
people
of
israel
considering
him
the
violator
of
the
holy
sabbath
and
destroyer
of
the
temple
of
solomon
therefore
they
turned
away
from
him
let
us
investigate
this
and
discover
whether
such
accusations
were
true
or
false
we
will
find
that
in
reality
christ
caused
the
name
and
prestige
of
moses
to
become
widespread
through
his
efforts
and
teaching
the
book
of
moses
the
bible
became
known
everywhere
in
fifteen
hundred
years
there
had
been
but
one
translation
of
the
old
testament
the
torah
which
translation
was
made
from
hebrew
into
greek
but
through
the
instrumentality
of
christs
message
and
teachings
it
was
translated
into
six
hundred
tongues
and
spread
to
every
part
of
the
world
all
the
kings
and
prophets
of
israel
were
unable
to
promulgate
the
teachings
of
judaism
and
the
name
of
moses
beyond
the
borders
of
palestine
whereas
through
christ
judaism
became
an
established
religion
in
asia
africa
europe
and
the
world
generally
through
the
message
of
christ
moses
was
everywhere
proclaimed
a
prophet
of
god
and
his
book
the
book
of
god
shall
we
consider
this
personage
an
enemy
or
a
friend
of
moses
justice
is
needed
we
must
render
fair
judgment
upon
this
question
had
he
been
an
enemy
he
would
not
have
allowed
the
name
and
teachings
of
moses
to
become
widespread
in
the
world
he
would
not
have
promulgated
the
law
and
principles
of
the
torah
would
there
have
been
any
mention
of
moses
in
america
could
even
the
name
of
judaism
have
reached
this
part
of
the
world
through
any
other
instrumentality
undoubtedly
it
was
owing
to
the
blessed
agency
and
influence
of
christianity
that
judaism
became
established
in
this
western
world
moses
had
no
better
friend
and
sympathizer
than
christ
consider
how
the
illiterate
among
the
israelites
conceal
the
reality
of
these
facts
and
continue
the
delusion
that
christ
was
an
enemy
of
moses
all
christians
believe
in
moses
they
declare
that
he
was
a
man
of
god
the
interlocutor
and
prophet
of
god
that
his
book
was
the
book
of
god
that
the
people
of
israel
were
the
people
of
god
and
that
all
the
prophets
of
israel
were
valid
and
true
they
offer
unlimited
praise
sincere
eulogy
and
manifest
unlimited
love
for
the
religion
of
moses
what
harm
comes
from
this
and
if
the
jews
should
say
that
christ
was
also
the
word
of
god
the
spirit
of
god
what
harm
could
follow
this
statement
just
these
few
words
would
be
the
cause
of
reconciling
the
christians
and
jews
the
christians
accept
moses
and
his
book
what
harm
have
they
suffered
on
account
of
this
belief
have
they
lost
anything
because
of
it
in
answer
to
all
these
questions
the
rabbi
answered
no
we
continued
what
harm
could
result
if
the
jews
were
in
a
similar
attitude
toward
christianity
declaring
that
christ
was
the
word
of
god
that
the
gospel
is
the
book
of
god
such
an
attitude
as
this
would
cause
the
enmity
of
many
centuries
to
pass
away
if
we
declare
that
moses
was
the
prophet
of
god
and
that
his
book
was
the
law
of
god
does
it
harm
our
religious
standpoint
not
at
all
furthermore
every
nation
is
proud
of
its
great
men
and
heroes
even
though
those
great
ones
may
have
been
atheists
or
agnostics
today
france
glorifies
napoleon
bonaparte
saying
he
was
a
french
military
genius
whereas
in
reality
he
was
a
tyrant
they
say
voltaire
was
ours
although
voltaire
was
an
atheist
rousseau
was
a
great
man
of
this
nation
and
yet
rousseau
was
irreligious
france
is
proud
of
these
great
men
feasts
are
held
commemorating
them
their
names
are
perpetuated
in
special
days
their
memories
treasured
in
prominent
places
and
there
is
music
and
celebration
in
their
honor
the
nation
is
proud
of
them
and
now
do
you
consider
these
great
men
of
france
greater
than
jesus
of
nazareth
it
is
evident
that
in
comparison
with
jesus
christ
they
are
as
nothing
consider
the
grandeur
and
majesty
of
jesus
in
contrast
with
such
men
as
we
have
mentioned
consider
him
from
the
standpoint
of
fame
and
renown
where
is
the
station
of
christ
and
where
is
their
station
what
comparison
is
there
in
reality
christ
is
incomparable
what
harm
then
could
come
from
your
declaration
that
jesus
of
nazareth
was
a
great
man
of
israelitish
birth
and
therefore
we
love
him
that
we
have
given
to
the
world
a
great
man
indeed
that
this
mighty
personage
whose
word
has
spread
throughout
the
world
who
has
conquered
the
east
and
the
west
was
an
israelite
should
you
not
be
proud
of
him
when
you
glorify
and
honor
the
memory
of
christ
rest
assured
that
the
christians
will
take
your
hands
in
real
fellowship
all
difficulty
hesitancy
and
restraint
will
vanish
consider
the
troubles
and
persecutions
heaped
upon
you
in
russia
for
your
fanaticism
of
unbelief
and
you
must
not
think
that
this
is
ended
this
humiliation
will
continue
forever
the
time
may
come
when
in
europe
itself
they
will
arise
against
the
jews
but
your
declaration
that
christ
was
the
word
of
god
will
end
all
such
trouble
my
advice
is
that
in
order
to
become
honorable
protected
and
secure
among
the
nations
of
the
world
in
order
that
the
christians
may
love
and
safeguard
the
israelitish
people
you
should
be
willing
to
announce
your
belief
in
christ
the
word
of
god
this
is
a
complete
statement
there
is
nothing
more
is
it
not
thoughtless
ignorant
prejudice
which
restrains
you
from
doing
so
declare
that
verily
the
word
of
god
was
realized
in
him
and
all
will
be
right
the
rabbi
thoughtfully
said
i
believe
that
what
you
have
said
is
perfectly
true
but
i
must
ask
one
thing
of
you
will
you
not
tell
the
christians
to
love
us
a
little
more
we
replied
we
have
advised
them
and
will
continue
to
do
so

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
every
composition
is
necessarily
subject
to
destruction
or
disintegration
for
instance
this
flower
is
a
composition
of
various
elements
its
decomposition
is
inevitable
when
this
composed
form
undergoes
decompositionin
other
words
when
these
elements
separate
and
disintegratethat
is
what
we
call
the
death
of
the
flower
for
inasmuch
as
it
is
composed
of
single
elements
the
grouping
of
multitudinous
cellular
atoms
it
is
subject
to
disintegration
this
is
the
mortality
of
the
flower
similarly
the
body
of
man
is
composed
of
various
elements
this
composition
of
the
elements
has
been
given
life
when
these
elements
disintegrate
life
disappears
and
that
is
death
existence
in
the
various
planes
or
kingdoms
implies
composition
and
nonexistence
or
death
is
decomposition
but
the
inner
and
essential
reality
of
man
is
not
composed
of
elements
and
therefore
cannot
be
decomposed
it
is
not
an
elemental
composition
subject
to
disintegration
or
death
a
true
and
fundamental
scientific
principle
is
that
an
element
itself
never
dies
and
cannot
be
destroyed
for
the
reason
that
it
is
single
and
not
composed
therefore
it
is
not
subject
to
decomposition
another
evidence
or
proof
of
the
indestructibility
of
the
reality
of
man
is
that
it
is
not
affected
by
the
changes
of
the
physical
body
these
changing
conditions
of
the
bodily
composition
are
definite
and
continual
at
one
time
it
is
normal
at
another
time
abnormal
now
it
is
weak
now
strong
it
suffers
injury
a
hand
may
be
amputated
a
limb
broken
an
eye
destroyed
an
ear
deafened
or
some
defect
appear
in
a
certain
organ
but
these
changes
do
not
affect
the
human
spirit
the
soul
of
man
if
the
body
becomes
stout
or
thin
decrepit
or
strong
the
spirit
or
soul
is
unaffected
thereby
if
a
part
of
the
bodily
organism
be
destroyed
even
if
it
be
dismembered
completely
the
soul
continues
to
function
showing
that
no
changes
of
the
body
affect
its
operation
we
have
seen
that
death
and
mortality
are
synonymous
with
change
and
disintegration
as
we
find
the
soul
unaffected
by
this
change
and
disintegration
of
the
body
we
therefore
prove
it
to
be
immortal
for
that
which
is
changeable
is
accidental
evanescent
furthermore
this
immortal
human
soul
is
endowed
with
two
means
of
perception
one
is
effected
through
instrumentality
the
other
independently
for
instance
the
soul
sees
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
eye
hears
with
the
ear
smells
through
the
nostrils
and
grasps
objects
with
the
hands
these
are
the
actions
or
operations
of
the
soul
through
instruments
but
in
the
world
of
dreams
the
soul
sees
when
the
eyes
are
closed
the
man
is
seemingly
dead
lies
there
as
dead
the
ears
do
not
hear
yet
he
hears
the
body
lies
there
but
hethat
is
the
soultravels
sees
observes
all
the
instruments
of
the
body
are
inactive
all
the
functions
seemingly
useless
notwithstanding
this
there
is
an
immediate
and
vivid
perception
by
the
soul
exhilaration
is
experienced
the
soul
journeys
perceives
senses
it
often
happens
that
a
man
in
a
state
of
wakefulness
has
not
been
able
to
accomplish
the
solution
of
a
problem
and
when
he
goes
to
sleep
he
will
reach
that
solution
in
a
dream
how
often
it
has
happened
that
he
has
dreamed
even
as
the
prophets
have
dreamed
of
the
future
and
events
which
have
thus
been
foreshadowed
have
come
to
pass
literally
therefore
we
learn
that
the
immortality
of
the
soul
or
spirit
is
not
contingent
or
dependent
upon
the
socalled
immortality
of
the
body
because
the
body
in
the
quiescent
state
in
the
time
of
sleep
may
be
as
dead
unconscious
senseless
but
the
soul
or
spirit
is
possessed
of
perceptions
sensations
motion
and
discovery
even
inspiration
and
revelation
are
obtained
by
it
how
many
were
the
prophets
who
have
had
marvelous
visions
of
the
future
while
in
that
state
the
spirit
or
human
soul
is
the
rider
and
the
body
is
only
the
steed
if
anything
affects
the
steed
the
rider
is
not
affected
by
it
the
spirit
may
be
likened
to
the
light
within
the
lantern
the
body
is
simply
the
outer
lantern
if
the
lantern
should
break
the
light
is
ever
the
same
because
the
light
could
shine
even
without
the
lantern
the
spirit
can
conduct
its
affairs
without
the
body
in
the
world
of
dreams
it
is
precisely
as
this
light
without
the
chimney
glass
it
can
shine
without
the
glass
the
human
soul
by
means
of
this
body
can
perform
its
operations
and
without
the
body
it
can
likewise
have
its
control
therefore
if
the
body
be
subject
to
disintegration
the
spirit
is
not
affected
by
these
changes
or
transformations
it
is
an
evident
fact
that
the
body
does
not
conduct
the
process
of
intellection
or
thought
radiation
it
is
only
the
medium
of
the
grossest
sensations
this
human
body
is
purely
animal
in
type
and
like
the
animal
it
is
subject
only
to
the
grosser
sensibilities
it
is
utterly
bereft
of
ideation
or
intellection
utterly
incapable
of
the
processes
of
reason
the
animal
perceives
what
its
eye
sees
and
judges
what
the
ear
hears
it
perceives
according
to
its
animal
senses
the
scent
of
the
nostril
the
taste
of
the
tongue
it
comprehends
not
beyond
its
sense
perceptions
the
animal
is
confined
to
its
feelings
and
sensibilities
a
prisoner
of
the
senses
beyond
these
in
the
finer
higher
processes
of
reasoning
the
animal
cannot
go
for
instance
the
animal
cannot
conceive
of
the
earth
whereon
it
stands
as
a
spherical
object
because
the
spherical
shape
of
the
earth
is
a
matter
of
conscious
reasoning
it
is
not
a
matter
of
sense
perception
an
animal
in
europe
could
not
foresee
and
plan
the
discovery
of
america
as
columbus
did
it
could
not
take
the
globe
map
of
the
earth
and
scan
the
various
continents
saying
this
is
the
eastern
hemisphere
there
must
be
another
the
western
hemisphere
no
animal
could
know
these
things
for
the
reason
that
they
are
referable
to
intellection
the
animal
cannot
become
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
earth
is
revolving
and
the
sun
stationary
only
processes
of
reasoning
can
come
to
this
conclusion
the
outward
eye
sees
the
sun
as
revolving
it
mistakes
the
stars
and
the
planets
as
moving
about
the
earth
but
reason
decides
their
orbit
knows
that
the
earth
is
moving
and
the
other
worlds
fixed
knows
that
the
sun
is
the
solar
center
and
ever
occupies
the
same
place
proves
that
it
is
the
earth
which
revolves
around
it
such
conclusions
are
entirely
intellectual
not
according
to
the
senses
hence
we
know
that
in
the
human
organism
there
is
a
center
of
intellection
a
power
of
intellectual
operation
which
is
the
discoverer
of
the
realities
of
things
this
power
can
unravel
the
mysteries
of
phenomena
it
can
comprehend
that
which
is
knowable
not
alone
the
sensible
all
the
inventions
are
its
products
for
all
of
these
have
been
the
mysteries
of
nature
there
was
a
time
when
the
energy
of
electricity
was
a
mystery
of
nature
but
that
collective
reality
which
is
manifest
in
man
discovered
this
mystery
of
nature
this
latent
force
having
discovered
it
man
brought
it
into
the
plane
of
visibility
all
the
sciences
which
we
now
utilize
are
the
products
of
that
wondrous
reality
but
the
animal
is
deprived
of
its
operations
the
arts
we
now
enjoy
are
the
expressions
of
that
marvelous
reality
the
animal
is
bereft
of
them
because
these
conscious
realities
are
peculiar
to
the
human
spirit
all
the
traces
are
the
outcoming
of
the
perfections
which
comprehend
realities
the
animal
is
bereft
of
these
such
evidences
prove
conclusively
that
man
is
possessed
of
two
realities
as
it
were
a
reality
connected
with
the
senses
which
is
shared
in
common
with
the
animal
and
another
reality
which
is
conscious
and
ideal
in
character
this
latter
is
the
collective
reality
and
the
discoverer
of
mysteries
that
which
discovers
the
realities
of
things
undoubtedly
is
not
of
the
elemental
substances
it
is
distinct
from
them
for
mortality
and
disintegration
are
the
properties
inherent
in
compositions
and
are
referable
to
things
which
are
subject
to
sense
perceptions
but
the
collective
reality
in
man
not
being
so
subject
is
the
discoverer
of
things
therefore
it
is
real
eternal
and
does
not
have
to
undergo
changes
and
transformations
there
are
many
other
proofs
concerning
this
vital
subject
but
i
shall
conclude
with
the
words
of
jesus
christ
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
and
is
acceptable
in
the
kingdom
of
god
this
means
that
just
as
in
the
first
birth
the
fetus
comes
forth
from
the
matrix
of
the
mother
into
the
conditions
of
the
human
kingdom
even
so
the
spirit
of
man
must
be
born
out
of
the
matrix
of
naturalism
out
of
the
baser
nature
in
order
that
he
may
comprehend
the
great
things
of
the
kingdom
of
god
he
must
be
born
out
of
mother
earth
to
find
the
everlasting
life
and
this
collective
reality
or
spirit
of
man
being
born
out
of
the
world
of
nature
possessing
the
attributes
of
god
will
continue
to
live
forever
in
the
eternal
realm

through
the
glad

of

souls
sheltered
beneath
the
overshadowing
power
of
the
kingdom
of
abha
i
see
before
me
an
assemblage
of
souls
who
are
of
the
chosen
and
not
of
the
many
called
and
it
is
my
hope
that
through
the
favors
of
bahaullah
he
may
continue
to
attract
you
to
his
kingdom
and
render
you
victorious
and
triumphant
in
your
service
to
the

of

may
he
assist
all
who
are
firm
in
establishing
the
unity
of
the
inhabitants
of

may
all
of
you
thereby
become
my
partners
and
coadjutors
in
servitude
o
lord
confirm
and
aid
this
assemblage
confirm
these
souls
through
the
breaths
of
thy
holy
spirit
enlighten
the
eyes
by
the
vision
of
these
radiant
lights
and
make
the
ears
joyful
through
the
anthems
of
thy
call
to
service
o
god
verily
we
have
gathered
here
in
the
fragrance
of
thy
love
we
have
turned
to
thy
kingdom
we
seek
naught
save
thee
and
desire
nothing
save
thy
good
pleasure
o
god
let
this
food
be
thy
manna
from
heaven
and
grant
that
this
assemblage
may
be
a
concourse
of
thy
supreme
ones
may
they
be
the
quickening
cause
of
love
to
humanity
and
the
source
of
illumination
to
the
human
race
may
they
be
the
instruments
of
thy
guidance
upon
earth
verily
thou
art
powerful
thou
art
the
bestower
thou
art
the
forgiver
and
thou
art
the
almighty
in
the
world
many
banquets
assemblages
and
meetings
have
been
organized
but
those
gatherings
have
been
commercial
political
educational
or
social
in
their
purpose
and
motive
meetings
are
held
for
the
promotion
of
financial
plans
or
promulgation
of
the
arts
and
sciences
others
have
sought
to
establish
agricultural
industries
or
consummate
territorial
agreements
innumerable
assemblages
have
been
held
for
consultation
upon
subjects
of
learning
and
education
all
such
meetings
have
for
their
object
the
advancement
of
civilization
butpraise
be
to
godthis
banquet
and
this
assemblage
are
for
none
other
purpose
than
love
for
the
purpose
of
announcing
the
divine
kingdom
for
the
manifestation
of
the
ineffable
traces
of
god
for
reflecting
the
effulgences
of
the
kingdom
of
god
for
binding
hearts
together
for
service
to
the
world
of
humanity
for
the
promulgation
of
humanitarian
and
altruistic
realities
for
the
advancement
and
advocating
of
international
peace
for
the
illumination
of
the
whole
world
therefore
such
an
assemblage
is
matchless
and
peerless
because
other
assemblages
are
held
for
a
limited
object
and
personal
motive
whereas
this
meeting
is
for
god
and
god
only
for
his
love
and
purpose
it
is
for
love
of
the
hearts
of
men
and
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
therefore
we
should
offer
thanks
to
god
for
he
has
confirmed
us
in
attaining
to
the
happiness
of
this
occasion
he
has
appointed
us
servants
of
the
human
world
advocates
of
peace
and
unity
among
the
religions
heralds
of
universal
agreement
among
the
races
and
nations
founders
of
divine
reconciliation
among
all
peoples
it
is
my
fond
and
fervent
hope
through
the
favor
of
god
that
this
present
meeting
may
be
instrumental
in
ushering
in
the
day
when
the
standard
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
shall
be
held
aloft
in
america
may
it
be
the
first
real
foundation
of
international
peace
having
for
its
object
universal
service
to
man
may
it
be
divine
philanthropy
without
distinctions
or
differentiations
in
humankind
may
you
consider
all
religions
the
instruments
of
god
and
regard
all
races
as
channels
of
divine
manifestation
may
you
view
mankind
as
the
sheep
of
god
and
know
for
a
certainty
that
he
is
the
real
shepherd
consider
how
this
kind
and
tender
shepherd
cares
for
all
his
flock
how
he
leads
them
in
green
pastures
and
beside
the
still
waters
how
well
he
protects
them
verily
this
shepherd
makes
no
distinctions
whatsoever
to
all
the
sheep
he
is
equally
kind
therefore
we
must
follow
the
example
of
god
and
strive
in
pathways
of
goodwill
toward
all
humanity
may
we
endeavor
with
heart
and
soul
to
reconcile
the
religions
of
the
earth
unify
the
peoples
and
races
and
blend
the
nations
in
a
perfect
solidarity
may
we
uphold
the
flag
of
international
agreement
and
enkindle
a
light
which
shall
illumine
all
regions
with
the
radiance
of
oneness
may
our
purposes
centralize
in
the
earnest
desire
of
attaining
the
good
pleasure
of
god
and
may
our
supreme
energies
be
directed
to
welding
together
the
human
household
let
us
not
regard
our
own
respective
capacities
nay
rather
let
us
regard
forever
the
favors
and
bounties
of
god
the
drop
must
not
estimate
its
own
limited
capacity
it
must
realize
the
volume
and
sufficiency
of
the
ocean
which
ever
glorifieth
the
drop
the
tender
and
simple
seed
solitary
though
it
may
be
must
not
look
upon
its
own
lack
of
power
nay
rather
its
attention
must
ever
be
directed
to
the
sun
in
the
rays
of
which
it
finds
life
and
quickening
and
it
must
ever
consider
the
downpour
of
the
cloud
of
mercy
for
the
bounty
of
the
cloud
the
effulgence
and
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
breath
of
the
vernal
zephyrs
can
transform
the
tiny
seed
and
develop
it
into
a
mighty
tree
and
may
you
remember
that
a
single
infinitesimal
atom
in
the
ray
of
the
sun
through
a
shining
beam
of
the
solar
energy
becomes
glorified
and
radiant
therefore
let
us
ever
trust
in
god
and
seek
confirmation
and
assistance
from
him
let
us
have
perfect
and
absolute
confidence
in
the
bounty
of
the
kingdom
review
the
events
surrounding
souls
of
bygone
times
in
the
beginning
of
their
day
and
again
consider
them
when
through
the
aid
and
assistance
of
god
they
proved
to
be
the
mighty
ones
of
god
remember
that
peter
was
a
fisherman
but
through
the
bounty
of
the
kingdom
he
became
the
great
apostle
mary
magdalene
was
a
villager
of
lowly
type
yet
that
selfsame
mary
was
transformed
and
became
the
means
through
which
the
confirmation
of
god
descended
upon
the
disciples
verily
she
served
the
kingdom
of
god
with
such
efficiency
that
she
became
wellknown
and
oft
mentioned
by
the
tongues
of
men
even
today
she
is
shining
from
the
horizon
of
eternal
majesty
consider
how
infinite
is
the
bounty
of
god
that
a
woman
such
as
mary
magdalene
should
be
selected
by
god
to
become
the
channel
of
confirmation
to
the
disciples
and
a
light
of
nearness
in
his
kingdom
consequently
trust
ye
in
the
bounty
and
grace
of
god
and
rest
assured
in
the
bestowals
of
his
eternal
outpouring
i
hope
that
each
one
of
you
may
become
a
shining
light
even
as
these
electric
lights
are
now
brilliant
in
their
intensity
nay
may
each
one
of
you
be
a
luminary
like
unto
a
sparkling
star
in
the
heaven
of
the
divine
will
this
is
my
supplication
at
the
throne
of
god
this
is
my
hope
through
the
favors
of
bahaullah
i
offer
this
prayer
in
behalf
of
all
of
you
and
beg
with
a
contrite
heart
that
you
may
be
assisted
and
glorified
with
an
eternal
bestowal

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
what
is
the
reality
of
divinity
or
what
do
we
understand
by
god
when
we
consider
the
world
of
existence
we
find
that
the
essential
reality
underlying
any
given
phenomenon
is
unknown
phenomenal
or
created
things
are
known
to
us
only
by
their
attributes
man
discerns
only
manifestations
or
attributes
of
objects
while
the
identity
or
reality
of
them
remains
hidden
for
example
we
call
this
object
a
flower
what
do
we
understand
by
this
name
and
title
we
understand
that
the
qualities
appertaining
to
this
organism
are
perceptible
to
us
but
the
intrinsic
elemental
reality
or
identity
of
it
remains
unknown
its
external
appearance
and
manifest
attributes
are
knowable
but
the
inner
being
the
underlying
reality
or
intrinsic
identity
is
still
beyond
the
ken
and
perception
of
our
human
powers
inasmuch
as
the
realities
of
material
phenomena
are
impenetrable
and
unknowable
and
are
only
apprehended
through
their
properties
or
qualities
how
much
more
this
is
true
concerning
the
reality
of
divinity
that
holy
essential
reality
which
transcends
the
plane
and
grasp
of
mind
and
man
that
which
comes
within
human
grasp
is
finite
and
in
relation
to
it
we
are
infinite
because
we
can
grasp
it
assuredly
the
finite
is
lesser
than
the
infinite
the
infinite
is
ever
greater
if
the
reality
of
divinity
could
be
contained
within
the
grasp
of
human
mind
it
would
after
all
be
possessed
of
an
intellectual
existence
onlya
mere
intellectual
concept
without
extraneous
existence
an
image
or
likeness
which
had
come
within
the
comprehension
of
finite
intellect
the
mind
of
man
would
be
transcendental
thereto
how
could
it
be
possible
that
an
image
which
has
only
intellectual
existence
is
the
reality
of
divinity
which
is
infinite
therefore
the
reality
of
divinity
in
its
identity
is
beyond
the
range
of
human
intellection
because
the
human
mind
the
human
intellect
the
human
thought
are
limited
whereas
the
reality
of
divinity
is
unlimited
how
can
the
limited
grasp
the
unlimited
and
transcend
it
impossible
the
unlimited
always
comprehends
the
limited
the
limited
can
never
comprehend
surround
nor
take
in
the
unlimited
therefore
every
concept
of
divinity
which
has
come
within
the
intellection
of
a
human
being
is
finite
or
limited
and
is
a
pure
product
of
imagination
whereas
the
reality
of
divinity
is
holy
and
sacred
above
and
beyond
all
such
concepts
but
the
question
may
be
asked
how
shall
we
know
god
we
know
him
by
his
attributes
we
know
him
by
his
signs
we
know
him
by
his
names
we
know
not
what
the
reality
of
the
sun
is
but
we
know
the
sun
by
the
ray
by
the
heat
by
its
efficacy
and
penetration
we
recognize
the
sun
by
its
bounty
and
effulgence
but
as
to
what
constitutes
the
reality
of
the
solar
energy
that
is
unknowable
to
us
the
attributes
characterizing
the
sun
however
are
knowable
if
we
wish
to
come
in
touch
with
the
reality
of
divinity
we
do
so
by
recognizing
its
phenomena
its
attributes
and
traces
which
are
widespread
in
the
universe
all
things
in
the
world
of
phenomena
are
expressive
of
that
one
reality
its
lights
are
shining
its
heat
is
manifest
its
power
is
expressive
and
its
education
or
training
resplendent
everywhere
what
proof
could
there
be
greater
than
that
of
its
functioning
or
its
attributes
which
are
manifest
this
plant
or
this
flowerwe
ask
does
it
exist
or
not
can
this
plantthis
flowercomprehend
the
reality
of
man
can
it
put
itself
in
touch
with
the
human
existence
or
reality
evidently
not
it
is
entirely
out
of
tune
with
the
human
kingdom
it
is
not
possessed
of
the
capacity
although
both
man
and
the
flower
have
been
created
but
the
difference
in
the
degrees
between
the
vegetable
and
the
human
is
ever
a
hindrance
an
obstacle
inasmuch
as
the
degree
of
capacity
appertaining
to
this
plant
is
inferior
to
our
human
kingdom
it
is
entirely
impossible
for
the
plant
which
is
inferior
to
comprehend
man
who
is
superior
although
both
are
accidental
or
created
we
are
created
likewise
this
plant
is
existent
this
mineral
exists
this
wood
exists
but
can
this
flooring
here
comprehend
those
who
are
standing
upon
it
it
cannot
because
sight
and
hearing
are
properties
or
faculties
belonging
to
a
higher
kingdom
than
the
mineral
the
difference
between
these
two
kingdoms
the
vast
difference
between
the
mineral
kingdom
and
the
human
kingdom
is
a
hindrance
to
comprehension
how
then
can
the
reality
of
man
which
is
accidental
ever
comprehend
the
reality
of
god
which
is
eternal
it
is
selfevidently
an
impossibility
hence
we
can
observe
the
traces
and
attributes
of
god
which
are
resplendent
in
all
phenomena
and
shining
as
the
sun
at
midday
and
know
surely
that
these
emanate
from
an
infinite
source
we
know
that
they
come
from
a
source
which
is
infinite
indeed
furthermore
it
is
a
philosophical
principle
that
the
existence
of
phenomena
implies
composition
and
that
mortality
or
nonexistence
is
equivalent
to
decomposition
for
example
certain
elements
have
come
together
and
as
a
result
of
that
composition
man
is
here
certain
elements
have
entered
into
the
structure
of
this
flower
certain
organic
or
cellular
elements
have
been
utilized
in
the
composition
of
every
animal
organism
therefore
we
can
state
that
existence
necessitates
composition
and
death
is
another
expression
for
decomposition
when
there
is
disintegration
amongst
these
composing
elements
that
is
death
that
is
mortality
the
elements
which
have
gone
into
the
body
of
this
flower
and
which
have
given
existence
to
this
form
and
shape
will
finally
disintegrate
this
beautiful
organism
will
decompose
and
this
we
call
mortality
death
consequently
the
conclusion
is
that
life
means
composition
and
death
is
equivalent
to
decomposition
on
this
account
the
materialists
are
of
the
opinion
that
life
is
the
mere
conjoining
of
elemental
substances
into
myriad
forms
and
shapes
the
materialist
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
life
in
other
words
means
composition
that
wherever
we
find
single
elements
combined
in
aggregate
form
there
we
behold
the
phenomena
of
organic
life
that
every
organic
composition
is
organic
life
now
if
life
means
composition
of
elements
then
the
materialist
may
come
to
the
conclusion
of
the
nonnecessity
of
a
composer
the
nonnecessity
of
a
creator
for
composition
is
all
there
is
to
it
and
that
is
accomplished
by
adhesion
or
cohesion
in
response
to
this
we
say
that
composition
must
needs
be
of
three
kinds
one
form
of
composition
is
termed
philosophically
the
accidental
another
the
involuntary
and
a
third
the
voluntary
as
to
the
first
or
accidental
composition
this
would
signify
that
certain
elements
through
inherent
qualities
and
powers
of
attraction
or
affinity
have
been
gathered
together
have
blended
and
so
composed
a
certain
form
being
or
organism
this
can
be
proven
to
be
false
for
composition
is
an
effect
and
philosophically
no
effect
is
conceivable
without
causation
no
effect
can
be
conceived
of
without
some
primal
cause
for
example
this
heat
is
an
effect
but
that
energy
which
gives
forth
this
phenomenon
of
heat
is
the
cause
this
light
is
an
effect
but
back
of
it
is
the
energy
which
is
the
cause
is
it
possible
for
this
light
to
be
separated
from
the
energy
whereof
it
is
a
property
that
is
impossible
and
inconceivable
it
is
selfevidently
false
accidental
composition
is
therefore
a
false
theory
and
may
be
excluded
as
to
the
second
form
of
compositioninvoluntary
this
means
that
each
element
has
within
itself
as
an
inherent
property
the
power
of
composition
for
example
the
inherent
quality
of
fire
is
burning
or
heat
heat
is
a
property
of
fire
humidity
is
the
inherent
nature
or
property
of
water
you
cannot
conceive
ho
which
is
the
chemical
form
of
water
without
having
humidity
associated
for
that
is
an
inherent
quality
of
water
the
power
of
attraction
has
as
its
function
attractive
or
magnetic
qualities
we
cannot
separate
attraction
from
that
power
the
power
of
repulsion
has
as
its
function
repellingsending
off
you
cannot
separate
the
effect
from
the
cause
if
these
premises
be
trueand
they
are
selfevidentthen
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
composite
being
for
the
elements
which
have
gone
into
the
makeup
of
a
composite
organism
ever
to
be
decomposed
because
the
inherent
nature
of
each
element
would
be
to
hold
fast
together
as
fire
cannot
be
separated
from
heat
likewise
the
elemental
being
could
not
be
subjected
to
decomposition
and
this
does
not
hold
true
because
we
see
decomposition
everywhere
hence
this
theory
is
untrue
inasmuch
as
we
observe
that
after
each
composition
there
is
a
process
of
decomposition
which
forever
ends
it
by
this
we
learn
that
composition
as
regards
phenomena
is
neither
accidental
nor
involuntary
then
what
have
we
left
as
a
form
of
composition
it
is
the
voluntary
form
of
composition
which
means
that
composition
is
effected
through
a
superior
will
that
there
is
will
expressed
in
this
motive
or
action
it
is
thus
proved
that
the
existence
of
phenomena
is
effected
through
the
eternal
will
the
will
of
the
living
eternal
and
selfsubsistent
and
this
is
a
rational
proof
concerning
composition
whereof
there
is
no
doubt
or
uncertainty
furthermore
it
is
quite
evident
that
our
kind
of
life
our
form
of
existence
is
limited
and
that
the
reality
of
all
accidental
phenomena
is
likewise
limited
the
very
fact
that
the
reality
of
phenomena
is
limited
well
indicates
that
there
must
needs
be
an
unlimited
reality
for
were
there
no
unlimited
or
infinite
reality
in
life
the
finite
being
of
objects
would
be
inconceivable
to
make
it
plainer
for
you
if
there
were
no
wealth
in
the
world
you
would
not
have
poverty
if
there
were
no
light
in
the
world
you
could
not
conceive
of
darkness
for
we
know
things
philosophically
by
their
antitheses
we
know
for
example
that
poverty
is
the
lack
of
wealth
where
there
is
no
knowledge
there
is
no
ignorance
what
is
ignorance
it
is
the
absence
of
knowledge
therefore
our
limited
existence
is
a
conclusive
proof
that
there
is
an
unlimited
reality
and
this
is
a
shining
proof
and
evident
argument
many
are
the
proofs
concerning
this
matter
but
there
is
not
time
to
go
into
the
subject
further
this
is
our
last
evening
and
i
ask
god
that
his
confirmations
may
encompass
you
that
your
hearts
may
become
radiant
that
your
eyes
become
illumined
through
witnessing
the
signs
of
god
that
your
ears
hearken
to
the
anthems
of
heaven
that
your
faces
be
set
aglow
with
the
radiant
light
of
the
word
of
god
may
you
all
be
united
may
you
be
agreed
may
you
serve
the
solidarity
of
mankind
may
you
be
wellwishers
of
all
humanity
may
you
be
assistants
of
every
poor
one
may
you
be
nurses
for
the
sick
may
you
be
sources
of
comfort
to
the
broken
in
heart
may
you
be
a
refuge
for
the
wanderer
may
you
be
a
source
of
courage
to
the
affrighted
one
thus
through
the
favor
and
assistance
of
god
may
the
standard
of
the
happiness
of
humanity
be
held
aloft
in
the
center
of
the

and

this
is
a
beautiful
assembly
i
am
very
happy
that
white
and
black
are
together
this
is
the
cause
of
my
happiness
for
you
all
are
the
servants
of
one
god
and
therefore
brothers
sisters
mothers
and
fathers
in
the
sight
of
god
there
is
no
distinction
between
whites
and
blacks
all
are
as
one
anyone
whose
heart
is
pure
is
dear
to
godwhether
white
or
black
red
or
yellow
among
the
animals
colors
exist
the
doves
are
white
black
red
blue
but
notwithstanding
this
diversity
of
color
they
flock
together
in
unity
happiness
and
fellowship
making
no
distinction
among
themselves
for
they
are
all
doves
man
is
intelligent
and
thoughtful
endowed
with
powers
of
mind
why
then
should
he
be
influenced
by
distinction
of
color
or
race
since
all
belong
to
one
human
family
there
is
no
sheep
which
shuns
another
as
if
saying
i
am
white
and
you
are
black
they
graze
together
in
complete
unity
live
together
in
fellowship
and
happiness
how
then
can
man
be
limited
and
influenced
by
racial
colors
the
important
thing
is
to
realize
that
all
are
human
all
are
one
progeny
of
adam
inasmuch
as
they
are
all
one
family
why
should
they
be
separated
i
had
a
servant
who
was
black
his
name
was
isfandiyar
if
a
perfect
man
could
be
found
in
the
world
that
man
was
isfandiyar
he
was
the
essence
of
love
radiant
with
sanctity
and
perfection
luminous
with
light
whenever
i
think
of
isfandiyar
i
am
moved
to
tears
although
he
passed
away
fifty
years
ago
he
was
the
faithful
servant
of
bahaullah
and
was
entrusted
with
his
secrets
for
this
reason
the
shah
of
persia
wanted
him
and
inquired
continually
as
to
his
whereabouts
bahaullah
was
in
prison
but
the
shah
had
commanded
many
persons
to
find
isfandiyar
perhaps
more
than
one
hundred
officers
were
appointed
to
search
for
him
if
they
had
succeeded
in
catching
him
they
would
not
have
killed
him
at
once
they
would
have
cut
his
flesh
into
pieces
to
force
him
to
tell
them
the
secrets
of
bahaullah
but
isfandiyar
with
the
utmost
dignity
used
to
walk
in
the
streets
and
bazaars
one
day
he
came
to
us
my
mother
my
sister
and
myself
lived
in
a
house
near
a
corner
because
our
enemies
frequently
injured
us
we
were
intending
to
go
to
a
place
where
they
did
not
know
us
i
was
a
child
at
that
time
at
midnight
isfandiyar
came
in
my
mother
said
o
isfandiyar
there
are
a
hundred
policemen
seeking
for
you
if
they
catch
you
they
will
not
kill
you
at
once
but
will
torture
you
with
fire
they
will
cut
off
your
fingers
they
will
cut
off
your
ears
they
will
put
out
your
eyes
to
force
you
to
tell
them
the
secrets
of
bahaullah
go
away
do
not
stay
here
he
said
i
cannot
go
because
i
owe
money
in
the
street
and
in
the
stores
how
can
i
go
they
will
say
that
the
servant
of
bahaullah
has
bought
and
consumed
the
goods
and
supplies
of
the
storekeepers
without
paying
for
them
unless
i
pay
all
these
obligations
i
cannot
go
but
if
they
take
me
never
mind
if
they
punish
me
there
is
no
harm
in
that
if
they
kill
me
do
not
be
grieved
but
to
go
away
is
impossible
i
must
remain
until
i
pay
all
i
owe
then
i
will
go
for
one
month
isfandiyar
went
about
in
the
streets
and
bazaars
he
had
things
to
sell
and
from
his
earnings
he
gradually
paid
his
creditors
in
fact
they
were
not
his
debts
but
the
debts
of
the
court
for
all
our
properties
had
been
confiscated
everything
we
had
was
taken
away
from
us
the
only
things
that
remained
were
our
debts
isfandiyar
paid
them
in
full
not
a
single
penny
remained
unpaid
then
he
came
to
us
said
goodbye
and
went
away
afterward
bahaullah
was
released
from
prison
we
went
to
baghdad
and
isfandiyar
came
there
he
wanted
to
stay
in
the
same
home
bahaullah
the
blessed
perfection
said
to
him
when
you
fled
away
there
was
a
persian
minister
who
gave
you
shelter
at
a
time
when
no
one
else
could
give
you
protection
because
he
gave
you
shelter
and
protected
you
you
must
be
faithful
to
him
if
he
is
satisfied
to
have
you
go
then
come
to
us
but
if
he
does
not
want
you
to
go
do
not
leave
him
his
master
said
i
do
not
want
to
be
separated
from
isfandiyar
where
can
i
find
another
like
him
with
such
sincerity
such
faithfulness
such
character
such
power
where
can
i
find
one
o
isfandiyar
i
am
not
willing
that
you
should
go
yet
if
you
wish
to
go
let
it
be
according
to
your
own
will
but
because
the
blessed
perfection
had
said
you
must
be
faithful
isfandiyar
stayed
with
his
master
until
he
died
he
was
a
point
of
light
although
his
color
was
black
yet
his
character
was
luminous
his
mind
was
luminous
his
face
was
luminous
truly
he
was
a
point
of
light
then
it
is
evident
that
excellence
does
not
depend
upon
color
character
is
the
true
criterion
of
humanity
anyone
who
possesses
a
good
character
who
has
faith
in
god
and
is
firm
whose
actions
are
good
whose
speech
is
goodthat
one
is
accepted
at
the
threshold
of
god
no
matter
what
color
he
may
be
in
shortpraise
be
to
godyou
are
the
servants
of
god
the
love
of
bahaullah
is
in
your
hearts
your
souls
are
rejoicing
in
the
glad
tidings
of
bahaullah
my
hope
is
that
the
white
and
the
black
will
be
united
in
perfect
love
and
fellowship
with
complete
unity
and
brotherhood
associate
with
each
other
think
of
each
other
and
be
like
a
rose
garden
anyone
who
goes
into
a
rose
garden
will
see
various
roses
white
pink
yellow
red
all
growing
together
and
replete
with
adornment
each
one
accentuates
the
beauty
of
the
other
were
all
of
one
color
the
garden
would
be
monotonous
to
the
eye
if
they
were
all
white
or
yellow
or
red
the
garden
would
lack
variety
and
attractiveness
but
when
the
colors
are
varied
white
pink
yellow
red
there
will
be
the
greatest
beauty
therefore
i
hope
that
you
will
be
like
a
rose
garden
although
different
in
colors
yetpraise
be
to
godyou
receive
rays
from
the
same
sun
from
one
cloud
the
rain
is
poured
upon
you
you
are
under
the
training
of
one
gardener
and
this
gardener
is
kind
to
all
therefore
you
must
manifest
the
utmost
kindness
towards
each
other
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
whenever
you
are
united
the
confirmations
of
the
kingdom
of
abha
will
reach
you
the
heavenly
favors
will
descend
the
bounties
of
god
will
be
bestowed
the
sun
of
reality
will
shine
the
cloud
of
mercy
will
pour
its
showers
and
the
breeze
of
divine
generosity
will
waft

notes
by
joseph
h
hannen
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
the
friends
in
washington
and
experience
real
happiness
in
meeting
them
likewise
i
am
pleased
with
the
friends
from
baltimore
for
i
have
observed
that
their
hearts
are
attracted
to
the
love
of
bahaullah
their
vision
is
extended
toward
the
kingdom
of
baha
their
spirits
are
rejoicing
in
the
glad
tidings
of
abha
verily
they
are
servants
of
the
cause
of
god
all
are
engaged
in
service
and
the
perfection
of
their
desire
is
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
abha
and
draw
near
unto
god
for
that
reason
i
am
very
happy
and
well
pleased
with
them
i
pray
for
you
all
may
the
favors
of
the
blessed
beauty
bahaullah
encompass
you
and
may
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
reality
be
your
illumination
may
you
all
become
united
and
assured
may
you
serve
the
cause
of
god
as
one
single
united
force
i
give
you
the
glad
tidings
that
the
confirmations
of
god
will
descend
upon
you
be
ye
assured
of
this
ye
will
become
illumined
ye
will
become
conquerors
but
after
i
leave
some
people
may
arise
in
opposition
heaping
persecutions
upon
you
in
their
bitterness
and
in
the
newspapers
there
may
be
articles
published
against
the
cause
rest
ye
in
the
assurance
of
firmness
be
well
poised
and
serene
remembering
that
this
is
only
as
the
harmless
twittering
of
sparrows
and
that
it
will
soon
pass
away
if
such
things
do
not
happen
the
fame
of
the
cause
will
not
become
widespread
and
the
summons
of
god
will
not
be
heard
consider
the
history
of
the
past
recall
for
instance
the
days
of
christ
and
the
events
subsequent
thereto
how
many
were
the
books
written
against
him
what
calumnies
were
attributed
to
him
how
violent
were
the
utterances
in
the
temples
against
him
how
many
the
accusations
what
hatred
and
persecution
how
they
scoffed
at
him
in
derision
and
contempt
consider
the
titles
and
epithets
they
bestowed
upon
his
majesty
they
even
designated
him
beelzebubsatan
they
said
beelzebub
had
been
captured
and
crucified
they
placed
a
crown
of
thorns
upon
beelzebubs
head
and
paraded
him
through
the
streets
this
was
the
name
the
jews
bestowed
upon
christ
it
is
written
in
the
gospel
there
were
many
other
forms
of
reviling
and
persecution
spitting
in
his
beautiful
face
cursing
and
anathematizing
bowing
backward
toward
him
saying
peace
be
on
thee
thou
king
of
the
jews
peace
be
on
thee
thou
destroyer
of
the
temple
peace
be
on
thee
thou
king
and
pretender
who
would
restore
the
temple
in
three
days
the
philosophers
of
the
times
romans
and
greeks
wrote
against
christ
even
the
kings
wrote
books
of
abuse
calumny
and
contempt
one
of
these
kings
was
a
caesar
he
was
also
a
philosopher
in
his
book
he
says
concerning
the
people
of
christ
the
most
degraded
of
people
are
the
christians
the
most
immoral
of
the
people
of
this
time
are
the
christians
jesus
of
nazareth
has
led
them
astray
o
people
if
you
wish
to
know
who
jesus
is
and
what
christian
means
go
and
ask
his
relatives
go
and
ask
the
jews
who
know
him
see
what
a
bad
person
he
is
how
degraded
he
is
there
were
many
similar
accounts
but
remember
that
these
statements
did
not
affect
the
cause
of
christianity
on
the
contrary
christianity
advanced
daily
in
power
and
potency
day
by
day
the
majesty
of
christ
grew
in
splendor
and
effulgence
therefore
my
purpose
is
to
warn
and
strengthen
you
against
accusations
criticisms
revilings
and
derision
in
newspaper
articles
or
other
publications
be
not
disturbed
by
them
they
are
the
very
confirmation
of
the
cause
the
very
source
of
upbuilding
to
the
movement
may
god
confirm
the
day
when
a
score
of
ministers
of
the
churches
may
arise
and
with
bared
heads
cry
at
the
top
of
their
voices
that
the
bahais
are
misguided
i
would
like
to
see
that
day
for
that
is
the
time
when
the
cause
of
god
will
spread
bahaullah
has
pronounced
such
as
these
the
couriers
of
the
cause
they
will
proclaim
from
pulpits
that
the
bahais
are
fools
that
they
are
a
wicked
and
unrighteous
people
but
be
ye
steadfast
and
unwavering
in
the
cause
of
god
they
will
spread
the
message
of
bahaullah
his
honor
mirza

has
written
a
treatise
answering
the
criticisms
of
a
london

each
one
of
you
should
have
a
copy
read
memorize
and
reflect
upon
it
then
when
accusations
and
criticisms
are
advanced
by

the

notes
by
hooper
harris
i
have
spoken
in
the
various
christian
churches
and
in
the
synagogues
and
in
no
assemblage
has
there
been
a
dissenting
voice
all
have
listened
and
all
have
conceded
that
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
are
superlative
in
character
acknowledging
that
they
constitute
the
very
essence
or
spirit
of
this
new
age
and
that
there
is
no
better
pathway
to
the
attainment
of
its
ideals
not
a
single
voice
has
been
raised
in
objection
at
most
there
have
been
some
who
have
refused
to
acknowledge
the
mission
of
bahaullah
although
even
these
have
admitted
that
he
was
a
great
teacher
a
most
powerful
soul
a
very
great
man
some
who
could
find
no
other
pretext
have
said
these
teachings
are
not
new
they
are
old
and
familiar
we
have
heard
them
before
therefore
i
will
speak
to
you
upon
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
the
manifestation
of
bahaullah
and
prove
that
from
every
standpoint
his
cause
is
distinguished
from
all
others
it
is
distinguished
by
its
didactic
character
and
method
of
exposition
by
its
practical
effects
and
application
to
present
world
conditions
but
especially
distinguished
from
the
standpoint
of
its
spread
and
progress
when
bahaullah
appeared
in
persia
all
the
contemporaneous
religious
sects
and
systems
rose
against
him
his
enemies
were
kings
the
enemies
of
christ
were
the
jews
the
pharisees
but
the
enemies
of
bahaullah
were
rulers
who
could
command
armies
and
bring
hundreds
of
thousands
of
soldiers
into
the
arena
of
operation
these
kings
represented
some
fifty
million
people
all
of
whom
under
their
influence
and
domination
were
opposed
to
bahaullah
therefore
in
effect
bahaullah
singly
and
alone
virtually
withstood
fifty
million
enemies
yet
these
great
numbers
instead
of
being
able
to
dominate
him
could
not
withstand
his
wonderful
personality
and
the
power
and
influence
of
his
heavenly
cause
although
they
were
determined
upon
extinguishing
the
light
in
that
most
brilliant
lantern
they
were
ultimately
defeated
and
overthrown
and
day
by
day
his
splendor
became
more
radiant
they
made
every
effort
to
lessen
his
greatness
but
his
prestige
and
renown
grew
in
proportion
to
their
endeavors
to
diminish
it
surrounded
by
enemies
who
were
seeking
his
life
he
never
sought
to
conceal
himself
did
nothing
to
protect
himself
on
the
contrary
in
his
spiritual
might
and
power
he
was
at
all
times
visible
before
the
faces
of
men
easy
of
access
serenely
withstanding
the
multitudes
who
were
opposing
him
at
last
his
banner
was
upraised
if
we
study
historical
record
and
review
the
pages
of
holy
writ
we
will
find
that
none
of
the
prophets
of
the
past
ever
spread
his
teachings
or
promulgated
his
cause
from
a
prison
but
bahaullah
upheld
the
banner
of
the
cause
of
god
while
he
was
in
a
dungeon
addressing
the
kings
of
the
earth
from
his
prison
cell
severely
arraigning
them
for
their
oppression
of
their
subjects
and
their
misuse
of
power
the
letter
he
sent
to
the
shah
of
persia
under
such
conditions
may
now
be
read
by
anyone
his
epistles
to
the
sultan
of
turkey
napoleon
iii
emperor
of
france
and
to
the
other
rulers
of
the
world
including
the
president
of
the
united
states
are
likewise
current
and
available
the
book
containing
these
epistles
to
the
kings
was
published
in
india
about
thirty
years
ago
and
is
known
as
the
suratulhaykal
discourse
of
the
temple
whatever
is
recorded
in
these
epistles
has
happened
some
of
the
prophecies
contained
in
them
came
to
pass
after
two
years
others
were
fulfilled
after
five
ten
and
twenty
years
the
most
important
prophecies
relative
to
events
transpiring
in
the
balkans
are
being
fulfilled
at
the
present
time
though
written
long
ago
for
instance
in
the
epistle
which
bahaullah
addressed
to
the
sultan
of
turkey
the
war
and
the
occurrences
of
the
present
day
were
foretold
by
him
these
events
were
also
prophesied
in
the
tablet
he
addressed
to
the
city
of
constantinople
even
to
the
details
of
happenings
now
being
witnessed
in
that
city
while
addressing
these
powerful
kings
and
rulers
he
was
a
prisoner
in
a
turkish
dungeon
consider
how
marvelous
it
was
for
a
prisoner
under
the
eye
and
control
of
the
turks
to
arraign
so
boldly
and
severely
the
very
king
who
was
responsible
for
his
imprisonment
what
power
this
is
what
greatness
nowhere
in
history
can
the
record
of
such
a
happening
be
found
in
spite
of
the
iron
rule
and
absolute
dominion
of
these
kings
his
function
was
to
withstand
them
and
so
constant
and
firm
was
he
that
he
caused
their
banners
to
come
down
and
his
own
standard
to
be
upraised
for
today
the
flags
of
both
the
persian
and
the
ottoman
empires
are
trailing
in
the
dust
whereas
the
ensign
of
bahaullah
is
being
held
aloft
in
the
world
both
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
consider
what
a
mighty
power
this
is
what
a
decisive
argument
although
a
prisoner
in
a
fortress
he
paid
no
heed
to
these
kings
regarded
not
their
power
of
life
and
death
but
on
the
contrary
addressed
them
in
plain
and
fearless
language
announcing
explicitly
that
the
time
would
come
when
their
sovereignty
would
be
brought
low
and
his
own
dominion
be
established
he
said
in
substance
erelong
you
will
find
yourselves
in
manifest
loss
your
sovereignties
will
be
laid
waste
your
empires
will
become
a
wilderness
and
a
heap
of
ruins
hosts
from
without
will
invade
and
subdue
your
lands
lamentation
and
mourning
will
rise
from
your
homes
there
will
be
no
throne
there
will
be
no
crown
there
will
be
no
palace
there
will
be
no
armies
nay
rather
all
these
will
be
brought
low
but
the
standard
of
the
cause
of
god
will
be
held
aloft
then
will
you
see
that
hosts
and
hosts
will
enter
the
cause
of
god
and
that
this
mighty
revelation
will
be
spread
throughout
the
world
read
the
prophecies
contained
in
the
suratulhaykal
and
ponder
carefully
over
them
this
is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
bahaullahs
message
and
teachings
can
you
find
events
and
happenings
of
this
kind
in
any
other
prophetic
dispensation
if
so
in
what
cycle
have
similar
things
taken
place
do
you
find
such
specific
prophecies
and
explicit
statements
concerning
the
future
in
the
holy
books
of
the
past
we
will
now
compare
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
with
the
holy
words
which
have
descended
in
the
former
cycles
first
among
the
great
principles
revealed
by
him
is
that
of
the
investigation
of
reality
the
meaning
is
that
every
individual
member
of
humankind
is
exhorted
and
commanded
to
set
aside
superstitious
beliefs
traditions
and
blind
imitation
of
ancestral
forms
in
religion
and
investigate
reality
for
himself
inasmuch
as
the
fundamental
reality
is
one
all
religions
and
nations
of
the
world
will
become
one
through
investigation
of
reality
the
announcement
of
this
principle
is
not
found
in
any
of
the
sacred
books
of
the
past
a
second
characteristic
principle
of
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
is
that
which
commands
recognition
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
addressing
all
mankind
he
says
ye
are
all
the
leaves
of
one
tree
there
are
no
differences
or
distinctions
of
race
among
you
in
the
sight
of
god
nay
rather
all
are
the
servants
of
god
and
all
are
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
his
oneness
not
a
single
soul
is
bereft
on
the
contrary
all
are
the
recipients
of
the
bounties
of
god
every
human
creature
has
a
portion
of
his
bestowals
and
a
share
of
the
effulgence
of
his
reality
god
is
kind
to
all
mankind
are
his
sheep
and
he
is
their
real
shepherd
no
other
scriptures
contain
such
breadth
and
universality
of
statement
no
other
teachings
proclaim
this
unequivocal
principle
of
the
solidarity
of
humanity
as
regards
any
possible
distinctions
the
utmost
that
bahaullah
says
is
that
conditions
among
men
vary
that
some
for
instance
are
defective
therefore
such
souls
must
be
educated
in
order
that
they
may
be
brought
to
the
degree
of
perfection
some
are
sick
and
ailing
they
must
be
treated
and
cared
for
until
they
are
healed
some
are
asleep
they
need
to
be
awakened
some
are
immature
as
children
they
should
be
helped
to
attain
maturity
but
all
must
be
loved
and
cherished
the
child
must
not
be
disliked
simply
because
it
is
a
child
nay
rather
it
should
be
patiently
educated
the
sick
one
must
not
be
avoided
nor
slighted
merely
because
he
is
ailing
nay
rather
he
must
be
regarded
with
sympathy
and
affection
and
treated
until
he
is
healed
the
soul
that
is
asleep
must
not
be
looked
upon
with
contempt
but
awakened
and
led
into
the
light
bahaullah
teaches
that
religion
must
be
in
conformity
with
science
and
reason
if
belief
and
teaching
are
opposed
to
the
analysis
of
reason
and
principles
of
science
they
are
not
worthy
of
acceptance
this
principle
has
not
been
revealed
in
any
of
the
former
books
of
divine
teaching
another
fundamental
announcement
made
by
bahaullah
is
that
religion
must
be
the
source
of
unity
and
fellowship
in
the
world
if
it
is
productive
of
enmity
hatred
and
bigotry
the
absence
of
religion
would
be
preferable
this
is
a
new
principle
of
revelation
found
only
in
the
utterances
of
bahaullah
again
bahaullah
declares
that
all
forms
of
prejudice
among
mankind
must
be
abandoned
and
that
until
existing
prejudices
are
entirely
removed
the
world
of
humanity
will
not
and
cannot
attain
peace
prosperity
and
composure
this
principle
cannot
be
found
in
any
other
sacred
volume
than
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
another
teaching
is
that
there
shall
be
perfect
equality
between
men
and
women
why
should
man
create
a
distinction
which
god
does
not
recognize
in
the
kingdoms
below
man
sex
exists
but
the
distinction
between
male
and
female
is
neither
repressive
nor
restrictive
the
mare
for
instance
is
as
strong
and
often
more
speedy
than
the
horse
throughout
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
there
is
perfect
equality
between
the
sexes
in
the
kingdom
of
mankind
this
equality
must
likewise
exist
and
the
one
whose
heart
is
purest
whose
life
and
character
are
highest
and
nearest
to
the
divine
standard
is
most
worthy
and
excellent
in
the
sight
of
god
this
is
the
only
true
and
real
distinction
be
that
one
man
or
woman
bahaullah
has
announced
the
necessity
for
a
universal
language
which
shall
serve
as
a
means
of
international
communication
and
thus
remove
misunderstandings
and
difficulties
this
teaching
is
set
forth
in
the
kitabiaqdas
most
holy
book
published
fifty
years
ago
he
has
also
proclaimed
the
principle
that
all
mankind
shall
be
educated
and
that
no
illiteracy
be
allowed
to
remain
this
practical
remedy
for
the
need
of
the
world
cannot
be
found
in
the
text
of
any
other
sacred
books
he
teaches
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
all
mankind
to
become
fitted
for
some
useful
trade
craft
or
profession
by
which
subsistence
may
be
assured
and
this
efficiency
is
to
be
considered
as
an
act
of
worship
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
are
boundless
and
without
end
in
their
farreaching
benefit
to
mankind
the
point
and
purpose
of
our
statement
today
is
that
they
are
new
and
that
they
are
not
found
in
any
of
the
religious
books
of
the
past
this
is
in
answer
to
the
question
what
has
bahaullah
brought
that
we
have
not
heard
before
therefore
it
is
conclusive
and
evident
that
the
manifestation
of
god
in
this
day
is
distinguished
from
all
former
appearances
and
revelations
by
his
majesty
his
power
and
the
efficacy
and
application
of
his
word
all
the
prophets
of
god
were
scorned
and
persecuted
consider
moses
the
people
called
him
a
murderer
they
said
you
killed
a
man
and
fled
from
punishment
and
retribution
is
it
possible
after
your
former
deeds
that
you
could
become
a
prophet
many
similar
experiences
are
recorded
concerning
the
holy
divine
messengers
how
bitter
and
severe
was
the
persecution
to
which
they
were
subjected
consider
how
they
endeavored
to
efface
and
belittle
christ
they
placed
upon
his
head
a
crown
of
thorns
and
paraded
him
through
the
streets
and
bazaars
in
mockery
crying
peace
be
upon
thee
thou
king
of
the
jews
some
would
bow
to
him
backward
saying
in
scornful
tones
thou
king
of
the
jews
or
lord
of
lords
peace
be
upon
thee
still
others
would
spit
upon
his
blessed
countenance
in
brief
the
persecutions
which
christ
suffered
during
the
time
of
his
manifestation
are
mentioned
in
the
books
of
the
old
cycle
jewish
roman
or
greek
no
praises
were
bestowed
upon
him
the
only
recognition
and
acceptance
offered
him
was
from
his
believers
and
followers
peter
for
instance
was
one
who
praised
him
and
the
other
disciples
spoke
in
his
behalf
numerous
books
were
written
against
him
in
the
history
of
the
church
you
will
find
record
of
the
hatred
and
antagonism
manifested
by
the
roman
greek
and
egyptian
philosophers
attributing
calumnies
and
ascribing
imperfection
to
him
but
during
the
manifestation
of
bahaullah
from
the
day
of
his
appearance
to
the
time
of
his
departure
the
people
of
all
nations
acknowledged
his
greatness
and
even
those
who
were
his
most
bitter
enemies
have
said
of
him
this
man
was
truly
great
his
influence
was
mighty
and
wonderful
this
personage
was
glorious
his
power
was
tremendous
his
speech
most
eloquent
but
alas
he
was
a
misleader
of
the
people
this
was
the
essence
of
their
praise
eulogy
and
denial
it
is
evident
that
the
authors
of
such
statements
although
his
enemies
were
profoundly
impressed
by
his
greatness
and
majesty
some
of
his
enemies
have
even
written
poems
about
him
which
though
intended
for
satire
and
sarcastic
allusion
have
in
reality
been
praise
for
instance
a
certain
poet
opposed
to
his
cause
has
said
beware
beware
lest
ye
approach
this
person
for
he
is
possessed
of
such
power
and
of
such
an
eloquent
tongue
that
he
is
a
sorcerer
he
charms
men
he
drugs
them
he
is
a
hypnotizer
beware
beware
lest
you
read
his
book
follow
his
example
and
associate
with
his
companions
because
they
are
the
possessors
of
tremendous
power
and
they
are
misleaders
that
is
to
say
this
poet
used
such
characterizations
believing
them
to
be
terms
of
belittlement
and
disparagement
unaware
that
they
were
in
reality
praises
because
a
wise
man
after
reading
such
a
warning
would
say
the
power
of
this
man
must
unquestionably
be
very
great
if
even
his
enemies
acknowledge
it
undoubtedly
such
a
power
is
heavenly
in
its
nature
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
so
many
were
moved
to
investigate
the
more
his
enemies
wrote
against
him
the
more
the
people
were
attracted
and
the
greater
the
number
who
came
to
inquire
about
the
truth
they
would
say
this
is
remarkable
this
is
a
great
man
and
we
must
investigate
we
must
look
into
this
cause
to
find
out
what
it
all
means
to
discover
its
purpose
examine
its
proofs
and
learn
for
ourselves
what
it
signifies
in
this
way
the
malign
and
sinister
statements
of
his
enemies
caused
the
people
to
become
friendly
and
approach
the
cause
in
persia
the
mullas
went
so
far
as
to
proclaim
from
the
pulpits
against
the
cause
of
bahaullah
casting
their
turbans
upon
the
grounda
sign
of
great
agitationand
crying
out
o
people
this
bahaullah
is
a
sorcerer
who
is
seeking
to
mesmerize
you
he
is
alienating
you
from
your
own
religion
and
making
you
his
own
followers
beware
lest
you
read
his
book
beware
lest
you
associate
with
his
friends
bahaullah
speaking
of
these
very
ones
who
were
attacking
and
decrying
him
said
they
are
my
heralds
they
are
the
ones
who
are
proclaiming
my
message
and
spreading
my
word
pray
that
they
may
be
multiplied
pray
that
their
number
may
increase
and
that
they
may
cry
out
more
loudly
the
more
they
abuse
me
by
their
words
and
the
greater
their
agitation
the
more
potent
and
mighty
will
be
the
efficacy
of
the
cause
of
god
the
more
luminous
the
light
of
the
word
and
the
greater
the
radiance
of
the
divine
sun
and
eventually
the
gloomy
darkness
of
the
outer
world
will
disappear
and
the
light
of
reality
will
shine
until
the
whole
earth
will
be
effulgent
with
its
glory

wherever

baha
tihran
is
the
paradise
of

for
souls
are
found
there
you
cannot
call
human
they
are
angels
in
reality
the
bahai
friends
in
that
city
are
of
the
heavenly
host
whenever
i
think
of
them
i
become
happy
the
blessed
perfection
suffered
innumerable
ordeals
and
calamities
but
during
his
lifetime
he
trained
in
all
regions
many
souls
who
were
peerless
the
purpose
of
the
appearance
of
the
manifestations
of
god
is
the
training
of
the
people
that
is
the
only
result
of
their
mission
the
real
outcome
the
outcome
of
the
whole
life
of
jesus
was
the
training
of
eleven
disciples
and
two
women
why
did
he
suffer
troubles
ordeals
and
calamities
for
the
training
of
these
few
followers
that
was
the
result
of
his
life
the
product
of
the
life
of
christ
was
not
the
churches
but
the
illumined
souls
of
those
who
believed
in
him
afterward
they
spread
his
teachings
it
is
my
hope
that
you
all
may
become
the
product
of
the
life
of
bahaullah
and
the
outcomes
of
his
heavenly
training
when
the

ask
you
what

accomplished

this
is
a

for
these
revered
souls
have
come
together
in
complete
unity
and
with
an
intelligent
purpose
it
is
an
occasion
of
great
joy
to
me
before

aglow
with

attuned
to
the

and

illumined
by
the

all

things
have
their
degree

of

the
period
of
maturity
in
the

of
a
tree
is
the
time
of
its
fruit
bearing
the
maturity
of
a
plant
is
the
time
of
its
blossoming
and
flower
the
animal
attains
a
stage
of
full
growth
and
completeness
and
in
the
human

man
reaches
his
maturity
when
the
lights
of
intelligence
have
their
greatest
power
and
development
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
life
man
passes
through
certain
periods
or
stages
each
of
which
is
marked
by
certain
conditions
peculiar
to
itself
for
instance
during
the
period
of
childhood
his
conditions
and
requirements
are
characteristic
of
that
degree
of
intelligence
and
capacity
after
a
time
he
enters
the
period
of
youth
in
which
his
former
conditions
and
needs
are
superseded
by
new
requirements
applicable
to
the
advance
in
his
degree
his
faculties
of
observation
are
broadened
and
deepened
his
intelligent
capacities
are
trained
and
awakened
the
limitations
and
environment
of
childhood
no
longer
restrict
his
energies
and
accomplishments
at
last
he
passes
out
of
the
period
of
youth
and
enters
the
stage
or
station
of
maturity
which
necessitates
another
transformation
and
corresponding
advance
in
his
sphere
of
life
activity
new
powers
and
perceptions
clothe
him
teaching
and
training
commensurate
with
his
progression
occupy
his

special
bounties
and
bestowals
descend
in
proportion
to
his
increased
capacities
and
his
former
period
of
youth
and
its
conditions
will
no
longer
satisfy
his
matured
view
and
vision
similarly
there
are
periods
and
stages
in
the
life
of
the
aggregate
world
of
humanity
which
at
one
time
was
passing
through
its
degree
of
childhood
at
another
its
time
of
youth
but
now
has
entered
its
long
presaged
period
of
maturity
the
evidences
of
which
are
everywhere
visible
and
apparent
therefore
the
requirements
and
conditions
of
former
periods
have
changed
and
merged
into
exigencies
which
distinctly
characterize
the
present
age
of
the
world
of
mankind
that
which
was
applicable
to
human
needs
during
the
early
history
of

could
neither
meet
nor
satisfy
the
demands
of
this
day
and
period
of
newness

consummation
humanity
has
emerged
from
its
former
degrees

new
virtues

new

new

new
bounties

and
perfections
are
awaiting
and
already
descending
upon
him
the
gifts
and
graces
of
the
period
of
youth
although
timely
and
sufficient
during
the
adolescence
of
the
world
of
mankind
are
now
incapable
of
meeting
the
requirements
of
its

the

no

the

from

standpoint
the

undergoing
a
reformation
the

the
new

now
old

will
not
suffice

the

this
is
the
cycle
of
maturity
and
reformation
in
religion
as
well
dogmatic
imitations
of
ancestral
beliefs
are
passing
they
have
been
the
axis
around
which
religion
revolved
but
now
are
no
longer
fruitful
on
the
contrary
in
this
day
they
have
become
the
cause
of
human
degradation
and
hindrance
bigotry
and
dogmatic
adherence
to
ancient

have
become
the
central
and
fundamental
source
of
animosity
among

the
obstacle
to

the
cause
of

the
destroyer

these
conditions

the
outcome
of

between
nations

peoples
of
religion
who
imitate

infinite
bounties

everyone

will
admit
that
the
teachings
of
the
present
day
emanating
from
mere
human
sources
and
authority
are
the
cause
of
difficulty
and
disagreement
amongst
mankind
the
very
destroyers
of
humanity
whereas
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
are
the
very
healing
of
the
sick
world
the
remedy
for
every
need
and
condition
in
them
may
be
found
the
realization
of
every
desire

aspiration
the
cause
of
the
happiness
of
the

of
humanity
the
stimulus

basis
of
unity
for
all

the
fountain
source

the
center

the
means

the
one
bond
which
will
unite
the
east
and
the
west
after
every
night
there
is
a
morn
in
the
supreme
wisdom
of
god
it
is
decreed
that
when
the
gross
darkness
of
religious
hatred
and
hostility
the
obscurity
of
religious
ignorance
superstition
and
blind
imitations
cover
the
world
the
sun
of
truth
shall
arise
and
the
spirit
of
reality
become
manifest
and
reflected
in
human
hearts
at
such
a
time
as
this
bahaullah
appeared
upon
the
horizon
of
the
orient
for
fifty
years
he
endured
the
greatest
hardships
and
ordeals
ever
striving
to
dispel
the
darkness
of
religious
conditions
to
remove
the
cause
of
enmity
and
rancor
to
awaken
the
world
of
humanity
from
the
beds
of
negligence
and
heedlessness
by
the
flashing
light
of
the
glorious
glad
tidings
and
trumpet
tone
of
the
heavenly
call
and
summons
for
the
spread
of
this
message
he
offered
his
life
and
bore
every
vicissitude
he
was
always
under
the
threat
and
menace
of
the
sword
yet
he
uplifted
the
standard
of
divine
teachings
and
flooded
the
world
of
the
east
with
illumination
in
the
orient
today
the
light
of
the
heavenly
glad
tidings
is
visible
everywhere
the
divine
call
is
heard
the
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
reality
is
shining
the
precious
rain
is
pouring
down
from
the
clouds
of
mercy
and
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
are
bestowing
fresh
life
upon
the
hearts
of
men
erelong
the
darkness
will
pass
away
entirely
and
the
regions
of
the
east
will
become
completely
illumined
enmity
hatred
ignorance
and
bigotry
will
no
longer
remain
the
satanic
powers
which
destroy
human
equality
and
religious
unity
will
be
dethroned
and
the
nations
will
dwell
in
peace
and
harmony
under
the
overspreading
banner
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
therefore
we
supplicate
the
lord
our
god
with
sincere
and
contrite
hearts
asking
aid
and
assistance
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
mighty
end
that
the
nations
shall
be
unified
in
the
word
of
god
that
war
enmity
and
hatred
between
races
religions
native
lands
and
denominations
shall
disappear
and
be
forever
unknown
and
that
peoples
and
nations
shall
spiritually
embrace
each
other
in
the
indissoluble
bond
and
power
of
the
love
of
god
then
will
the
world
of
humanity
become
radiant
and
the
human
race
enjoy
to
the
fullest
capacity
the
graces
of
divine
bestowal
so
long
as
religious
discord
and
enmity
continue
among
mankind
the
world
of
humanity
will
find
neither
happiness
rest
nor
composure
pray
that
god
may
assist
in
this
heavenly
undertaking
that
the
world
of
mankind
shall
be
saved
from
the
ordeals
of
ignorance
blindness

notes
by
esther
foster
i
offer
thanks
to
god
for
this
meeting
with
you
from
the
outer
standpoint
such
meetings
are
inconceivable
for
we
are
orientals
whereas
you
are
occidentals
between
us
there
is
no
patriotic
linguistic
racial
commercial
nor
political
relation
no
worldly
bond
nor
connection
of
any
kind
exists
between
us
that
would
justify
such
a
gathering
as
this
the
love
of
god
has
brought
us
together
and
this
is
the
best
of
means
and
motive
every
other
bond
of
friendship
is
limited
in
effectiveness
but
fellowship
based
upon
the
love
of
god
is
unlimited
everlasting
divine
and
radiant
therefore
we
must
be
thankful
to
god
for
uniting
us
in
love
and
agreement
praise
him
for
creating
such
affinity
between
us
that
those
from
the
faraway
orient
may
associate
with
the
beloved
ones
of
the
west
in
the
utmost
fragrance
surely
for
everything
there
is
an
allcomprehending
wisdom
especially
for
the
great
and
important
affairs
of
life
the
supreme
and
most
important
happening
in
the
human
world
is
the
manifestation
of
god
and
the
descent
of
the
law
of
god
the
holy
divine
manifestations
did
not
reveal
themselves
for
the
purpose
of
founding
a
nation
sect
or
faction
they
did
not
appear
in
order
that
a
certain
number
might
acknowledge
their
prophethood
they
did
not
declare
their
heavenly
mission
and
message
in
order
to
lay
the
foundation
for
a
religious
belief
even
christ
did
not
become
manifest
that
we
should
merely
believe
in
him
as
the
christ
follow
him
and
adore
his
mention
all
these
are
limited
in
scope
and
requirement
whereas
the
reality
of
christ
is
an
unlimited
essence
the
infinite
and
unlimited
reality
cannot
be
bounded
by
any
limitation
nay
rather
christ
appeared
in
order
to
illumine
the
world
of
humanity
to
render
the
earthly
world
celestial
to
make
the
human
kingdom
a
realm
of
angels
to
unite
the
hearts
to
enkindle
the
light
of
love
in
human
souls
so
that
such
souls
might
become
independent
attaining
complete
unity
and
fellowship
turning
to
god
entering
into
the
divine
kingdom
receiving
the
bounties
and
bestowals
of
god
and
partaking
of
the
manna
from
heaven
through
christ
they
were
intended
to
be
baptized
by
the
holy
spirit
attain
a
new
spirit
and
realize
the
everlasting
life
all
the
holy
precepts
and
the
announcements
of
prophetic
laws
were
for
these
various
and
heavenly
purposes
therefore
we
offer
thanks
to
god
that
although
no
earthly
relation
obtains
among
us
yetpraise
be
to
godideal
and
divine
bonds
blend
us
together
we
have
gathered
here
in
this
meeting
eagerly
anticipating
the
showing
forth
of
the
divine
bestowals
in
past
centuries
the
nations
of
the
world
have
imagined
that
the
law
of
god
demanded
blind
imitation
of
ancestral
forms
of
belief
and
worship
for
example
the
jews
were
captives
of
hereditary
racial
religious
observances
the
muslims
likewise
have
been
held
in
the
bondage
of
traditionary
forms
and
ceremonials
the
christians
also
have
been
implicit
followers
of
ancient
tradition
and
hereditary
teaching
at
the
same
time
the
basic
foundation
of
the
religion
of
god
which
was
ever
the
principle
of
love
unity
and
the
fellowship
of
humanity
has
been
forsaken
and
cast
aside
each
religious
system
holding
tenaciously
to
imitations
of
ancestral
forms
as
the
supreme
essential
therefore
hatred
and
hostility
have
appeared
in
the
world
instead
of
the
divine
fruitage
of
unity
and
love
by
reason
of
this
it
has
been
impossible
for
the
followers
of
religion
to
meet
together
in
fellowship
and
agreement
even
contact
and
communication
have
been
considered
contaminating
and
the
outcome
has
been
a
condition
of
complete
alienation
and
mutual
bigotry
there
has
been
no
investigation
of
the
essential
underlying
basis
of
reality
one
whose
father
was
a
jew
invariably
proved
to
be
a
jew
a
muslim
was
born
of
a
muslim
a
buddhist
was
a
buddhist
because
of
the
faith
of
his
father
before
him
and
so
on
in
brief
religion
was
a
heritage
descending
from
father
to
son
ancestry
to
posterity
without
investigation
of
the
fundamental
reality
consequently
all
religionists
were
veiled
obscured
and
at
variance
praise
be
to
god
we
are
living
in
this
most
radiant
century
wherein
human
perceptions
have
developed
and
investigations
of
real
foundations
characterize
mankind
individually
and
collectively
man
is
proving
and
penetrating
into
the
reality
of
outer
and
inner
conditions
therefore
it
has
come
to
pass
that
we
are
renouncing
all
that
savors
of
blind
imitation
and
impartially
and
independently
investigating
truth
let
us
understand
what
constitutes
the
reality
of
the
divine
religions
if
a
christian
sets
aside
traditionary
forms
and
blind
imitation
of
ceremonials
and
investigates
the
reality
of
the
gospels
he
will
discover
that
the
foundation
principles
of
the
teachings
of
christ
were
mercy
love
fellowship
benevolence
altruism
the
resplendence
or
radiance
of
divine
bestowals
acquisition
of
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
oneness
with
god
furthermore
he
will
learn
that
christ
declared
that
the
father
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good
and
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
the
meaning
of
this
declaration
is
that
the
mercy
of
god
encircles
all
mankind
that
not
a
single
individual
is
deprived
of
the
mercy
of
god
and
no
soul
is
denied
the
resplendent
bestowals
of
god
the
whole
human
race
is
submerged
in
the
sea
of
the
mercy
of
the
lord
and
we
are
all
the
sheep
of
the
one
divine
shepherd
whatever
shortcomings
exist
among
us
must
be
remedied
for
example
those
who
are
ignorant
must
be
educated
so
that
they
may
become
wise
the
sick
must
be
treated
until
they
recover
those
who
are
immature
must
be
trained
in
order
to
reach
maturity
those
asleep
must
be
awakened
all
this
must
be
accomplished
through
love
and
not
through
hatred
and
hostility
furthermore
jesus
christ
referring
to
the
prophecy
of
isaiah
spoke
of
those
who
having
eyes
see
not
having
ears
hear
not
having
hearts
understand
not
yet
they
were
to
be
healed
therefore
it
is
evident
that
the
bounties
of
christ
transformed
the
eye
which
was
blind
into
a
seeing
one
rendered
the
ear
which
was
formerly
deaf
attentive
and
made
the
hard
callous
heart
tender
and
sensitive
in
other
words
the
meaning
is
that
although
the
people
possess
external
eyes
yet
the
insight
or
perception
of
the
soul
is
blind
although
the
outer
ear
hears
the
spiritual
hearing
is
deaf
although
they
possess
conscious
hearts
they
are
without
illumination
and
the
bounties
of
christ
save
souls
from
these
conditions
it
is
evident
then
that
the
manifestation
of
the
messiah
was
synonymous
with
universal
mercy
his
providence
was
universal
and
his
teachings
were
for
all
his
lights
were
not
restricted
to
a
few
every
christ
came
to
the
world
of
mankind
therefore
we
must
investigate
the
foundation
of
divine
religion
discover
its
reality
reestablish
it
and
spread
its
message
throughout
the
world
so
that
it
may
become
the
source
of
illumination
and
enlightenment
to
mankind
the
spiritually
dead
become
alive
the
spiritually
blind
receive
sight
and
those
who
are
inattentive
to
god
become
awakened
the
teachings
and
ordinances
of
the
divine
religions
are
of
two
kinds
the
first
are
spiritual
and
essential
in
naturesuch
as
faith
in
god
faith
in
christ
faith
in
moses
faith
in
abraham
faith
in
muhammad
the
love
of
god
and
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
these
divine
principles
shall
be
spread
throughout
the
world
strife
and
enmity
shall
disappear
ignorance
hatred
and
hostility
cease
and
all
the
human
race
be
bound
together
the
second
kind
of
ordinances
and
teachings
concern
the
outer
conditions
and
transactions
of
the
world
of
mankind
they
are
the
nonessential
accidental
or
temporary
laws
of
human
affairs
which
are
subject
to
change
and
transformation
according
to
the
exigencies
of
time
and
place
for
instance
during
the
time
of
moses
divorce
was
permitted
but
in
the
time
of
christ
it
was
made
unlawful
in
the
torah
there
are
ten
commandments
concerning
retribution
for
murder
which
would
not
be
possible
to
enforce
at
the
present
time
and
under
existing
conditions
of
the
world
therefore
these
nonessential
temporary
laws
are
superseded
and
abrogated
to
suit
the
exigencies
and
requirements
of
successive
periods
but
the
followers
of
the
divine
religions
have
turned
away
from
the
principles
and
ordinances
which
are
essential
and
unchanging
in
the
word
of
god
forsaking
those
fundamental
realities
which
have
to
do
with
the
life
of
the
human
world
the
eternal
lifesuch
as
the
love
of
god
faith
in
god
philanthropy
knowledge
spiritual
perception
divine
guidanceholding
these
to
be
contingent
and
nonessential
while
wrangling
and
disagreeing
over
such
questions
as
whether
divorce
is
lawful
or
unlawful
or
whether
this
or
that
observance
of
a
minor
law
is
orthodox
and
true
the
jews
consider
divorce
lawful
the
catholic
christians
deem
it
unlawful
the
outcome
is
discord
and
hostility
between
them
if
they
would
investigate
the
one
fundamental
reality
underlying
the
laws
revealed
by
moses
and
christ
this
condition
of
hatred
and
misunderstanding
would
be
dispelled
and
divine
unity
prevail
christ
commanded
that
if
we
are
smitten
upon
the
right
cheek
we
should
turn
the
other
cheek
also
consider
what
is
happening
now
in
the
balkans
what
conformity
with
the
teachings
of
christ
do
we
witness
in
that
deplorable
picture
has
not
man
absolutely
forgotten
and
forsaken
the
divine
command
of
christ
in
fact
such
discord
and
warfare
are
evidences
of
disagreement
upon
the
nonessential
precepts
and
laws
of
religious
belief
investigation
of
the
one
fundamental
reality
and
allegiance
to
the
essential
unchanging
principles
of
the
word
of
god
can
alone
establish
unity
and
love
in
human
hearts
throughout
the
orient
in
the
nineteenth
century
spiritual
darkness
prevailed
and
the
religions
were
submerged
in
the
ocean
of
blind
imitations
and
adherence
to
hereditary
forms
there
was
no
trace
of
the
essential
foundation
of
divine
revelation
because
of
this
hostility
and
hatred
surrounded
mankind
discord
rancor
and
warfare
afflicted
humanity
blood
overspread
the
horizons
of
the
eastern
world
instead
of
fellowship
and
agreement
religion
had
become
the
cause
of
hatred
instead
of
unity
it
produced
discord
enmity
and
strife
the
conditions
were
similar
to
those
existing
in
the
balkans
today
where
it
might
appear
as
if
the
basis
of
divine
religion
were
war
and
conflict
the
adherents
of
one
religion
seeking
to
extirpate
and
destroy
another
and
the
adherents
of
both
imbued
with
the
fanatical
impulse
to
kill
they
consider
the
pathway
to
the
good
pleasure
of
god
a
pathway
of
blood
and
the
more
a
religionist
kills
the
nearer
he
draws
to
god
these
are
the
results
of
blind
imitations
how
gloomy
and
destructive
to
humanity
is
such
an
outcome
if
this
be
the
foundation
of
divine
religion
its
absence
is
preferable
for
even
the
infidels
do
not
shed
blood
in
this
way
nor
are
they
hostile
toward
each
other
the
forces
of
hostility
and
strife
are
the
religions
of
the
present
day
and
that
which
should
have
contributed
to
the
illumination
and
betterment
of
the
world
has
become
productive
of
gross
darkness
and
degradation
to
resume
consider
how
similar
blind
imitations
had
made
the
darkness
in
the
orient
allencircling
at
such
a
time
bahaullah
dawned
from
the
eastern
horizon
like
the
glory
of
the
sun
he
renewed
the
basis
of
the
religions
of
god
destroyed
blind
adherence
to
ancestral
forms
and
established
in
their
stead
love
and
spiritual
fellowship
so
that
no
strife
discord
or
hostility
remained
this
reconciliation
of
divergent
sects
is
visible
and
evident
they
now
live
together
in
love
and
unity
if
you
should
enter
one
of
their
meetings
you
would
realize
that
they
have
become
as
one
race
one
native
land
one
religion
that
they
associate
together
in
brotherhood
and
agreement
praise
be
to
god
these
blind
imitations
and
this
darkness
have
ceased
to
exist
and
the
reality
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
has
been
practically
proven
i
consider
the
american
people
a
highly
civilized
and
intelligent
nation
a
nation
investigating
truth
and
reality
it
is
my
hope
that
through
the
efforts
of
this
noble
nation
the
solidarity
of
humanity
may
be
continually
advanced
that
the
illumination
of
the
human
world
may
become
widespread
that
the
banner
of
universal
peace
may
be
held
aloft
the
lamp
of
the
oneness
of
the
human
world
be
ignited
and
the
hearts
of
the
east
and
west
be
conjoined
then
the
reality
of
the
divine
religions
shall
become
resplendent
and
refulgent
indicating
that
they
were
meant
to
be
the
cause
of
unity
and
love
and
that
through
them
heavenly
bestowals
have
ever
been
conferring
light
upon
the
human

throughout
the
world
there
are
innumerable
meetings
and
assemblages
more
or
less
important
according
to
their
measure
of
contribution
to
human
betterment
yet
limited
in
their
purpose
and
object
to
material
questions
and
outcomes
they
are
political
commercial

in

they
seek
to
promote
economic
advancement
further
agricultural
purposes
encourage
scientific

they
provide
for
the
establishment
of
new

plan
financial

and
agree
upon
laws
of
civic

such
meetings
are
useful

their
influence
and

do
not
extend

is

they

this
meeting
of
yours
tonight
is
very
different
in

it
is
a
universal
gathering
it
is
heavenly

it
serves
the

of
the

november
talk
at
home
of
mr
and
mrs
edward
b
kinney
west
end
avenue
new
york
notes
by
esther
foster
this
evening
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
concerning
the
mystery
of
sacrifice
there
are
two
kinds
of
sacrifice
the
physical
and
the
spiritual
the
explanation
made
by
the
churches
concerning
this
subject
is
in
reality
superstition
for
instance
it
is
recorded
in
the
gospel
that
christ
said
i
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
if
any
man
eat
of
this
bread
he
shall
live
for
ever
he
also
said
this
wine
is
my
blood
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of
sins
these
verses
have
been
interpreted
by
the
churches
in
such
a
superstitious
way
that
it
is
impossible
for
human
reason
to
understand
or
accept
the
explanation
they
say
that
adam
disobeyed
the
command
of
god
and
partook
of
the
fruit
of
the
forbidden
tree
thereby
committing
a
sin
which
was
transmitted
as
a
heritage
to
his
posterity
they
teach
that
because
of
adams
sin
all
his
descendants
have
likewise
committed
transgression
and
have
become
responsible
through
inheritance
that
consequently
all
mankind
deserves
punishment
and
must
make
retribution
and
that
god
sent
forth
his
son
as
a
sacrifice
in
order
that
man
might
be
forgiven
and
the
human
race
delivered
from
the
consequences
of
adams
transgression
we
wish
to
consider
these
statements
from
the
standpoint
of
reason
could
we
conceive
of
the
divinity
who
is
justice
itself
inflicting
punishment
upon
the
posterity
of
adam
for
adams
own
sin
and
disobedience
even
if
we
should
see
a
governor
an
earthly
ruler
punishing
a
son
for
the
wrongdoing
of
his
father
we
would
look
upon
that
ruler
as
an
unjust
man
granted
the
father
committed
a
wrong
what
was
the
wrong
committed
by
the
son
there
is
no
connection
between
the
two
adams
sin
was
not
the
sin
of
his
posterity
especially
as
adam
is
a
thousand
generations
back
of
the
man
today
if
the
father
of
a
thousand
generations
committed
a
sin
is
it
just
to
demand
that
the
present
generation
should
suffer
the
consequences
thereof
there
are
other
questions
and
evidences
to
be
considered
abraham
was
a
manifestation
of
god
and
a
descendant
of
adam
likewise
ishmael
isaac
jeremiah
and
the
whole
line
of
prophets
including
david
solomon
and
aaron
were
among
his
posterity
were
all
these
holy
men
condemned
to
a
realm
of
punishment
because
of
a
deed
committed
by
the
first
father
because
of
a
mistake
said
to
have
been
made
by
their
mutual
and
remotest
ancestor
adam
the
explanation
is
made
that
when
christ
came
and
sacrificed
himself
all
the
line
of
holy
prophets
who
preceded
him
became
free
from
sin
and
punishment
even
a
child
could
not
justly
make
such
an
assertion
these
interpretations
and
statements
are
due
to
a
misunderstanding
of
the
meanings
of
the
bible
in
order
to
understand
the
reality
of
sacrifice
let
us
consider
the
crucifixion
and
death
of
jesus
christ
it
is
true
that
he
sacrificed
himself
for
our
sake
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
when
christ
appeared
he
knew
that
he
must
proclaim
himself
in
opposition
to
all
the
nations
and
peoples
of
the
earth
he
knew
that
mankind
would
arise
against
him
and
inflict
upon
him
all
manner
of
tribulations
there
is
no
doubt
that
one
who
put
forth
such
a
claim
as
christ
announced
would
arouse
the
hostility
of
the
world
and
be
subjected
to
personal
abuse
he
realized
that
his
blood
would
be
shed
and
his
body
rent
by
violence
notwithstanding
his
knowledge
of
what
would
befall
him
he
arose
to
proclaim
his
message
suffered
all
tribulation
and
hardships
from
the
people
and
finally
offered
his
life
as
a
sacrifice
in
order
to
illumine
humanitygave
his
blood
in
order
to
guide
the
world
of
mankind
he
accepted
every
calamity
and
suffering
in
order
to
guide
men
to
the
truth
had
he
desired
to
save
his
own
life
and
were
he
without
wish
to
offer
himself
in
sacrifice
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
guide
a
single
soul
there
was
no
doubt
that
his
blessed
blood
would
be
shed
and
his
body
broken
nevertheless
that
holy
soul
accepted
calamity
and
death
in
his
love
for
mankind
this
is
one
of
the
meanings
of
sacrifice
as
to
the
second
meaning
he
said
i
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
it
was
not
the
body
of
christ
which
came
from
heaven
his
body
came
from
the
womb
of
mary
but
the
christly
perfections
descended
from
heaven
the
reality
of
christ
came
down
from
heaven
the
spirit
of
christ
and
not
the
body
descended
from
heaven
the
body
of
christ
was
but
human
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
physical
body
was
born
from
the
womb
of
mary
but
the
reality
of
christ
the
spirit
of
christ
the
perfections
of
christ
all
came
from
heaven
consequently
by
saying
he
was
the
bread
which
came
from
heaven
he
meant
that
the
perfections
which
he
showed
forth
were
divine
perfections
that
the
blessings
within
him
were
heavenly
gifts
and
bestowals
that
his
light
was
the
light
of
reality
he
said
if
any
man
eat
of
this
bread
he
shall
live
for
ever
that
is
to
say
whosoever
assimilates
these
divine
perfections
which
are
within
me
will
never
die
whosoever
has
a
share
and
partakes
of
these
heavenly
bounties
i
embody
will
find
eternal
life
he
who
takes
unto
himself
these
divine
lights
shall
find
everlasting
life
how
manifest
the
meaning
is
how
evident
for
the
soul
which
acquires
divine
perfections
and
seeks
heavenly
illumination
from
the
teachings
of
christ
will
undoubtedly
live
eternally
this
is
also
one
of
the
mysteries
of
sacrifice
in
reality
abraham
sacrificed
himself
for
he
brought
heavenly
teachings
to
the
world
and
conferred
heavenly
food
upon
mankind
as
to
the
third
meaning
of
sacrifice
it
is
this
if
you
plant
a
seed
in
the
ground
a
tree
will
become
manifest
from
that
seed
the
seed
sacrifices
itself
to
the
tree
that
will
come
from
it
the
seed
is
outwardly
lost
destroyed
but
the
same
seed
which
is
sacrificed
will
be
absorbed
and
embodied
in
the
tree
its
blossoms
fruit
and
branches
if
the
identity
of
that
seed
had
not
been
sacrificed
to
the
tree
which
became
manifest
from
it
no
branches
blossoms
or
fruits
would
have
been
forthcoming
christ
outwardly
disappeared
his
personal
identity
became
hidden
from
the
eyes
even
as
the
identity
of
the
seed
disappeared
but
the
bounties
divine
qualities
and
perfections
of
christ
became
manifest
in
the
christian
community
which
christ
founded
through
sacrificing
himself
when
you
look
at
the
tree
you
will
realize
that
the
perfections
blessings
properties
and
beauty
of
the
seed
have
become
manifest
in
the
branches
twigs
blossoms
and
fruit
consequently
the
seed
has
sacrificed
itself
to
the
tree
had
it
not
done
so
the
tree
would
not
have
come
into
existence
christ
like
unto
the
seed
sacrificed
himself
for
the
tree
of
christianity
therefore
his
perfections
bounties
favors
lights
and
graces
became
manifest
in
the
christian
community
for
the
coming
of
which
he
sacrificed
himself
as
to
the
fourth
significance
of
sacrifice
it
is
the
principle
that
a
reality
sacrifices
its
own
characteristics
man
must
sever
himself
from
the
influences
of
the
world
of
matter
from
the
world
of
nature
and
its
laws
for
the
material
world
is
the
world
of
corruption
and
death
it
is
the
world
of
evil
and
darkness
of
animalism
and
ferocity
bloodthirstiness
ambition
and
avarice
of
selfworship
egotism
and
passion
it
is
the
world
of
nature
man
must
strip
himself
of
all
these
imperfections
must
sacrifice
these
tendencies
which
are
peculiar
to
the
outer
and
material
world
of
existence
on
the
other
hand
man
must
acquire
heavenly
qualities
and
attain
divine
attributes
he
must
become
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
he
must
seek
the
bounty
of
the
eternal
become
the
manifestor
of
the
love
of
god
the
light
of
guidance
the
tree
of
life
and
the
depository
of
the
bounties
of
god
that
is
to
say
man
must
sacrifice
the
qualities
and
attributes
of
the
world
of
nature
for
the
qualities
and
attributes
of
the
world
of
god
for
instance
consider
the
substance
we
call
iron
observe
its
qualities
it
is
solid
black
cold
these
are
the
characteristics
of
iron
when
the
same
iron
absorbs
heat
from
the
fire
it
sacrifices
its
attribute
of
solidity
for
the
attribute
of
fluidity
it
sacrifices
its
attribute
of
darkness
for
the
attribute
of
light
which
is
a
quality
of
the
fire
it
sacrifices
its
attribute
of
coldness
to
the
quality
of
heat
which
the
fire
possesses
so
that
in
the
iron
there
remains
no
solidity
darkness
or
cold
it
becomes
illumined
and
transformed
having
sacrificed
its
qualities
to
the
qualities
and
attributes
of
the
fire
likewise
man
when
separated
and
severed
from
the
attributes
of
the
world
of
nature
sacrifices
the
qualities
and
exigencies
of
that
mortal
realm
and
manifests
the
perfections
of
the
kingdom
just
as
the
qualities
of
the
iron
disappeared
and
the
qualities
of
the
fire
appeared
in
their
place
every
man
trained
through
the
teachings
of
god
and
illumined
by
the
light
of
his
guidance
who
becomes
a
believer
in
god
and
his
signs
and
is
enkindled
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
sacrifices
the
imperfections
of
nature
for
the
sake
of
divine
perfections
consequently
every
perfect
person
every
illumined
heavenly
individual
stands
in
the
station
of
sacrifice
it
is
my
hope
that
through
the
assistance
and
providence
of
god
and
through
the
bounties
of
the
kingdom
of
abha
you
may
be
entirely
severed
from
the
imperfections
of
the
world
of
nature
purified
from
selfish
human
desires
receiving
life
from
the
kingdom
of
abha
and
attaining
heavenly
graces
may
the
divine
light
become
manifest
upon
your
faces
the
fragrances
of
holiness
refresh
your
nostrils
and
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
quicken
you
with
eternal
life

of
humanity
addressing
mankind
he
says
ye
are
all
leaves
of
one
tree
and
the
fruits
of
one
branch
by
this
it
is
meant
that
the
world
of
humanity
is
like
a
tree
the
nations
or
peoples
are
the
different
limbs
or
branches
of
that
tree
and
the
individual
human
creatures
are
as
the
fruits
and
blossoms
thereof
in
this
way
bahaullah
expressed
the
oneness
of
humankind
whereas
in
all
religious
teachings
of
the
past
the
human
world
has
been
represented
as
divided
into
two
parts
one
known
as
the
people
of
the
book
of
god
or
the
pure
tree
and
the
other
the
people
of
infidelity
and
error
or
the
evil
tree
the
former
were
considered
as
belonging
to
the
faithful
and
the
others
to
the
hosts
of
the
irreligious
and
infidelone
part
of
humanity
the
recipients
of
divine
mercy
and
the
other
the
object
of
the
wrath
of
their
creator
bahaullah
removed
this
by
proclaiming
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
this
principle
is
specialized
in
his
teachings
for
he
has
submerged
all
mankind
in
the
sea
of
divine
generosity
some
are
asleep
they
need
to
be
awakened
some
are
ailing
they
need
to
be
healed
some
are
immature
as
children
they
need
to
be
trained
but
all
are
recipients
of
the
bounty
and
bestowals
of
god
another
new
principle
revealed
by
bahaullah
is
the
injunction
to
investigate
truththat
is
to
say
no
man
should
blindly
follow
his
ancestors
and
forefathers
nay
each
must
see
with
his
own
eyes
hear
with
his
own
ears
and
investigate
the
truth
himself
in
order
that
he
may
follow
the
truth
instead
of
blind
acquiescence
and
imitation
of
ancestral
beliefs
bahaullah
has
announced
that
the
foundation
of
all
the
religions
of
god
is
one
that
oneness
is
truth
and
truth
is
oneness
which
does
not
admit
of
plurality
this
teaching
is
new
and
specialized
to
this
manifestation
he
sets
forth
a
new
principle
for
this
day
in
the
announcement
that
religion
must
be
the
cause
of
unity
harmony
and
agreement
among
mankind
if
it
is
the
cause
of
discord
and
hostility
if
it
leads
to
separation
and
creates
conflict
the
absence
of
religion
would
be
preferable
in
the
world
furthermore
he
proclaims
that
religion
must
be
in
harmony
with
science
and
reason
if
it
does
not
conform
to
science
and
reconcile
with
reason
it
is
superstition
down
to
the
present
day
it
has
been
customary
for
man
to
accept
a
religious
teaching
even
though
it
was
not
in
accord
with
human
reason
and
judgment
the
harmony
of
religious
belief
with
reason
is
a
new
vista
which
bahaullah
has
opened
for
the
soul
of
man
he
establishes
the
equality
of
man
and
woman
this
is
peculiar
to
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
for
all
other
religions
have
placed
man
above
woman
a
new
religious
principle
is
that
prejudice
and
fanaticismwhether
sectarian
denominational
patriotic
or
politicalare
destructive
to
the
foundation
of
human
solidarity
therefore
man
should
release
himself
from
such
bonds
in
order
that
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
may
become
manifest
universal
peace
is
assured
by
bahaullah
as
a
fundamental
accomplishment
of
the
religion
of
godthat
peace
shall
prevail
among
nations
governments
and
peoples
among
religions
races
and
all
conditions
of
mankind
this
is
one
of
the
special
characteristics
of
the
word
of
god
revealed
in
this
manifestation
bahaullah
declares
that
all
mankind
should
attain
knowledge
and
acquire
an
education
this
is
a
necessary
principle
of
religious
belief
and
observance
characteristically
new
in
this
dispensation
he
has
set
forth
the
solution
and
provided
the
remedy
for
the
economic
question
no
religious
books
of
the
past
prophets
speak
of
this
important
human
problem
he
has
ordained
and
established
the
house
of
justice
which
is
endowed
with
a
political
as
well
as
a
religious
function
the
consummate
union
and
blending
of
church
and
state
this
institution
is
under
the
protecting
power
of
bahaullah
himself
a
universal
or
international
house
of
justice
shall
also
be
organized
its
rulings
shall
be
in
accordance
with
the
commands
and
teachings
of
bahaullah
and
that
which
the
universal
house
of
justice
ordains
shall
be
obeyed
by
all
mankind
this
international
house
of
justice
shall
be
appointed
and
organized
from
the
houses
of
justice
of
the
whole
world
and
all
the
world
shall
come
under
its
administration
as
to
the
most
great
characteristic
of
the
revelation
of
bahaullah
a
specific
teaching
not
given
by
any
of
the
prophets
of
the
past
it
is
the
ordination
and
appointment
of
the
center
of
the
covenant
by
this
appointment
and
provision
he
has
safeguarded
and
protected
the
religion
of
god
against
differences
and
schisms
making
it
impossible
for
anyone
to
create
a
new
sect
or
faction
of
belief
to
ensure
unity
and
agreement
he
has
entered
into
a
covenant
with
all
the
people
of
the
world
including
the
interpreter
and
explainer
of
his
teachings
so
that
no
one
may
interpret
or
explain
the
religion
of
god
according
to
his
own
view
or
opinion
and
thus
create
a
sect
founded
upon
his
individual
understanding
of
the
divine
words
the
book
of
the
covenant
or
testament
of
bahaullah
is
the
means
of
preventing
such
a
possibility
for
whosoever
shall
speak
from
the
authority
of
himself
alone
shall
be
degraded
be
ye
informed
and
cognizant
of
this
beware
lest
anyone
shall
secretly
question
or
deny
this
to
you
there
are
some
people
of
selfwill
and
desire
who
do
not
communicate
their
intentions
to
you
in
clear
language
they
envelop
their
meanings
in
secret
statements
and
insinuations
for
instance
they
praise
a
certain
individual
saying
he
is
wise
and
learned
that
he
was
glorified
in
the
presence
of
bahaullah
conveying
this
to
you
in
an
insidious
way
or
by
innuendos
be
ye
aware
of
this
be
awakened
and
enlightened
for
christ
has
said
that
no
one
hides
the
lamp
under
a
bushel
the
purport
of
my
admonition
is
that
certain
people
will
endeavor
to
influence
you
in
the
direction
of
their
own
personal
views
and
opinions
therefore
be
upon
your
guard
in
order
that
none
may
assail
the
oneness
and
integrity
of
bahaullahs
cause
praise
be
to
god
bahaullah
left
nothing
unsaid
he
explained
everything
he
left
no
room
for
anything
further
to
be
said
yet
there
are
some
who
for
the
sake
of
personal
interest
and
prestige
will
attempt
to
sow
the
seeds
of
sedition
and
disloyalty
among
you
to
protect
and
safeguard
the
religion
of
god
from
this
and
all
other
attack
the
center
of
the
covenant
has
been
named
and
appointed
by
bahaullah
therefore
if
anyone
should
set
forth
a
statement
in
praise
or
recognition
of
another
than
this
appointed
center
you
must
ask
him
to
produce
a
written
proof
of
the
authority
he
follows
let
him
show
you
a
trace
from
the
pen
of
the
center
of
the
covenant
himself
substantiating
his
praise
and
support
of
any
other
than
the
rightful
one
inform
him
that
you
are
not
permitted
to
accept
the
words
of
everyone
say
to
him
it
is
possible
to
love
and
praise
a
person
today
to
accept
and
follow
another
tomorrow
and
still
another
next
day
therefore
we
cannot
afford
to
listen
to
this
or
that
individual
where
are
your
proofs
and
writings
where
is
your
authority
from
the
pen
of
the
center
of
the
covenant
my
purpose
is
to
explain
to
you
that
it
is
your
duty
to
guard
the
religion
of
god
so
that
none
shall
be
able
to
assail
it
outwardly
or
inwardly
if
you
find
harmful
teachings
are
being
set
forth
by
some
individual
no
matter
who
that
individual
be
even
though
he
should
be
my
own
son
know
verily
that
i
am
completely
severed
from
him
if
anyone
speaks
against
the
covenant
even
though
he
should
be
my
son
know
that
i
am
opposed
to
him
those
who
speak
falsehoods
who
covet
worldly
things
and
seek
to
accumulate
the
riches
of
this
earth
are
not
of
me
but
when
you
find
a
person
living
up
to
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
following
the
precepts
of
the
hidden
words
know
that
he
belongs
to
bahaullah
and
verily
i
proclaim
that
he
is
of
me
if
on
the
other
hand
you
see
anyone
whose
deeds
and
conduct
are
contrary
to
and
not
in
conformity
with
the
good
pleasure
of
the
blessed
perfection
and
against
the
spirit
of
the
hidden
words
let
that
be
your
standard
and
criterion
of
judgment
against
him
for
know
that
i
am
altogether
severed
from
him
no
matter
who
he
may
be
this
is
the
truth
the
teachings
of
bahaullah
are
boundless
and
illimitable
you
have
asked
me
what
new
principles
have
been
revealed
by
him
i
have
mentioned
a
few
only
there
are
many
others
but
time
does
not
permit
their
mention
tonight
i
therefore
pray
to
god
that
you
may
be
strengthened
in
good
deeds
i
pray
that
god
may
confirm
you
in
order
that
you
may
live
according
to
the
teachings
of
bahaullah

december
talk
to
mr
kinneys
bible
class
west
end
avenue
new
york
notes
by
edna
mckinney
i
have
been
informed
that
the
purpose
of
your
class
meeting
is
to
study
the
significances
and
mysteries
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
understand
the
meaning
of
the
divine
testaments
it
is
a
cause
of
great
happiness
to
me
that
you
are
turning
unto
the
kingdom
of
god
that
you
desire
to
approach
the
presence
of
god
and
to
become
informed
of
the
realities
and
precepts
of
god
it
is
my
hope
that
you
may
put
forth
your
most
earnest
endeavor
to
accomplish
this
end
that
you
may
investigate
and
study
the
holy
scriptures
word
by
word
so
that
you
may
attain
knowledge
of
the
mysteries
hidden
therein
be
not
satisfied
with
words
but
seek
to
understand
the
spiritual
meanings
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
words
the
jews
read
the
old
testament
night
and
day
memorizing
its
words
and
texts
yet
without
comprehending
a
single
meaning
or
inner
significance
for
had
they
understood
the
real
meanings
of
the
old
testament
they
would
have
become
believers
in
christ
inasmuch
as
the
old
testament
was
revealed
to
prepare
his
coming
as
the
jewish
doctors
and
rabbis
did
not
believe
in
christ
it
is
evident
that
they
were
ignorant
of
the
real
significance
of
the
old
testament
it
is
difficult
to
comprehend
even
the
words
of
a
philosopher
how
much
more
difficult
it
is
to
understand
the
words
of
god
the
divine
words
are
not
to
be
taken
according
to
their
outer
sense
they
are
symbolical
and
contain
realities
of
spiritual
meaning
for
instance
in
the
book
of
solomons
songs
you
will
read
about
the
bride
and
bridegroom
it
is
evident
that
the
physical
bride
and
bridegroom
are
not
intended
obviously
these
are
symbols
conveying
a
hidden
and
inner
significance
in
the
same
way
the
revelations
of
st
john
are
not
to
be
taken
literally
but
spiritually
these
are
the
mysteries
of
god
it
is
not
the
reading
of
the
words
that
profits
you
it
is
the
understanding
of
their
meanings
therefore
pray
god
that
you
may
be
enabled
to
comprehend
the
mysteries
of
the
divine
testaments
consider
the
symbolical
meanings
of
the
words
and
teachings
of
christ
he
said
i
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
if
any
man
eat
of
this
bread
he
shall
live
for
ever
when
the
jews
heard
this
they
took
it
literally
and
failed
to
understand
the
significance
of
his
meaning
and
teaching
the
spiritual
truth
which
christ
wished
to
convey
to
them
was
that
the
reality
of
divinity
within
him
was
like
a
blessing
which
had
come
down
from
heaven
and
that
he
who
partook
of
this
blessing
should
never
die
that
is
to
say
bread
was
the
symbol
of
the
perfections
which
had
descended
upon
him
from
god
and
he
who
ate
of
this
bread
or
endowed
himself
with
the
perfections
of
christ
would
undoubtedly
attain
to
everlasting
life
the
jews
did
not
understand
him
and
taking
the
words
literally
said
how
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
eat
had
they
understood
the
real
meaning
of
the
holy
book
they
would
have
become
believers
in
christ
all
the
texts
and
teachings
of
the
holy
testaments
have
intrinsic
spiritual
meanings
they
are
not
to
be
taken
literally
i
therefore
pray
in
your
behalf
that
you
may
be
given
the
power
of
understanding
these
inner
real
meanings
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
may
become
informed
of
the
mysteries
deposited
in
the
words
of
the
bible
so
that
you
may
attain
eternal
life
and
that
your
hearts
may
be
attracted
to
the
kingdom
of
god
may
your
souls
be
illumined
by
the
light
of
the
words
of
god
and
may
you
become
repositories
of
the
mysteries
of
god
for
no
comfort
is
greater
and
no
happiness
is
sweeter
than
spiritual
comprehension
of
the
divine
teachings
if
a
man
understands
the
real
meaning
of
a
poets
verses
such
as
those
of
shakespeare
he
is
pleased
and
rejoiced
how
much
greater
his
joy
and
pleasure
when
he
perceives
the
reality

i
pray
that
the
divine
blessings
may
descend
upon
you
day
by
day
that
your
hearts
may
be
opened
to
perceive
the
inner
significances
of
the
word
of
god
there
is
no
fruit
in
knowing
the
mere
letters
of
the
book
most
of
the
jews
had
memorized
the
texts
of
the
old
testament
and
repeated
them
night
and
day
but
inasmuch
as
they
were
ignorant
of
the
meanings
they
were
deprived
of
the
bounties
of
christ
i
pray
that
you
may
be
quickened
by
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
and
illumined
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
truth
may
you
be
favored
with
heavenly
blessings
in
the
threshold
of
god
and
attain
to
eternal
life
this
is
my
prayer
may
god
bless
and
enlighten
you

reflecting
a
high
degree
of

one
of
which
is
a
proof
in
himself
they
will
say
to
others
come
and
witness
the
conduct
of
these
souls

discover
the
foundations
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
firmly
implanted
within
them
what
greater
proof
can
there
be
than
these
people
that
the
message
of
bahaullah
is
truth
and
reality
it
is
my
hope
that
each
one
of
you
shall
be
a
herald
of
god

the
evidences
of
his

in
words
deeds

thoughts

utterances
be
a
witness
that
you
are
of
the
kingdom
of
bahaullah
these
are
the
duties
enjoined
upon
you
by
bahaullah
bahaullah
endured
the
greatest
hardships
he
found
neither
rest
by
night
nor
peace
by
day
he
was
constantly
under
the
stress
of
great
calamitynow
in
prison
now
in
chains
now
threatened
by
the
sworduntil
finally
he
broke
the
cage
of
captivity
left
this
mortal
world
and
ascended
to
the
heaven
of
god
he
endured
all
these
tribulations
for
our
sakes
and
suffered
these
deprivations
that
we
might
attain
the
bestowals
of
divine
bounty
therefore
we
must
be
faithful
to
him
and
turn
away
from
our
own
selfish
desires
and
fancies
in
order
that
we
may
accomplish
that
which
is
required
of
us
by
our
lord
it
is
my
wish
that
you
shall
arise
to
live
according
to
these
teachings
and
exhortations
that
all
of
us
may
be
divinely
strengthened
enter
the
paradise
of
the
spiritual

diffuse
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
truth
cause
the
waves
of
this
most
great
ocean
to

that
this

may
be

notes
by
esther
foster
those
who
are
uninformed
of
the
world
of
reality
who
do
not
comprehend
existing
things
who
are
without
perception
of
the
inner
truth
of
creation
who
do
not
penetrate
the
real
mysteries
of
material
and
spiritual
phenomena
and
who
possess
only
a
superficial
idea
of
universal
life
and
being
are
but
embodiments
of
pure
ignorance
they
believe
only
that
which
they
have
heard
from
their
fathers
and
ancestors
of
themselves
they
have
no
hearing
no
sight
no
reason
no
intellect
they
rely
solely
upon
tradition
such
persons
imagine
that
the
dominion
of
god
is
an
accidental
dominion
or
kingdom
for
instance
they
believe
that
this
world
of
existence
was
created
six
or
seven
thousand
years
ago
as
if
god
did
not
reign
before
that
time
and
had
no
creation
before
that
period
they
think
that
divinity
is
accidental
for
to
them
divinity
is
dependent
upon
existing
things
whereas
in
reality
as
long
as
there
has
been
a
god
there
has
been
a
creation
as
long
as
there
has
been
light
there
have
been
recipients
of
that
light
for
light
cannot
become
manifest
unless
those
things
which
perceive
and
appreciate
it
exist
the
world
of
divinity
presupposes
creation
presupposes
recipients
of
bounty
presupposes
the
existence
of
worlds
no
divinity
can
be
conceived
as
separate
from
creation
for
otherwise
it
would
be
like
imagining
an
empire
without
a
people
a
king
must
needs
have
a
kingdom
must
needs
have
an
army
and
subjects
is
it
possible
to
be
a
king
and
have
no
country
no
army
no
subjects
this
is
an
absurdity
if
we
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
no
country
no
army
and
no
subjects
how
then
could
there
have
been
a
king
and
ruler
for
these
things
are
essential
to
a
king
consequently
just
as
the
reality
of
divinity
never
had
a
beginningthat
is
god
has
ever
been
a
creator
god
has
ever
been
a
provider
god
has
ever
been
a
quickener
god
has
ever
been
a
bestowerso
there
never
has
been
a
time
when
the
attributes
of
god
have
not
had
expression
the
sun
is
the
sun
because
of
its
rays
because
of
its
heat
were
we
to
conceive
of
a
time
when
there
was
a
sun
without
heat
and
light
it
would
imply
that
there
had
been
no
sun
at
all
and
that
it
became
the
sun
afterward
so
likewise
if
we
say
there
was
a
time
when
god
had
no
creation
or
created
beings
a
time
when
there
were
no
recipients
of
his
bounties
and
that
his
names
and
attributes
had
not
been
manifested
this
would
be
equivalent
to
a
complete
denial
of
divinity
for
it
would
mean
that
divinity
is
accidental
to
explain
it
still
more
clearly
if
we
think
that
fifty
thousand
years
ago
or
one
hundred
thousand
years
ago
there
was
no
creation
that
there
were
then
no
worlds
no
human
beings
no
animals
this
thought
of
ours
would
mean
that
previous
to
that
period
there
was
no
divinity
if
we
should
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
a
king
but
there
were
no
subjects
no
army
no
country
for
him
to
rule
over
it
would
really
be
asserting
that
there
was
a
time
when
no
king
existed
and
that
the
king
is
accidental
it
is
therefore
evident
that
inasmuch
as
the
reality
of
divinity
is
without
a
beginning
creation
is
also
without
a
beginning
this
is
as
clear
as
the
sun
when
we
contemplate
this
vast
machinery
of
omnipresent
power
perceive
this
illimitable
space
and
its
innumerable
worlds
it
will
become
evident
to
us
that
the
lifetime
of
this
infinite
creation
is
more
than
six
thousand
years
nay
it
is
very
very
ancient
notwithstanding
this
we
read
in
genesis
in
the
old
testament
that
the
lifetime
of
creation
is
but
six
thousand
years
this
has
an
inner
meaning
and
significance
it
is
not
to
be
taken
literally
for
instance
it
is
said
in
the
old
testament
that
certain
things
were
created
in
the
first
day
the
narrative
shows
that
at
that
time
the
sun
was
not
yet
created
how
could
we
conceive
of
a
day
if
no
sun
existed
in
the
heavens
for
the
day
depends
upon
the
light
of
the
sun
inasmuch
as
the
sun
had
not
been
made
how
could
the
first
day
be
realized
therefore
these
statements
have
significances
other
than
literal
to
be
brief
our
purpose
is
to
show
that
the
divine
sovereignty
the
kingdom
of
god
is
an
ancient
sovereignty
that
it
is
not
an
accidental
sovereignty
just
as
a
kingdom
presupposes
the
existence
of
subjects
of
an
army
of
a
country
for
otherwise
the
state
of
dominion
authority
and
kingdom
cannot
be
conceived
of
therefore
if
we
should
imagine
that
the
creation
is
accidental
we
would
be
forced
to
admit
that
the
creator
is
accidental
whereas
the
divine
bounty
is
ever
flowing
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
truth
are
continuously
shining
no
cessation
is
possible
to
the
divine
bounty
just
as
no
cessation
is
possible
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
this
is
clear
and
obvious
thus
there
have
been
many
holy
manifestations
of
god
one
thousand
years
ago
two
hundred
thousand
years
ago
one
million
years
ago
the
bounty
of
god
was
flowing
the
radiance
of
god
was
shining
the
dominion
of
god
was
existing
why
do
these
holy
manifestations
of
god
appear
what
is
the
wisdom
and
purpose
of
their
coming
what
is
the
outcome
of
their
mission
it
is
evident
that
human
personality
appears
in
two
aspects
the
image
or
likeness
of
god
and
the
aspect
of
satan
the
human
reality
stands
between
these
two
the
divine
and
the
satanic
it
is
manifest
that
beyond
this
material
body
man
is
endowed
with
another
reality
which
is
the
world
of
exemplars
constituting
the
heavenly
body
of
man
in
speaking
man
says
i
saw
i
spoke
i
went
who
is
this
i
it
is
obvious
that
this
i
is
different
from
this
body
it
is
clear
that
when
man
is
thinking
it
is
as
though
he
were
consulting
with
some
other
person
with
whom
is
he
consulting
it
is
evident
that
it
is
another
reality
or
one
aside
from
this
body
with
whom
he
enters
into
consultation
when
he
thinks
shall
i
do
this
work
or
not
what
will
be
the
result
of
my
doing
this
or
when
he
questions
the
other
reality
what
is
the
objection
to
this
work
if
i
do
it
and
then
that
reality
in
man
communicates
its
opinion
to
him
concerning
the
point
at
issue
therefore
that
reality
in
man
is
clearly
and
obviously
other
than
his
bodyan
ego
with
which
man
enters
into
consultation
and
whose
opinion
man
seeks
often
a
man
makes
up
his
mind
positively
about
a
matter
for
instance
he
determines
to
undertake
a
journey
then
he
thinks
it
overthat
is
he
consults
his
inner
realityand
finally
concludes
that
he
will
give
up
his
journey
what
has
happened
why
did
he
abandon
his
original
purpose
it
is
evident
that
he
has
consulted
his
inner
reality
which
expresses
to
him
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
journey
therefore
he
defers
to
that
reality
and
changes
his
original
intention
furthermore
man
sees
in
the
world
of
dreams
he
travels
in
the
east
he
travels
in
the
west
although
his
body
is
stationary
his
body
is
here
it
is
that
reality
in
him
which
makes
the
journey
while
the
body
sleeps
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
reality
exists
other
than
the
outward
physical
reality
again
for
instance
a
person
is
dead
is
buried
in
the
ground
afterward
you
see
him
in
the
world
of
dreams
and
speak
with
him
although
his
body
is
interred
in
the
earth
who
is
the
person
you
see
in
your
dreams
talk
to
and
who
also
speaks
with
you
this
again
proves
that
there
is
another
reality
different
from
the
physical
one
which
dies
and
is
buried
thus
it
is
certain
that
in
man
there
is
a
reality
which
is
not
the
physical
body
sometimes
the
body
becomes
weak
but
that
other
reality
is
in
its
own
normal
state
the
body
goes
to
sleep
becomes
as
one
dead
but
that
reality
is
moving
about
comprehending
things
expressing
them
and
is
even
conscious
of
itself
this
other
and
inner
reality
is
called
the
heavenly
body
the
ethereal
form
which
corresponds
to
this
body
this
is
the
conscious
reality
which
discovers
the
inner
meaning
of
things
for
the
outer
body
of
man
does
not
discover
anything
the
inner
ethereal
reality
grasps
the
mysteries
of
existence
discovers
scientific
truths
and
indicates
their
technical
application
it
discovers
electricity
produces
the
telegraph
the
telephone
and
opens
the
door
to
the
world
of
arts
if
the
outer
material
body
did
this
the
animal
would
likewise
be
able
to
make
scientific
and
wonderful
discoveries
for
the
animal
shares
with
man
all
physical
powers
and
limitations
what
then
is
that
power
which
penetrates
the
realities
of
existence
and
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
animal
it
is
the
inner
reality
which
comprehends
things
throws
light
upon
the
mysteries
of
life
and
being
discovers
the
heavenly
kingdom
unseals
the
mysteries
of
god
and
differentiates
man
from
the
brute
of
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
we
have
before
indicated
this
human
reality
stands
between
the
higher
and
the
lower
in
man
between
the
world
of
the
animal
and
the
world
of
divinity
when
the
animal
proclivity
in
man
becomes
predominant
he
sinks
even
lower
than
the
brute
when
the
heavenly
powers
are
triumphant
in
his
nature
he
becomes
the
noblest
and
most
superior
being
in
the
world
of
creation
all
the
imperfections
found
in
the
animal
are
found
in
man
in
him
there
is
antagonism
hatred
and
selfish
struggle
for
existence
in
his
nature
lurk
jealousy
revenge
ferocity
cunning
hypocrisy
greed
injustice
and
tyranny
so
to
speak
the
reality
of
man
is
clad
in
the
outer
garment
of
the
animal
the
habiliments
of
the
world
of
nature
the
world
of
darkness
imperfections
and
unlimited
baseness
on
the
other
hand
we
find
in
him
justice
sincerity
faithfulness
knowledge
wisdom
illumination
mercy
and
pity
coupled
with
intellect
comprehension
the
power
to
grasp
the
realities
of
things
and
the
ability
to
penetrate
the
truths
of
existence
all
these
great
perfections
are
to
be
found
in
man
therefore
we
say
that
man
is
a
reality
which
stands
between
light
and
darkness
from
this
standpoint
his
nature
is
threefold
animal
human
and
divine
the
animal
nature
is
darkness
the
heavenly
is
light
in
light
the
holy
manifestations
of
god
come
into
the
world
to
dispel
the
darkness
of
the
animal
or
physical
nature
of
man
to
purify
him
from
his
imperfections
in
order
that
his
heavenly
and
spiritual
nature
may
become
quickened
his
divine
qualities
awakened
his
perfections
visible
his
potential
powers
revealed
and
all
the
virtues
of
the
world
of
humanity
latent
within
him
may
come
to
life
these
holy
manifestations
of
god
are
the
educators
and
trainers
of
the
world
of
existence
the
teachers
of
the
world
of
humanity
they
liberate
man
from
the
darkness
of
the
world
of
nature
deliver
him
from
despair
error
ignorance
imperfections
and
all
evil
qualities
they
clothe
him
in
the
garment
of
perfections
and
exalted
virtues
men
are
ignorant
the
manifestations
of
god
make
them
wise
they
are
animalistic
the
manifestations
make
them
human
they
are
savage
and
cruel
the
manifestations
lead
them
into
kingdoms
of
light
and
love
they
are
unjust
the
manifestations
cause
them
to
become
just
man
is
selfish
they
sever
him
from
self
and
desire
man
is
haughty
they
make
him
meek
humble
and
friendly
he
is
earthly
they
make
him
heavenly
men
are
material
the
manifestations
transform
them
into
divine
semblance
they
are
immature
children
the
manifestations
develop
them
into
maturity
man
is
poor
they
endow
him
with
wealth
man
is
base
treacherous
and
mean
the
manifestations
of
god
uplift
him
into
dignity
nobility
and
loftiness
these
holy
manifestations
liberate
the
world
of
humanity
from
the
imperfections
which
beset
it
and
cause
men
to
appear
in
the
beauty
of
heavenly
perfections
were
it
not
for
the
coming
of
these
holy
manifestations
of
god
all
mankind
would
be
found
on
the
plane
of
the
animal
they
would
remain
darkened
and
ignorant
like
those
who
have
been
denied
schooling
and
who
never
had
a
teacher
or
trainer
undoubtedly
such
unfortunates
will
continue
in
their
condition
of
need
and
deprivation
if
the
mountains
hills
and
plains
of
the
material
world
are
left
wild
and
uncultivated
under
the
rule
of
nature
they
will
remain
an
unbroken
wilderness
no
fruitful
tree
to
be
found
anywhere
upon
them
a
true
cultivator
changes
this
forest
and
jungle
into
a
garden
training
its
trees
to
bring
forth
fruit
and
causing
flowers
to
grow
in
place
of
thorns
and
thistles
the
holy
manifestations
are
the
ideal
gardeners
of
human
souls
the
divine
cultivators
of
human
hearts
the
world
of
existence
is
but
a
jungle
of
disorder
and
confusion
a
state
of
nature
producing
nothing
but
fruitless
useless
trees
the
ideal
gardeners
train
these
wild
uncultivated
human
trees
cause
them
to
become
fruitful
water
and
cultivate
them
day
by
day
so
that
they
adorn
the
world
of
existence
and
continue
to
flourish
in
the
utmost
beauty
consequently
we
cannot
say
that
the
divine
bounty
has
ceased
that
the
glory
of
divinity
is
exhausted
or
the
sun
of
truth
sunk
into
eternal
sunset
into
that
darkness
which
is
not
followed
by
light
into
that
night
which
is
not
followed
by
a
sunrise
and
dawn
into
that
death
which
is
not
followed
by
life
into
that
error
which
is
not
followed
by
truth
is
it
conceivable
that
the
sun
of
reality
should
sink
into
an
eternal
darkness
no
the
sun
was
created
in
order
that
it
may
shed
light
upon
the
world
and
train
all
the
kingdoms
of
existence
how
then
can
the
ideal
sun
of
truth
the
word
of
god
set
forever
for
this
would
mean
the
cessation
of
the
divine
bounty
and
the
divine
bounty
by
its
very
nature
is
continuous
and
ceaseless
its
sun
is
ever
shining
its
cloud
is
ever
producing
rain
its
breezes
are
ever
blowing
its
bestowals
are
allcomprehending
its
gifts
are
ever
perfect
consequently
we
must
always
anticipate
always
be
hopeful
and
pray
to
god
that
he
will
send
unto
us
his
holy
manifestations
in
their
most
perfect
might
with
the
divine
penetrative
power
of
his
word
so
that
these
heavenly
ones
may
be
distinguished
above
all
other
beings
in
every
respect
in
every
attribute
just
as
the
glorious
sun
is
distinguished
above
all
stars
although
the
stars
are
scintillating
and
brilliant
the
sun
is
superior
to
them
in
luminous
effulgence
similarly
these
holy
divine
manifestations
are
and
must
always
be
distinguished
above
all
other
beings
in
every
attribute
of
glory
and
perfection
in
order
that
it
may
be
proven
that
the
manifestation
is
the
true
teacher
and
real
trainer
that
he
is
the
sun
of
truth
endowed
with
a
supreme
splendor
and
reflecting
the
beauty
of
god
otherwise
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
train
one
human
individual
and
then
after
training
him
believe
in
him
and
accept
him
as
the
holy
manifestation
of
divinity
the
real
manifestation
of
god
must
be
endowed
with
divine
knowledge
and
not
dependent
upon
learning
acquired
in
schools
he
must
be
the
educator
not
the
educated
his
standard
intuition
instead
of
tuition
he
must
be
perfect
and
not
imperfect
great
and
glorious
instead
of
being
weak
and
impotent
he
must
be
wealthy
in
the
riches
of
the
spiritual
world
and
not
indigent
in
a
word
the
holy
divine
manifestation
of
god
must
be
distinguished
above
all
others
of
mankind
in
every
aspect
and
qualification
in
order
that
he
may
be
able
to
train
effectively
the
human
body
politic
eliminate
the
darkness
enshrouding
the
human
world
uplift
humanity
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
kingdom
be
able
through
the
penetrative
power
of
his
word
to
promote
and
spread
broadcast
the
beneficent
message
of
universal
peace
among
men
bring
about
the
unification
of
mankind
in
religious
belief
through
a
manifest
divine
power
harmonize
all
sects
and
denominations
and
convert
all
native
lands
and
nationalities
into
one
native
land
and
fatherland
it
is
our
hope
that
the
bounties
of
god
will
encompass
us
all
the
gifts
of
the
divine
become
manifest
the
lights
of
the
sun
of
truth
illumine
our
eyes
inspire
our
hearts
convey
to
our
souls
cheerful
glad
tidings
of
god
cause
our
thoughts
to
become
lofty
and
our
efforts
to
be
productive
of
glorious
results
in
a
word
it
is
our
hope
that
we
may
attain
to
that
which
is
the
summit
of
human
aspirations
and
wishes
i
have
been
in
america
nine
months
and
have
traveled
to
all
the
large
cities
speaking
before
various
assemblages
proclaiming
to
them
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
summoning
all
to
union
harmony
and
oneness
i
have
indeed
received
the
greatest
kindness
from
the
american
people
i
look
upon
them
as
a
noble
nation
capable
of
every
perfection
tomorrow
i
am
going
away
to
europe
and
now
i
bid
farewell
to
you
all
seeking
for
you
the
divine
mercy
the
eternal
glory
and
everlasting
life
and
i
pray
that
you
may
attain
the
highest
station
of
humanity
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
this
meeting
my
happiness
is
great
i
shall
never
forget
you
you
shall
always
live
in
my
thought
i
shall
always
pray
and
supplicate
before
the
kingdom
of
god
and
seek
heavenly
blessings
for
you

notes
by
mariam
haney
this
is
my
last
meeting
with
you
for
now
i
am
on
the
ship
ready
to
sail
away
these
are
my
final
words
of
exhortation
i
have
repeatedly
summoned
you
to
the
cause
of
the
unity
of
the
world
of
humanity
announcing
that
all
mankind
are
the
servants
of
the
same
god
that
god
is
the
creator
of
all
he
is
the
provider
and
lifegiver
all
are
equally
beloved
by
him
and
are
his
servants
upon
whom
his
mercy
and
compassion
descend
therefore
you
must
manifest
the
greatest
kindness
and
love
toward
the
nations
of
the
world
setting
aside
fanaticism
abandoning
religious
national
and
racial
prejudice
the
earth
is
one
native
land
one
home
and
all
mankind
are
the
children
of
one
father
god
has
created
them
and
they
are
the
recipients
of
his
compassion
therefore
if
anyone
offends
another
he
offends
god
it
is
the
wish
of
our
heavenly
father
that
every
heart
should
rejoice
and
be
filled
with
happiness
that
we
should
live
together
in
felicity
and
joy
the
obstacle
to
human
happiness
is
racial
or
religious
prejudice
the
competitive
struggle
for
existence
and
inhumanity
toward
each
other
your
eyes
have
been
illumined
your
ears
are
attentive
your
hearts
knowing
you
must
be
free
from
prejudice
and
fanaticism
beholding
no
differences
between
the
races
and
religions
you
must
look
to
god
for
he
is
the
real
shepherd
and
all
humanity
are
his
sheep
he
loves
them
and
loves
them
equally
as
this
is
true
should
the
sheep
quarrel
among
themselves
they
should
manifest
gratitude
and
thankfulness
to
god
and
the
best
way
to
thank
god
is
to
love
one
another
beware
lest
ye
offend
any
heart
lest
ye
speak
against
anyone
in
his
absence
lest
ye
estrange
yourselves
from
the
servants
of
god
you
must
consider
all
his
servants
as
your
own
family
and
relations
direct
your
whole
effort
toward
the
happiness
of
those
who
are
despondent
bestow
food
upon
the
hungry
clothe
the
needy
and
glorify
the
humble
be
a
helper
to
every
helpless
one
and
manifest
kindness
to
your
fellow
creatures
in
order
that
ye
may
attain
the
good
pleasure
of
god
this
is
conducive
to
the
illumination
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
eternal
felicity
for
yourselves
i
seek
from
god
everlasting
glory
in
your
behalf
therefore
this
is
my
prayer
and
exhortation
consider
what
is
happening
in
the
balkans
human
blood
is
being
shed
properties
are
destroyed
possessions
pillaged
cities
and
villages
devastated
a
worldenkindling
fire
is
astir
in
the
balkans
god
has
created
men
to
love
each
other
but
instead
they
kill
each
other
with
cruelty
and
bloodshed
god
has
created
them
that
they
may
cooperate
and
mingle
in
accord
but
instead
they
ravage
plunder
and
destroy
in
the
carnage
of
battle
god
has
created
them
to
be
the
cause
of
mutual
felicity
and
peace
but
instead
discord
lamentation
and
anguish
rise
from
the
hearts
of
the
innocent
and
afflicted
as
to
you
your
efforts
must
be
lofty
exert
yourselves
with
heart
and
soul
so
that
perchance
through
your
efforts
the
light
of
universal
peace
may
shine
and
this
darkness
of
estrangement
and
enmity
may
be
dispelled
from
amongst
men
that
all
men
may
become
as
one
family
and
consort
together
in
love
and
kindness
that
the
east
may
assist
the
west
and
the
west
give
help
to
the
east
for
all
are
the
inhabitants
of
one
planet
the
people
of
one
original
native
land
and
the
flocks
of
one
shepherd
consider
how
the
prophets
who
have
been
sent
the
great
souls
who
have
appeared
and
the
sages
who
have
arisen
in
the
world
have
exhorted
mankind
to
unity
and
love
this
has
been
the
essence
of
their
mission
and
teaching
this
has
been
the
goal
of
their
guidance
and
message
the
prophets
saints
seers
and
philosophers
have
sacrificed
their
lives
in
order
to
establish
these
principles
and
teachings
amongst
men
consider
the
heedlessness
of
the
world
for
notwithstanding
the
efforts
and
sufferings
of
the
prophets
of
god
the
nations
and
peoples
are
still
engaged
in
hostility
and
fighting
notwithstanding
the
heavenly
commandments
to
love
one
another
they
are
still
shedding
each
others
blood
how
heedless
and
ignorant
are
the
people
of
the
world
how
gross
the
darkness
which
envelops
them
although
they
are
the
children
of
a
compassionate
god
they
continue
to
live
and
act
in
opposition
to
his
will
and
good
pleasure
god
is
loving
and
kind
to
all
men
and
yet
they
show
the
utmost
enmity
and
hatred
toward
each
other
god
is
the
giver
of
life
to
them
and
yet
they
constantly
seek
to
destroy
life
god
blesses
and
protects
their
homes
they
rage
sack
and
destroy
each
others
homes
consider
their
ignorance
and
heedlessness
your
duty
is
of
another
kind
for
you
are
informed
of
the
mysteries
of
god
your
eyes
are
illumined
your
ears
are
quickened
with
hearing
you
must
therefore
look
toward
each
other
and
then
toward
mankind
with
the
utmost
love
and
kindness
you
have
no
excuse
to
bring
before
god
if
you
fail
to
live
according
to
his
command
for
you
are
informed
of
that
which
constitutes
the
good
pleasure
of
god
you
have
heard
his
commandments
and
precepts
you
must
therefore
be
kind
to
all
men
you
must
even
treat
your
enemies
as
your
friends
you
must
consider
your
evilwishers
as
your
wellwishers
those
who
are
not
agreeable
toward
you
must
be
regarded
as
those
who
are
congenial
and
pleasant
so
that
perchance
this
darkness
of
disagreement
and
conflict
may
disappear
from
amongst
men
and
the
light
of
the
divine
may
shine
forth
so
that
the
orient
may
be
illumined
and
the
occident
filled
with
fragrance
nay
so
that
the
east
and
west
may
embrace
each
other
in
love
and
deal
with
one
another
in
sympathy
and
affection
until
man
reaches
this
high
station
the
world
of
humanity
shall
not
find
rest
and
eternal
felicity
shall
not
be
attained
but
if
man
lives
up
to
these
divine
commandments
this
world
of
earth
shall
be
transformed
into
the
world
of
heaven
and
this
material
sphere
shall
be
converted
into
a
paradise
of
glory
it
is
my
hope
that
you
may
become
successful
in
this
high
calling
so
that
like
brilliant
lamps
you
may
cast
light
upon
the
world
of
humanity
and
quicken
and
stir
the
body
of
existence
like
unto
a
spirit
of
life
this
is
eternal
glory
this
is
everlasting
felicity
this
is
immortal
life
this
is
heavenly
attainment
this
is
being
created
in
the
image
and
likeness
of
god
and
unto
this
i
call
you
praying
to
god
to
strengthen
and
bless
you

some

in

of
the
cities
of
these

up
to
this
date
people
are
not
yet
illumined
with
the
lights
of
the

and
are
not

therefore
whenever
it

you
hasten
ye
to
those
cities
and
shine
forth
like
unto
the
stars
with
the
light
of
the
most
great
guidance
god
says
in
the
glorious
quran
the
soil
was
black
and
dried
then
we
caused
the
rain
to
descend
upon
it
and
immediately
it
became
green
verdant
and
every
kind
of
plant
sprouted
up
luxuriantly
in
other
words
he
says
the
earth
is
black
but
when
the
spring
showers
descend
upon
it
that
black
soil
is
quickened
and
variegated
flowers
are
pushed
forth
this
means
the
souls
of
humanity
belonging
to
the
world
of
nature
are
black
like
unto
the
soil
but
when
the
heavenly
outpourings
descend
and
the
radiant
effulgences
appear
the
hearts
are
resuscitated
are
liberated
from
the
darkness
of
nature
and
the
flowers
of
divine
mysteries
grow
and
become
luxuriant
consequently
man
must
become
the
cause
of
the
illumination
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
propagate
the
holy
teachings
revealed
in
the
sacred
books
through
the
divine
inspiration
it
is
stated
in
the
blessed
gospel
travel
ye
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
west
and
enlighten
the
people
with
the
light
of
the
most
great
guidance
so
that
they
may
take
a
portion
and
share
of
eternal
life
praise
be
to
god
that
the
northeastern
states
are
in
the
utmost
capacity
because
the
ground
is
rich
the
rain
of
the
divine
outpouring
is
descending
now
you
must
become
heavenly
farmers
and
scatter
pure
seeds
in
the
prepared
soil
the
harvest
of
every
other
seed
is
limited
but
the
bounty
and
the
blessing
of
the
seed
of
the
divine
teachings
is
unlimited
throughout
the
coming
centuries
and
cycles
many
harvests
will
be
gathered
consider
the
work
of
former
generations
during
the
lifetime
of
jesus
christ
the
believing
firm
souls
were
few
and
numbered
but
the
heavenly
blessings
descended
so
plentifully
that
in
a
number
of
years
countless
souls
entered
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
gospel
god
has
said
in
the
quran
one
grain
will
bring
forth
seven
sheaves
and
every
sheaf
shall
contain
one
hundred
grains
in
other
words
one
grain
will
become
seven
hundred
and
if
god
so
wills
he
will
double
these
also
it
has
often
happened
that
one
blessed
soul
has
become
the
cause
of
the
guidance
of
a
nation
now
we
must
not
consider
our
ability
and
capacity
nay
rather
we
must
fix
our
gaze
upon
the
favors
and
bounties
of
god
in
these
days
who
has
made
of
the
drop
a
sea
and
of
the
atom
a
sun
upon
you
be
greeting
and
praise

to
the

o
ye
heralds
of
the
kingdom
of
god
a
few
days
ago
an
epistle
was
written
to
those
divine
believers
but
because
these
days
are
the
days
of
nawruz
you
have
come
to
my
mind
and
i
am
sending
you
this
greeting
for
this
glorious
feast
all
the
days
are
blessed
but
this
feast
is
the
national
fete
of
persia
the
persians
have
been
holding
it
for
several
thousand
years
past
in
reality
every
day
which
man
passes
in
the
mention
of
god
the
diffusion
of
the
fragrances
of
god
and
calling
the
people
to
the
kingdom
of
god
that
day
is
his
feast
praise
be
to
god
that
you
are
occupied
in
the
service
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
are
engaged
in
the
promulgation
of
the
religion
of
god
by
day
and
by
night
therefore
all
your
days
are
feast
days
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
assistance
and
the
bestowal
of
god
shall
descend
upon

georgia
florida
alabama
mississippi
tennessee
kentucky
louisiana
arkansas

and

consequently
you
must
either
go
yourselves
or
send
a
number
of
blessed
souls
to
those
states
so
that
they
may
guide
the
people
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
one
of
the
holy
manifestations
addressing
a
believing
soul
has
said
that
if
a
person
become
the
cause
of
the
illumination
of
one
soul
it
is
better
than
a
boundless
treasury
o
ali
if
god
guide
through
thee
one
soul
it
is
better
for
thee
than
all
the
riches
again
he
says
direct
us
to
the
straight
path
that
is
show
us
the
right
road
it
is
also
mentioned
in
the
gospel
travel
ye
to
all
parts
of
the
world
and
give
ye
the
glad
tidings
of
the
appearance
of
the
kingdom
of

in
brief
i
hope

will
display
in
this
respect
the
greatest
effort
and
magnanimity
it
is
assured
that
you
will
become
assisted
and
confirmed
a
person
declaring
the
glad
tidings
of
the
appearance
of
the
realities
and
significances
of
the
kingdom
is
like
unto
a
farmer
who
scatters
pure
seeds
in
the
rich
soil
the
spring
cloud
will
pour
upon
them
the
rain
of
bounty
and
unquestionably
the
station
of
the
farmer
will
be
raised
in
the
estimation
of
the
lord
of
the
village
and
many
harvests
will
be
gathered
therefore
ye
friends
of
god
appreciate
ye
the
value
of
this
time
and
be
ye
engaged
in
the
sowing
of
the

for
some
time
past
correspondence
has
been

and
this
has
been
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of

and
receiving
letters
but
because
at
present
a
number
of
facilities
are
obtainable
therefore
i
am
engaged
in
writing
you
this
brief
epistle
so
that
my
heart
and
soul
may
obtain
joy
and
fragrance
through
the
remembrance
of

continually
this

supplicates
and
entreats
at
the
threshold
of
his

and
begs

be

are
found
who
are
associating
with

in
the

and
night
they
have
no
other
intention
save
the
diffusion
of
the
fragrances
of
god
they
have
no
other
hope
except
the
promotion
of
the
heavenly
teachings
like
the
candles
they
are
burning
with
the
light
of
the
love
of

and
like
thankful

of
the

in
the
states
of
indiana
iowa
missouri
north
dakota
south
dakota
nebraska
and
kansas
few
of
the
believers
exist
so
far
the
summons
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
proclamation
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
has
not
been
made
in
these
states
systematically
and
enthusiastically
blessed
souls
and
detached
teachers
have
not
traveled
through
these
parts
repeatedly
therefore
these
states
are
still
in
a
state
of
heedlessness
through
the
efforts
of
the
friends
of
god
souls
must
be
likewise
enkindled
in
these
states
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
and
attracted
to
the
kingdom
of
god
so
that
section
may
also
become
illumined
and
the
soul
imparting
breeze
of
the
rose
garden
of
the
kingdom
may
perfume
the
nostrils
of
the
inhabitants
therefore
if
it
is
possible
send
to
those
parts
teachers
who
are
severed
from
all
else
save
god
sanctified
and
pure
if
these
teachers
be
in
the
utmost
state
of
attraction
in
a
short
time
great
results
will
be
forthcoming
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
kingdom
are
like
unto
the
real
farmers
through
whichever
state
or
country
they
pass
they
display
selfsacrifice
and
sow
divine
seeds
from
that
seed
harvests
are
produced
on
this
subject
it
is
revealed
in
the
glorious
gospel
when
the
pure
seeds
are
scattered
in
the
good
ground
heavenly
blessing
and
benediction
is
obtained
i
hope
that
you
may
become
assisted
and
confirmed
and
never
lose
courage
in
the
promotion
of
the
divine
teachings
day
by

may
you
add

i
have
no

praying
from
the
depth
of
my

in

begging
for

confirmation
from
the

and
supplicating
the
direct

i
am
hopeful
from
the
favors
of
his
highness
the
lord
of

that
the

during
such
a

may
become

upon

praiseworthy

may

conducive

throughout
all

although
in
some
of
the
western
states
like
california
oregon
washington
and
colorado
the
fragrances
of
holiness
are
diffused
numerous
souls
have
taken
a
share
and
a
portion
from
the
fountain
of
everlasting
life
they
have
obtained
heavenly
benediction
have
drunk
an
overflowing
cup
from
the
wine
of
the

have
hearkened
to
the
melody
of
the
supreme
concourseyet
in
the

of
new
mexico
wyoming
montana
idaho
utah
arizona
and

the
lamp
of
the
love
of
god
is
not
ignited
in
a
befitting
and
behooving
manner
and
the
call
of
the
kingdom
of
god
has
not
been
raised
now
if
it
is
possible
show
ye
an
effort
in
this
direction
either
travel
yourselves
personally
throughout
those
states
or
choose
others
and
send
them
so
that
they
may
teach
the
souls
for
the
present
those
states
are
like
unto
dead
bodies
they
must
breathe
into
them
the
breath
of
life
and
bestow
upon
them
a
heavenly
spirit
like
unto
the
stars
they
must
shine
in
that
horizon
and
thus
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
may
also
illumine
those
states
god
says
in
the
great
quran
verily
god
is
the
helper
of
those
who
have
believed
he
will
lead
them
from
darkness
into
light
this
means
god
loves
the
believers
consequently
he
will
deliver
them
from
darkness
and
bring
them
into
the
world
of
light
it
is
also
recorded
in
the
blessed
gospel
travel
ye
throughout
the
world
and
call
ye
the
people
to
the
kingdom
of
god
now
this
is
the
time
that
you
may
arise
and
perform
this
most
great
service
and
become
the
cause
of
the
guidance
of
innumerable
souls
thus
through
this
superhuman
service
the
rays
of
peace
and
conciliation
may
illumine
and
enlighten
all
the
regions
and
the
world
of
humanity
may
find
peace
and
composure
during
my
stay
in
america
i
cried
out
in
every
meeting
and
summoned
the
people
to
the
propagation
of
the
ideals
of
universal
peace
i
said
plainly
that
the
continent
of
europe
had
become
like
unto
an
arsenal
and
its
conflagration
was
dependent
upon
one
spark
and
that
in
the
coming
years
or
within
two
years
all
that
which
is
recorded
in
the
revelation
of
john
and
the
book
of
daniel
would
become
fulfilled
and
come
to
pass
this
matter
in
all
probability
was
published
in
the
san
francisco
bulletin
october
you
may
refer
to
it
so
that
the
truth
may
become
clear
and
manifest
thus
ye
may
fully
realize
that
this
is
the
time
for
the
diffusion
of
the
fragrances
the
magnanimity
of
man
must
be
heavenly
or
in
other
words
it
must
be
assisted
by
the
divine
confirmation
so
that

may
become
the

i
desire
for
you
eternal
success
and

and
beg
perfect

for
each

my
hope
for

that
each

may
shine
forth
like
unto
the
morning
star
from
the
horizon
of
the
world
and
in
this

of

become
a

producing
everlasting

and
results
therefore
i
direct
you
to
that
which
is
conducive
to
your
heavenly
confirmation
and
illumination
in
the
kingdom
of
god
it
is
this
alaska
is
a
vast
country
although
one
of
the
maidservants
of
the
merciful
has
hastened
to
those
parts
serving
as
a
librarian
in
the
public
library
and
according
to
her
ability
is
not
failing
in
teaching
the
cause
yet
the
call
of
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
yet
raised
through
that
spacious
territory
his
holiness
christ
says
travel
ye
to
the
east
and
to
the
west
of
the
world
and
summon
the
people
to
the
kingdom
of
god
hence
the
mercy
of
god
must
encompass
all
humanity
therefore
do
ye
not
think
it
permissible
to
leave
that
region
deprived
of
the
breezes
of
the
morn
of
guidance
consequently
strive
as
far
as
ye
are
able
to
send
to
those
parts
fluent
speakers
who
are
detached
from
aught
else
save
god
attracted
with
the
fragrances
of
god
and
sanctified
and
purified
from
all
desires
and
temptations
their
sustenance
and
food
must
consist
of
the
teachings
of
god
first
they
must
themselves
live
in
accordance
with
those
principles
then
guide
the
people
perchance
god
willing
the
lights
of
the
most
great
guidance
will
illuminate
that
country
and
the
breezes
of
the
rose
garden
of
the
love
of
god
will
perfume
the
nostrils
of
the
inhabitants
of
alaska
should
you
be
aided
to
render
such
a
service
rest
ye
assured
that
your
heads
shall
be
crowned
with
the
diadem
of
everlasting
sovereignty
and
at
the
threshold
of
oneness
you
will
become
the
favored
and
accepted
servants
likewise
the
republic
of
mexico
is
very
important
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
are
devoted
catholics
they
are
totally
unaware
of
the
reality
of
the
bible
the
gospel
and
the
new
divine
teachings
they
do
not
know
that
the
basis
of
the
religions
of
god
is
one
and
that
the
holy
manifestations
are
like
unto
the
sun
of
truth
rising
from
the
different
dawningplaces
those
souls
are
submerged
in
the
sea
of
dogmas
if
one
breath
of
life
be
blown
over
them
great
results
will
issue
therefrom
but
it
is
better
for
those
who
intend
to
go
to
mexico
to
teach
to
be
familiar
with
the
spanish
language
similarly
the
six
central
american
republics
situated
south
of
mexicoguatemala
honduras
salvador
nicaragua
costa
rica
panama
and
the
seventh
country
belize
or
british
honduras
the
teachers
going
to
those
parts
must
also
be
familiar
with
the
spanish
language
attach
great
importance
to
the
indigenous
population
of
america
for
these
souls
may
be
likened
unto
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
the
arabian
peninsula
who
prior
to
the
mission
of
muhammad
were
like
unto
savages
when
the
light
of
muhammad
shone
forth
in
their
midst
however
they
became
so
radiant
as
to
illumine
the
world
likewise
these
indians
should
they
be
educated
and
guided
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
will
become
so
illumined
as
to
enlighten
the
whole
world
all
the
above
countries
have
importance
but
especially
the
republic
of
panama
wherein
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
come
together
through
the
panama
canal
it
is
a
center
for
travel
and
passage
from
america
to
other
continents
of
the
world
and
in
the
future
it
will
gain
most
great
importance
likewise
the
islands
of
the
west
indies
such
as
cuba
haiti
puerto
rico
jamaica
the
islands
of
the
lesser
antilles
bahama
islands
even
the
small
watling
island
have
great
importance
especially
the
two
black
republics
haiti
and
santo
domingo
situated
in
the
cluster
of
the
greater
antilles
likewise
the
cluster
of
the
islands
of
bermuda
in
the
atlantic
ocean
have
importance
in
a
similar
way
the
republics
of
the
continent
of
south
americacolombia
ecuador
peru
brazil
british
guiana
dutch
guiana
french
guiana
bolivia
chile
argentina
uruguay
paraguay
venezuela
also
the
islands
to
the
north
east
and
west
of
south
america
such
as
falkland
islands
the
galapagos
juan
fernandez
tobago
and
trinidad
likewise
the
city
of
bahia
situated
on
the
eastern
shore
of
brazil
because
it
is
some
time
that
it
has
become
known
by
this
name
its
efficacy
will
be
most
potent
in
short
o
ye
believers
of
god
exalt
your
effort
and
magnify
your
aims
his
holiness
christ
says
blessed
are
the
poor
for
theirs
shall
be
the
kingdom
of
heaven
in
other
words
blessed
are
the
nameless
and
traceless
poor
for
they
are
the
leaders
of
mankind
likewise
it
is
said
in
the
quran
and
we
desire
to
show
favor
to
those
who
were
brought
low
in
the
land
and
to
make
them
spiritual
leaders
among
men
and
to
make
of
them
our
heirs
or
we
wish
to
grant
a
favor
to
the
impotent
souls
and
suffer
them
to
become
the
inheritors
of
the
messengers
and
prophets
now
is
the
time
for
you
to
divest
yourselves
of
the
garment
of
attachment
to
this
world
that
perisheth
to
be
wholly
severed
from
the
physical
world
become
heavenly
angels
and
travel
to
these
countries
i
swear
by
him
besides
whom
there
is
none
other
god
that
each
one
of
you
will
become
an
israfil
of
life
and
will
blow
the
breath
of
life
into
the
souls
of
others
upon
you
be
greeting
and
praise
supplication
o
thou
incomparable
god
o
thou
lord
of
the
kingdom
these
souls
are
thy
heavenly
army
assist
them
and
with
the
cohorts
of
the
supreme
concourse
make
them
victorious
so
that
each
one
of
them
may
become
like
unto
a
regiment
and
conquer
these
countries
through
the
love
of
god
and
the
illumination
of
divine
teachings
o
god
be
thou
their
supporter
and
their
helper
and
in
the
wilderness
the
mountain
the
valley
the
forests
the
prairies
and
the
seas
be
thou
their
confidantso
that
they
may
cry
out
through
the
power
of

at

to
the

he

praise

to
his

the
desired
one
that
ye
have
become
confirmed
in
the
promotion
of
divine
teachings
in
that
vast
continent
raised
the
call
of
the

of
god
in
that
region
and
announced
the
glad

of
the
manifestation

and
his

the
promised
one
thanks
be
unto
the
lord
that
ye
have

in
this
aim
this
is
purely
through
the
confirmations
of
the
lord
of
hosts
and
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
the
full
measure
of
your
success
is
as
yet
unrevealed
its
significance
still
unapprehended
erelong
ye
will
with
your
own
eyes
witness
how
brilliantly
every
one
of
you
even
as
a
shining
star
will
radiate
in
the
firmament
of
your
country
the
light
of
divine
guidance
and
will
bestow
upon
its
people
the
glory
of
an
everlasting
life
consider
the
station
and
the
confirmation
of
the
apostles
in
the
time
of
christ
was
not
known
and
no
one
looked
on
them
with
the
feeling
of
importancenay
rather
they
persecuted
and
ridiculed
them
later
on
it
became
evident
what
crowns
studded
with
the
brilliant
jewels
of
guidance
were
placed
on
the
heads
of
the
apostles
mary
magdalene
and
mary
the
mother
of
john
the
range
of
your
future
achievements
still
remains
undisclosed
i
fervently
hope
that
in
the
near
future
the
whole
earth
may
be
stirred
and
shaken
by
the
results
of
your
achievements
the
hope
therefore
which
abdulbaha
cherishes
for
you
is
that
the
same
success
which
has
attended
your
efforts
in
america
may
crown
your
endeavors
in
other
parts
of
the
world
that
through
you
the
fame
of
the
cause
of
god
may
be
diffused
throughout
the
east
and
the
west
and
the
advent
of
the
kingdom
of
the
lord
of
hosts
be
proclaimed
in
all
the
five
continents
of
the
globe
the
moment
this
divine
message
is
carried
forward
by
the
american
believers
from
the
shores
of
america
and
is
propagated
through
the
continents
of
europe
of
asia
of
africa
and
of
australasia
and
as
far
as
the
islands
of
the
pacific
this
community
will
find
itself
securely
established
upon
the
throne
of
an
everlasting
dominion
then
will
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
witness
that
this
community
is
spiritually
illumined
and
divinely
guided
then
will
the
whole
earth
resound
with
the
praises
of
its
majesty
and
greatness
a
party
speaking
their
languages
severed
holy
sanctified
and
filled
with
the
love
of
god
must
turn
their
faces
to
and
travel
through
the
three
great
island
groups
of
the
pacific
oceanpolynesia
micronesia
and
melanesia
and
the

attached

with

overflowing
with
the
love
of
god
with
tongues
commemorating
the
mention
of
god
with
eyes
turned
to
the
kingdom
of

they
must
deliver
the
glad

of
the
manifestation
of
the
lord
of

to
all
the
people
know
ye
of
a
certainty
that
whatever
gathering
ye
enter
the
waves
of
the
holy
spirit
are
surging
over
it
and
the
heavenly
grace
of
the
blessed
beauty
encompasseth
that
gathering
consider
ye
that
miss
agnes
alexander
the
daughter
of
the
kingdom
the
beloved
maidservant
of
the
blessed
perfection
traveled
alone
to
the
hawaiian
islands
to
the
island
of
honolulu
and
now
she
is
gaining
spiritual
victories
in
japan
reflect
ye
how
this
daughter
was
confirmed
in
the
hawaiian
islands
she
became
the
cause
of
the
guidance
of
a
gathering
of
people
likewise
miss
knobloch
traveled
alone
to
germany
to
what
a
great
extent
she
became
confirmed
therefore
know
ye
of
a
certainty
that
whosoever
arises
in
this
day
to
diffuse
the
divine
fragrances
the
cohorts
of
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
confirm
him
and
the
bestowals
and
the
favors
of
the
blessed
perfection
shall
encircle
him
o
that
i
could
travel
even
though
on
foot
and
in
the
utmost
poverty
to
these
regions
and
raising
the
call
of
ya
bahaulabha
in
cities
villages
mountains
deserts
and
oceans
promote
the
divine
teachings
this
alas
i
cannot
do
how
intensely
i
deplore
it
please
god
ye
may
achieve
it
at
this
time
in
the
hawaiian
islands
through
the
efforts
of
miss
alexander
a
number
of
souls
have
reached
the
shore
of
the
sea
of
faith
consider
ye
what
happiness
what
joy
is
this
i
declare
by
the
lord
of
hosts
that
had
this
respected
daughter
founded
an
empire
that
empire
would
not
have
been
so
great
for
this
sovereignty
is
eternal
sovereignty
and
this
glory
is
everlasting
glory
likewise
if
some
teachers
go
to
other
islands
and
other
parts
such
as
the
continent
of
australia
new
zealand
tasmania
also
to
japan
asiatic
russia
korea
french
indochina
siam
straits
settlements
india
ceylon
and
afghanistan
most
great
results
will
be
forthcoming
how
good
would
it
be
were
there
any
possibility
of
a
commission
composed
of
men
and
women
to
travel
together
through
china
and
japanso
that
this
bond
of
love
may
become
strengthened
and
through
this
going
and
coming
they
may
establish
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
summon
the
people
to
the
kingdom
of
god
and
spread
the
teachings
similarly
if
possible
they
should
travel
to
the
continent
of
africa
canary
islands
cape
verde
islands
madeira
islands
reunion
islands
st
helena
zanzibar
mauritius
etc
and
in
those
countries
summon
the
people
to
the
kingdom
of
god
and
raise
the
cry
of
ya
bahaulabha
they
must
also
upraise
the
flag
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
in
the
island
of
madagascar
books
and
pamphlets
must
be
either
translated
or
composed
in
the
languages
of
these
countries
and
islands
to
be
circulated
in
every
part
and
in
all
directions
it
is
said
that
in
south
africa
a
diamond
mine
is
discovered
although
this
mine
is
most
valuable
yet
after
all
it
is
stone
perchance
god
willing
the
mine
of
humanity
may
be
discovered
and
the
brilliant
pearls
of
the
kingdom
be
found
in
brief
this
worldconsuming
war
has
set
such
a
conflagration
to
the
hearts
that
no
word
can
describe
it
in
all
the
countries
of
the
world
the
longing
for
universal
peace
is
taking
possession
of
the
consciousness
of
men
there
is
not
a
soul
who
does
not
yearn
for
concord
and
peace
a
most
wonderful
state
of
receptivity
is
being
realized
this
is
through
the
consummate
wisdom
of
god
so
that
capacity
may
be
created
the
standard
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
be
upraised
and
the
fundamental
of
universal
peace
and
the
divine
principles
be
promoted
in
the
east
and
the
west
therefore
o
ye
believers
of
god
show
ye
an
effort
and
after
this
war
spread
ye
the
synopsis
of
the
divine
teachings
in
the
british
isles
france
germany
austriahungary
russia
italy
spain
belgium
switzerland

shetland

hebrides
and
orkney
islands
in
all
these
countries
like
unto
the
morning
stars
shine
ye
forth
from
the
horizon
of
guidance
thus
far
ye
have
been
untiring
in
your
labors
let
your
exertions
henceforth
increase
a
thousandfold
summon
the
people
in
these
countries
capitals
islands
assemblies
and
churches
to
enter
the
abha
kingdom
the
scope
of
your
exertions
must
needs
be
extended
the
wider
its
range
the
more
striking
will
be
the
evidence
of
divine
assistance
you
have
observed
that
while
abdulbaha
was
in
the
utmost
bodily
weakness
and
feebleness
while
he
was
indisposed
and
had
not
the
power
to
movenotwithstanding
this
physical
state
he
traveled
through
many
countries
in
europe
and
america
and
in
churches
meetings
and
conventions
was
occupied
with
the
promotion
of
the
divine
principles
and
summoned
the
people
to
the
manifestation
of
the
kingdom
of
abha
you
have
also
observed
how
the
confirmations
of
the
blessed
perfection
encompassed
all
what
result
is
forthcoming
from
material
rest
tranquillity
luxury
and
attachment
to
this
corporeal
world
it
is
evident
that
the
man
who
pursues
these
things
will
in
the
end
become
afflicted
with
regret
and
loss
consequently
one
must
close
his
eyes
wholly
to
these
thoughts
long
for
eternal
life
the
sublimity
of
the
world
of
humanity
the
celestial
developments
the
holy
spirit
the
promotion
of
the
word
of
god
the
guidance
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
globe
the
promulgation
of
universal
peace
and
the
proclamation
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
this
is
the
work
otherwise
like
unto
other
animals
and
birds
one
must
occupy
himself
with
the
requirements
of
this
physical
life
the
satisfaction
of
which
is
the
highest
aspiration
of
the
animal
kingdom
and
one
must
stalk
across
the
earth
like
unto
the
quadrupeds
consider
ye
no
matter
how
much
man
gains
wealth
riches
and
opulence
in
this
world
he
will
not
become
as
independent
as
a
cow
for
these
fattened
cows
roam
freely
over
the
vast
tableland
all
the
prairies
and
meadows
are
theirs
for
grazing
and
all
the
springs
and
rivers
are
theirs
for
drinking
no
matter
how
much
they
graze
the
fields
will
not
be
exhausted
it
is
evident
that
they
have
earned
these
material
bounties
with
the
utmost
facility
still
more
ideal
than
this
life
is
the
life
of
the
bird
a
bird
on
the
summit
of
a
mountain
on
the
high
waving
branches
has
built
for
itself
a
nest
more
beautiful
than
the
palaces
of
the
kings
the
air
is
in
the
utmost
purity
the
water
cool
and
clear
as
crystal
the
panorama
charming
and
enchanting
in
such
glorious
surroundings
he
expends
his
numbered
days
all
the
harvests
of
the
plain
are
his
possessions
having
earned
all
this
wealth
without
the
least
labor
hence
no
matter
how
much
man
may
advance
in
this
world
he
shall
not
attain
to
the
station
of
this
bird
thus
it
becomes
evident
that
in
the
matters
of
this
world
however
much
man
may
strive
and
work
to
the
point
of
death
he
will
be
unable
to
earn
the
abundance
the
freedom
and
the
independent
life
of
a
small
bird
this
proves
and
establishes
the
fact
that
man
is
not
created
for
the
life
of
this
ephemeral
worldnay
rather
is
he
created
for
the
acquirement
of
infinite
perfections
for
the
attainment
to
the
sublimity
of
the
world
of
humanity
to
be
drawn
nigh
unto
the
divine
threshold
and
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
everlasting
sovereignty
upon
you
be
bahaulabha
whoever
sets
out
on
a
teaching
journey
to
any
place
let
him
recite
this
prayer
day
and
night
during
his
travels
in
foreign
lands
o
god
my
god
thou
seest
me
enraptured
and

and

a

of
thine
omnipotent

supplicating
thee
in
the

and
invoking
thee
at

at

to
graciously

of
the
house

he
is
god
o
ye
apostles
of
bahaullah
may
my
life
be
sacrificed
for
you
the
blessed
person
of
the
promised
one
is
interpreted
in
the
holy
book
as
the
lord
of
hoststhe
heavenly
armies
by
heavenly
armies
those
souls
are
intended
who
are
entirely
freed
from
the
human
world
transformed
into
celestial
spirits
and
have
become
divine
angels
such
souls
are
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
who
will
illumine
all
the
continents
each
one
is
holding
in
his
hand
a
trumpet
blowing
the
breath
of
life
over
all
the
regions
they
are
delivered
from
human
qualities
and
the
defects
of
the
world
of
nature
are
characterized
with
the
characteristics
of
god
and
are
attracted
with
the
fragrances
of
the
merciful
like
unto
the
apostles
of
christ
who
were
filled
with
him
these
souls
also
have
become
filled
with
his
holiness
bahaullah
that
is
the
love
of
bahaullah
has
so
mastered
every
organ
part
and
limb
of
their
bodies
as
to
leave
no
effect
from
the
promptings
of
the
human
world
these
souls
are
the
armies
of
god
and
the
conquerors
of
the
east
and
the
west
should
one
of
them
turn
his
face
toward
some
direction
and
summon
the
people
to
the
kingdom
of
god
all
the
ideal
forces
and
lordly
confirmations
will
rush
to
his
support
and
reinforcement
he
will
behold
all
the
doors
open
and
all
the
strong
fortifications
and
impregnable
castles
razed
to
the
ground
singly
and
alone
he
will
attack
the
armies
of
the
world
defeat
the
right
and
left
wings
of
the
hosts
of
all
the
countries
break
through
the
lines
of
the
legions
of
all
the
nations
and
carry
his
attack
to
the
very
center
of
the
powers
of
the
earth
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
hosts
of
god
any
soul
from
among
the
believers
of
bahaullah
who
attains
to
this
station
will
become
known
as
the
apostle
of
bahaullah
therefore
strive
ye
with
heart
and
soul
so
that
ye
may
reach
this
lofty
and
exalted
position
be
established
on
the
throne
of
everlasting
glory
and
crown
your
heads
with
the
shining
diadem
of
the
kingdom
whose
brilliant
jewels
may
irradiate
upon
centuries
and
cycles
o
ye
kind
friends
uplift
your
magnanimity
and
soar
high
toward
the
apex
of
heaven
so
that
your
blessed
hearts
may
become
illumined
more
and
more
day
by
day
through
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
that
is
his
holiness
bahaullah
at
every
moment
the
spirits
may
obtain
a
new
life
and
the
darkness
of
the
world
of
nature
may
be
entirely
dispelled
thus
you
may
become
incarnate
light
and
personified
spirit
become
entirely
unaware
of
the
sordid
matters
of
this
world
and
in
touch
with
the
affairs
of
the
divine
world
behold
the
portals
which
bahaullah
hath
opened
before
you
consider
how
exalted
and
lofty
is
the
station
you
are
destined
to
attain
how
unique
the
favors
with
which
you
have
been
endowed
should
we
become
intoxicated
with
this
cup
the
sovereignty
of
this
globe
of
earth
will
become
lower
in
our
estimation
than
childrens
play
should
they
place
in
the
arena
the
crown
of
the
government
of
the
whole
world
and
invite
each
one
of
us
to
accept
it
undoubtedly
we
shall
not
condescend
and
shall
refuse
to
accept
it
to
attain
to
this
supreme
station
is
however
dependent
on
the
realization
of
certain
conditions
the
first
condition
is
firmness
in
the
covenant
of
god
for
the
power
of
the
covenant
will
protect
the
cause
of
bahaullah
from
the
doubts
of
the
people
of
error
it
is
the
fortified
fortress
of
the
cause
of
god
and
the
firm
pillar
of
the
religion
of
god
today
no
power
can
conserve
the
oneness
of
the
bahai
world
save
the
covenant
of
god
otherwise
differences
like
unto
a
most
great
tempest
will
encompass
the
bahai
world
it
is
evident
that
the
axis
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
is
the
power
of
the
covenant
and
nothing
else
had
the
covenant
not
come
to
pass
had
it
not
been
revealed
from
the
supreme
pen
and
had
not
the
book
of
the
covenant
like
unto
the
ray
of
the
sun
of
reality
illuminated
the
world
the
forces
of
the
cause
of
god
would
have
been
utterly
scattered
and
certain
souls
who
were
the
prisoners
of
their
own
passions
and
lusts
would
have
taken
into
their
hands
an
axe
cutting
the
root
of
this
blessed
tree
every
person
would
have
pushed
forward
his
own
desire
and
every
individual
aired
his
own
opinion
notwithstanding
this
great
covenant
a
few
negligent
souls
galloped
with
their
chargers
into
the
battlefield
thinking
perchance
they
might
be
able
to
weaken
the
foundation
of
the
cause
of
god
but
praise
be
to
god
all
of
them
were
afflicted
with
regret
and
loss
and
erelong
they
shall
see
themselves
in
poignant
despair
therefore
in
the
beginning
the
believers
must
make
their
steps
firm
in
the
covenant
so
that
the
confirmations
of
bahaullah
may
encircle
them
from
all
sides
the
cohorts
of
the
supreme
concourse
may
become
their
supporters
and
helpers
and
the
exhortations
and
advices
of
abdulbaha
like
unto
the
pictures
engraved
on
stone
may
remain
permanent
and
ineffaceable
in
the
tablets
of
all
hearts
the
second
condition
fellowship
and
love
amongst
the
believers
the
divine
friends
must
be
attracted
to
and
enamored
of
each
other
and
ever
be
ready
and
willing
to
sacrifice
their
own
lives
for
each
other
should
one
soul
from
amongst
the
believers
meet
another
it
must
be
as
though
a
thirsty
one
with
parched
lips
has
reached
to
the
fountain
of
the
water
of
life
or
a
lover
has
met
his
true
beloved
for
one
of
the
greatest
divine
wisdoms
regarding
the
appearance
of
the
holy
manifestations
is
this
the
souls
may
come
to
know
each
other
and
become
intimate
with
each
other
the
power
of
the
love
of
god
may
make
all
of
them
the
waves
of
one
sea
the
flowers
of
one
rose
garden
and
the
stars
of
one
heaven
this
is
the
wisdom
for
the
appearance
of
the
holy
manifestations
when
the
most
great
bestowal
reveals
itself
in
the
hearts
of
the
believers
the
world
of
nature
will
be
transformed
the
darkness
of
the
contingent
being
will
vanish
and
heavenly
illumination
will
be
obtained
then
the
whole
world
will
become
the
paradise
of
abha
every
one
of
the
believers
of
god
will
become
a
blessed
tree
producing
wonderful
fruits
o
ye
friends
fellowship
fellowship
love
love
unity
unityso
that
the
power
of
the
bahai
cause
may
appear
and
become
manifest
in
the
world
of
existence
my
thoughts
are
turned
towards
you
and
my
heart
leaps
within
me
at
your
mention
could
ye
know
how
my
soul
glows
with
your
love
so
great
a
happiness
would
flood
your
hearts
as
to
cause
you
to
become
enamored
with
each
other
the
third
condition
teachers
must
continually
travel
to
all
parts
of
the
continent
nay
rather
to
all
parts
of
the
world
but
they
must
travel
like
abdulbaha
who
journeyed
throughout
the
cities
of
america
he
was
sanctified
and
free
from
every
attachment
and
in
the
utmost
severance
just
as
his
holiness
christ
says
shake
off
the
very
dust
from
your
feet
you
have
observed
that
while
in
america
many
souls
in
the
utmost
of
supplication
and
entreaty
desired
to
offer
some
gifts
but
this
servant
in
accord
with
the
exhortations
and
behests
of
the
blessed
perfection
never
accepted
a
thing
although
on
certain
occasions
we
were
in
most
straitened
circumstances
but
on
the
other
hand
if
a
soul
for
the
sake
of
god
voluntarily
and
out
of
his
pure
desire
wishes
to
offer
a
contribution
toward
the
expenses
of
a
teacher
in
order
to
make
the
contributor
happy
the
teacher
may
accept
a
small
sum
but
must
live
with
the
utmost
contentment
the
aim
is
this
the
intention
of
the
teacher
must
be
pure
his
heart
independent
his
spirit
attracted
his
thought
at
peace
his
resolution
firm
his
magnanimity
exalted
and
in
the
love
of
god
a
shining
torch
should
he
become
as
such
his
sanctified
breath
will
even
affect
the
rock
otherwise
there
will
be
no
result
whatsoever
as
long
as
a
soul
is
not
perfected
how
can
he
efface
the
defects
of
others
unless
he
is
detached
from
aught
else
save
god
how
can
he
teach
severance
to
others
in
short
o
ye
believers
of
god
endeavor
ye
so
that
you
may
take
hold
of
every
means
in
the
promulgation
of
the
religion
of
god
and
the
diffusion
of
the
fragrances
of
god
amongst
other
things
is
the
holding
of
the
meetings
for
teaching
so
that
blessed
souls
and
the
old
ones
from
amongst
the
believers
may
gather
together
the
youths
of
the
love
of
god
in
schools
of
instruction
and
teach
them
all
the
divine
proofs
and
irrefragable
arguments
explain
and
elucidate
the
history
of
the
cause
and
interpret
also
the
prophecies
and
proofs
which
are
recorded
and
are
extant
in
the
divine
books
and
epistles
regarding
the
manifestation
of
the
promised
one
so
that
the
young
ones
may
go
in
perfect
knowledge
in
all
these
degrees
likewise
whenever
it
is
possible
a
committee
must
be
organized
for
the
translation
of
the
tablets
wise
souls
who
have
mastered
and
studied
perfectly
the
persian
arabic
and
other
foreign
languages
or
know
one
of
the
foreign
languages
must
commence
translating
tablets
and
books
containing
the
proofs
of
this
revelation
and
publishing
those
books
circulate
them
throughout
the
five
continents
of
the
globe
similarly
the
magazine
the
star
of
the
west
must
be
edited
with
the
utmost
regularity
but
its
contents
must
be
the
promulgation
of
the
cause
of
god
that
both
east
and
west
may
become
informed
of
the
most
important
events
in
short
in
all
the
meetings
whether
public
or
private
nothing
should
be
discussed
save
that
which
is
under
consideration
and
all
the
articles
be
centered
around
the
cause
of
god
promiscuous
talk
must
not
be
dragged
in
and
contention
is
absolutely
forbidden
the
teachers
traveling
in
different
directions
must
know
the
language
of
the
country
in
which
they
will
enter
for
example
a
person
being
proficient
in
the
japanese
language
may
travel
to
japan
or
a
person
knowing
the
chinese
language
may
hasten
to
china
and
so
forth
in
short
after
this
universal
war
the
people
have
obtained
extraordinary
capacity
to
hearken
to
the
divine
teachings
for
the
wisdom
of
this
war
is
this
that
it
may
become
proven
to
all
that
the
fire
of
war
is
worldconsuming
whereas
the
rays
of
peace
are
worldenlightening
one
is
death
the
other
is
life
this
is
extinction
that
is
immortality
one
is
the
most
great
calamity
the
other
is
the
most
great
bounty
this
is
darkness
that
is
light
this
is
eternal
humiliation
and
that
is
everlasting
glory
one
is
the
destroyer
of
the
foundation
of
man
the
other
is
the
founder
of
the
prosperity
of
the
human
race
consequently
a
number
of
souls
may
arise
and
act
in
accordance
with
the
aforesaid
conditions
and
hasten
to
all
parts
of
the
world
especially
from
america
to
europe
africa
asia
and
australia
and
travel
through
japan
and
china
likewise
from
germany
teachers
and
believers
may
travel
to
the
continents
of
america
africa
japan
and
china
in
brief
they
may
travel
through
all
the
continents
and
islands
of
the
globe
thus
in
a
short
space
of
time
most
wonderful
results
will
be
produced
the
banner
of
universal
peace
will
be
waving
on
the
apex
of
the
world
and
the
lights
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
may
illumine
the
universe
in
brief
o
ye
believers
of
god
the
text
of
the
divine
book
is
this
if
two
souls
quarrel
and
contend
about
a
question
of
the
divine
questions
differing
and
disputing
both
are
wrong
the
wisdom
of
this
incontrovertible
law
of
god
is
this
that
between
two
souls
from
amongst
the
believers
of
god
no
contention
and
dispute
may
arise
that
they
may
speak
with
each
other
with
infinite
amity
and
love
should
there
appear
the
least
trace
of
controversy
they
must
remain
silent
and
both
parties
must
continue
their
discussions
no
longer
but
ask
the
reality
of
the
question
from
the
interpreter
this
is
the
irrefutable
command
upon
you
be
bahaulabha
supplication
o
god
my
god
thou
seest
how
black
darkness
is
enshrouding
all
regions
how
all
countries
are
burning
with
the
flame
of
dissension
and
the
fire
of
war
and
carnage
is
blazing
throughout
the
east
and
the
west
blood
is
flowing
corpses
bestrew
the
ground
and
severed
heads
are
fallen
on
the
dust
of
the
battlefield
o
lord
have
pity
on
these
ignorant
ones
and
look
upon
them
with
the
eye
of
forgiveness
and
pardon
extinguish
this
fire
so
that
these
dense
clouds
which
obscure
the
horizon
may
be
scattered
the
sun
of
reality
shine
forth
with
the
rays
of
conciliation
this
intense
gloom
be
dispelled
and
the
resplendent
light
of
peace
shed
its
radiance
upon
all
countries
o
lord
draw
up
the
people
from
the
abyss
of
the
ocean
of
hatred
and
enmity
and
deliver
them
from
this
impenetrable
darkness
unite
their
hearts
and
brighten
their
eyes
with
the
light
of
peace
and
reconciliation
deliver
them
from
the
depths
of
war
and
bloodshed
and
free
them
from
the
darkness
of
error
remove
the
veil
from
their
eyes
and
enlighten
their
hearts
with
the
light
of
guidance
treat
them
with
thy
tender
mercy
and
compassion
and
deal
not
with
them
according
to
thy
justice
and
wrath
which
cause
the
limbs
of
the
mighty
to
quake
o
lord
wars
have
persisted
distress
and
anxiety
have
waxed
great
and
every
flourishing
region
is
laid
waste
o
lord
hearts
are
heavy
and
souls
are
in
anguish
have
mercy
on
these
poor
souls
and
do
not
leave
them
to
the
excesses
of
their
own
desires
o
lord
make
manifest
in
thy
lands
humble
and
submissive
souls
their
faces
illumined
with
the
rays
of
guidance
severed
from
the
world
extolling
thy
name
uttering
thy
praise
and
diffusing
the
fragrance
of
thy
holiness
amongst
mankind
o
lord
strengthen
their
backs
gird
up
their
loins
and
enrapture
their
hearts
with
the
most
mighty
signs
of
thy
love
o
lord
verily
they
are
weak
and
thou
art
the
powerful
and
the
mighty
they
are
impotent
and
thou
art
the
helper
and
the
merciful
o
lord
the
ocean
of
rebellion
is
surging
and
these
tempests
will
not
be
stilled
save
through
thy
boundless
grace
which
hath
embraced
all
regions
o
lord
verily
the
people
are
in
the
abyss
of
passion
and
naught
can
save
them
but
thine
infinite
bounties
o
lord
dispel
the
darkness
of
these
corrupt
desires
and
illumine
the
hearts
with
the
lamp
of
thy

thy

those
who
leaving

have
for
the
love
of
thy

foreign

to
diffuse

be
thou
their

and

he
is
god
o
ye
real
friends
all
countries
in
the
estimation
of
the
one
true
god
are
but
one
country
and
all
cities
and
villages
are
on
an
equal
footing
neither
holds
distinction
over
another
all
of
them
are
the
fields
of
god
and
the
habitation
of
the
souls
of
men
through
faith
and
certitude
and
the
precedence
achieved
by
one
over
another
however
the
dweller
conferreth
honor
upon
the
dwelling
some
of
the
countries
achieve
distinction
and
attain
a
preeminent
position
for
instance
notwithstanding
that
some
of
the
countries
of
europe
and
of
america
are
distinguished
by
and
surpass
other
countries
in
the
salubrity
of
their
climate
the
wholesomeness
of
their
water
and
the
charm
of
their
mountains
plains
and
prairies
yet
palestine
became
the
glory
of
all
nations
inasmuch
as
all
the
holy
and
divine
manifestations
from
the
time
of
abraham
until
the
appearance
of
the
seal
of
the
prophets
muhammad
have
lived
in
or
migrated
to
or
traveled
through
that
country
likewise
mecca
and
medina
have
achieved
illimitable
glory
as
the
light
of
prophethood
shone
forth
therein
for
this
reason
palestine
and
hijaz
have
been
distinguished
from
all
other
countries
likewise
the
continent
of
america
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
one
true
god
the
land
wherein
the
splendors
of
his
light
shall
be
revealed
where
the
mysteries
of
his
faith
shall
be
unveiled
where
the
righteous
will
abide
and
the
free
assemble
therefore
every
section
thereof
is
blessed
but
because
these
nine
states
have
been
favored
in
faith
and
assurance
hence
through
this
precedence
they
have
obtained
spiritual
privilege
they
must
realize
the
value
of
this
bounty
because
they
have
obtained
such
a
favor
and
in
order
to
render
thanksgiving
for
this
most
great
bestowal
they
must
arise
in
the
diffusion
of
divine
fragrances
so
that
the
blessed
verse
of
the
quran
god
is
the
light
of
heaven
and
earth
the
similitude
of
his
light
is
a
niche
in
a
wall
wherein
a
lamp
is
placed
and
the
lamp
enclosed
in
a
case
of
glass
the
glass
appears
as
if
it
were
a
shining
star
it
is
lighted
with
the
oil
of
a
blessed
tree
an
olive
neither
of
the
east
nor
of
the
west
it
wanteth
little
but
that
the
oil
thereof
would
give
light
although
no
fire
touched
it
this
is
the
light
added
unto
light
god
will
direct
unto
his
light
whom
he
pleasethmay
be
realized
he
says
the
world
of
nature
is
the
world
of
darkness
because
it
is
the
origin
of
a
thousand
depravities
nay
rather
it
is
darkness
upon
darkness
the
illumination
of
the
world
of
nature
is
dependent
upon
the
splendor
of
the
sun
of
reality
the
grace
of
guidance
is
like
unto
the
candle
which
is
enkindled
in
the
glass
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
and
that
glass
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
is
the
mirror
of
the
heart
of
humanity
the
oil
of
that
luminous
lamp
is
from
the
fruits
of
the
blessed
tree
and
that
oil
is
so
refined
that
it
will
burn
without
light
when
the
intensity
of
the
light
and
the
translucency
of
the
glass
and
the
purity
of
the
mirror
are
brought
together
it
will
become
light
upon
light
in
brief
in
these
nine
blessed
states
abdulbaha
journeyed
and
traveled
from
place
to
place
explained
the
wisdom
of
the
heavenly
books
and
diffused
the
fragrances
in
most
of
these
states
he
founded
the
divine
edifice
and
opened
the
door
of
teaching
in
those
states
he
sowed
pure
seeds
and
planted
blessed
trees
now
the
believers
of
god
and
the
maidservants
of
the
merciful
must
irrigate
these
fields
and
with
the
utmost
power
engage
themselves
in
the
cultivation
of
these
heavenly
plantations
so
that
the
seeds
may
grow
and
develop
prosperity
and
blessing
be
realized
and
many
rich
and
great
harvests
be
gathered
in
the
kingdom
of
god
is
like
unto
a
farmer
who
comes
into
possession
of
a
piece
of
pure
and
virgin
soil
heavenly
seeds
are
scattered
therein
the
clouds
of
divine
providence
pour
down
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
of
reality
shine
forth
now
all
these
bounties
exist
and
appear
in
full
in
these
nine
states
the
divine
gardener
passed
by
that
holy
ground
and
scattered
pure
seeds
from
the
lordly
teachings
in
that
field
the
rain
of
the
bounties
of
god
poured
down
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
of
realitythat
is
the
merciful
confirmationsshone
with
the
utmost
splendor
it
is
my
hope
that
each
one
of
those
blessed
souls
may
become
a
peerless
and
unique
irrigator
and
the
east
and
the
west
of
america
may
become
like
unto
a
delectable
paradise
so
that
all
of
you
may
hear
from
the
supreme
concourse
the
cry
of
blessed
are
you
and
again
blessed
are
you
upon
you
be
greeting
and

the
following
supplication
is
to
be
read
by
the
teachers
and

daily
o
thou
kind
lord
praise
be
unto
thee
that
thou
hast
shown
us
the
highway
of
guidance
opened
the
doors
of
the
kingdom
and
manifested
thyself
through
the
sun
of
reality
to
the
blind
thou
hast
given
sight
to
the
deaf
thou
hast
granted
hearing
thou
hast
resuscitated
the
dead
thou
hast
enriched
the
poor
thou
hast
shown
the
way
to
those
who
have
gone
astray
thou
hast
led
those
with
parched
lips
to
the
fountain
of
guidance
thou
hast
suffered
the
thirsty
fish
to
reach
the
ocean
of
reality
and
thou
hast
invited
the
wandering
birds
to
the
rose
garden
of
grace
o
thou
almighty
we
are
thy
servants
and
thy
poor
ones
we
are
remote
and
yearn
for
thy
presence
are
athirst
for
the
water
of
thy
fountain
are
ill
longing
for
thy
healing
we
are
walking
in
thy
path
and
have
no
aim
or
hope
save
the
diffusion
of
thy
fragrance
so
that
all
souls
may
raise
the
cry
o
god
guide
us
to
the
straight
path
may
their
eyes
be
opened
to
behold
the
light
and
may
they
be
freed
from
the
darkness
of
ignorance
may
they
gather
around
the
lamp
of
thy
guidance
may
every
portionless
one
receive
a
share
may
the
deprived
become
the
confidants
of
thy
mysteries
o
almighty
look
upon
us
with
the
glance
of
mercifulness
grant
us
heavenly
confirmation
bestow
upon
us
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
so
that
we
may
be
assisted
in
thy
service
and
like
unto
brilliant
stars
shine
in
these
regions
with
the
light
of
thy
guidance
verily
thou
art
the
powerful
the
mighty
the
wise
and
the
seeing
tablet
to
the
bahais
of
the
southern
states
revealed
on

in

o
ye
blessed
respected
souls
the
philosophers
of
the
ancients
the
thinkers
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
scientists
of
this
and
the
former
centuries
have
all
agreed
upon
the
fact
that
the
best
and
the
most
ideal
region
for
the
habitation
of
man
is
the
temperate
zone
for
in
this
belt
the
intellects
and
thoughts
rise
to
the
highest
stage
of
maturity
and
the
capability
and
ability
of
civilization
manifest
themselves
in
full
efflorescence
when
you
read
history
critically
and
with
a
penetrating
eye
it
becomes
evident
that
the
majority
of
the
famous
men
have
been
born
reared
and
have
done
their
work
in
the
temperate
zone
while
very
very
few
have
appeared
from
the
torrid
and
frigid
zones
now
these
sixteen
southern
states
of
the
united
states
are
situated
in
the
temperate
zone
and
in
these
regions
the
perfections
of
the
world
of
nature
have
been
fully
revealed
for
the
moderation
of
the
weather
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
and
the
geographical
configuration
of
the
country
display
a
great
effect
in
the
world
of
minds
and
thoughts
this
fact
is
well
demonstrated
through
observation
and
experience
even
the
holy
divine
manifestations
have
had
a
nature
in
the
utmost
equilibrium
the
health
and
wholesomeness
of
their
bodies
most
perfect
their
constitutions
endowed
with
physical
vigor
their
powers
functioning
in
perfect
order
and
the
outward
sensations
linked
with
the
inward
perceptions
working
together
with
extraordinary
momentum
and
coordination
therefore
in
these
sixteen
states
because
they
are
contiguous
to
other
states
and
their
climate
being
in
the
utmost
of
moderation
unquestionably
the
divine
teachings
must
reveal
themselves
with
a
brighter
effulgence
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
must
display
a
penetrating
intensity
the
ocean
of
the
love
of
god
must
be
stirred
with
higher
waves
the
breezes
of
the
rose
garden
of
the
divine
love
be
wafted
with
higher
velocity
and
the
fragrances
of
holiness
be
diffused
with
swiftness
and
rapidity
praise
be
to
god
that
the
divine
outpourings
are
infinite
the
melody
of
the
lordly
principles
is
in
the
utmost
efficacy
the
most
great
orb
shining
with
perfect
splendor
the
cohorts
of
the
supreme
concourse
are
attacking
with
invincible
power
the
tongues
are
sharper
than
the
swords
the
hearts
are
more
brilliant
than
the
light
of
electricity
the
magnanimity
of
the
friends
precedes
all
the
magnanimities
of
the
former
and
subsequent
generations
the
souls
are
divinely
attracted
and
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
is
enkindled
at
this
time
and
at
this
period
we
must
avail
ourselves
of
this
most
great
opportunity
we
must
not
sit
inactive
for
one
moment
we
must
sever
ourselves
from
composure
rest
tranquillity
goods
property
life
and
attachment
to
material
things
we
must
sacrifice
everything
to
his
highness
the
possessor
of
existence
so
that
the
powers
of
the
kingdom
may
show
greater
penetration
and
the
brilliant
effulgence
in
this
new
cycle
may
illumine
the
worlds
of
minds
and
ideals
it
is
about
twentythree
years
that
the
fragrances
of
god
have
been
diffused
in
america
but
no
adequate
and
befitting
motion
has
been
realized
and
no
great
acclamation
and
acceleration
has
been
witnessed
now
it
is
my
hope
that
through
the
heavenly
power
the
fragrances
of
the
merciful
the
attraction
of
consciousness
the
celestial
outpourings
the
heavenly
cohorts
and
the
gushing
forth
of
the
fountain
of
divine
love
the
believers
of
god
may
arise
and
in
a
short
time
the
greatest
good
may
unveil
her
countenance
the
sun
of
reality
may
shine
forth
with
such
intensity
that
the
darkness
of
the
world
of
nature
may
become
entirely
dispelled
and
driven
away
from
every
corner
a
most
wonderful
melody
may
be
raised
the
morning
birds
may
break
into
such
a
song
that
the
world
of
humanity
may
be
quickened
and
moved
the
solid
bodies
may
become
liquefied
and
the
souls
who
are
like
unto
adamantine
rocks
may
open
their
wings
and
through
the
heat
of
the
love
of
god
fly
heavenward
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
armenia
was
enveloped
with
impenetrable
darkness
one
blessed
soul
from
among
the
disciples
of
christ
hastened
to
that
part
and
through
his
effort
erelong
that
province
became
illumined
thus
it
has
become
evident
how
the
power
of
the
kingdom
works
therefore
rest
ye
assured
in
the
confirmations
of
the
merciful
and
the
assistance
of
the
most
high
become

sanctified

and
purified
from

your
intentions
to
work
for
the
good
of
all
cut
your
attachment
to
the
earth
and
like
unto
the
essence
of
the
spirit
become
ye
light
and
delicate
then
with
a
firm
resolution
a
pure
heart
a
rejoiced
spirit
and
an
eloquent

engage
your
time
in
the
promulgation
of
the
divine
principles
so
that
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
may
pitch
her
canopy
in
the
apex
of
america
and
all
the
nations
of
the
world
may
follow
the
divine
policy
this
is
certain
that
the
divine
policy
is
justice
and
kindness
toward
all
mankind
for
all
the
nations
of
the
world

the
sheep
of

he
has
created
these
sheep
he
has
protected
them

and
trained
them

greater
kindness
than

every
moment

hundred
thousand
thanksgivings

be
attracted
to

tabernacle
of

be
pitched
on

apex
of

song
of
the
love
of

may
exhilarate
and
rejoice
all
the
nations
and

the
surface
of
the
earth
may
become
the
eternal

unspeakably
glorious

evolve
into
a
center
from
which
waves
of
spiritual
power
will
emanate
and
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
of
god
will
in
the
plentitude
of
its
majesty
and
glory
be
firmly
established
this
phenomenal
world
will
not
remain
in
an
unchanging
condition
even
for
a
short
while
second
after
second
it
undergoes
change
and
transformation
every
foundation
will
finally
become
collapsed
every
glory
and
splendor
will
at
last
vanish
and
disappear
but
the
kingdom
of
god
is
eternal
and
the
heavenly
sovereignty
and
majesty
will
stand
firm
everlasting
hence
in
the
estimation
of
a
wise
man
the
mat
in
the
kingdom
of
god
is
preferable
to
the
throne
of
the
government
of
the
world
continually
my
ear
and
eye
are
turned
toward
the
central
states
perchance
a
melody
from
some
blessed
souls
may
reach
my
earssouls
who
are
the
dawningplaces
of
the
love
of
god
the
stars
of
the
horizon
of
sanctification
and
holinesssouls
who
will
illumine
this
dark
universe
and
quicken
to
life
this
dead
world
the
joy
of
abdulbaha
depends
upon
this
i
hope
that
you
may
become
confirmed
therein
consequently
those
souls
who
are
in
a
condition
of
the
utmost
severance
purified
from
the
defects
of
the
world
of
nature
sanctified
from
attachment
to
this
earth
vivified
with
the
breaths
of
eternal
lifewith
luminous
hearts
with
heavenly
spirit
with
attraction
of
consciousness
with
celestial
magnanimity
with
eloquent
tongues
and
with
clear
explanationssuch
souls
must
hasten
and
travel
through
all
parts
of
the
central
states
in
every
city
and
village
they
must
occupy
themselves
with
the
diffusion
of
the
divine
exhortations
and
advices
guide
the
souls
and
promote
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
they
must
play
the
melody
of
international
conciliation
with
such
power
that
every
deaf

may
attain
hearing
every
extinct
person
may
be
set
aglow
every

may
obtain

may
find
ecstasy
it
is
certain
that
such
will
be
the
consummation
let
the
spreaders
of
the

of
god
recite
this
prayer
every
morning
o

my

to
the

he

o
ye

and
the
maidservants
of
the
merciful
the
chosen
ones
of
the
kingdom
the
blessed
state
of
california
bears
the
utmost
similarity
to
the
holy
land
that
is
the
country
of
palestine
the
air
is
of
the
utmost
temperance
the
plain
very
spacious
and
the
fruits
of
palestine
are
seen
in
that
state
in
the
utmost
of
freshness
and
delicacy
when
abdulbaha
was
traveling
and
journeying
through
those
states
he
found
himself
in
palestine
for
from
every
standpoint
there
was
a
perfect
likeness
between
this
region
and
that
state
even
the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean
in
some
instances
show
perfect
resemblance
to
the
shores
of
the
holy
landeven
the
flora
of
the
holy
land
have
grown
on
those
shoresthe
study
of
which
had
led
to
much
speculation
and
wonder
likewise
in
the
state
of
california
and
other
western
states
wonderful
scenes
of
the
world
of
nature
which
bewilder
the
minds
of
men
are
manifest
lofty
mountains
deep
canyons
great
and
majestic
waterfalls
and
giant
trees
are
witnessed
on
all
sides
while
its
soil
is
in
the
utmost
fertility
and
richness
that
blessed
state
is
similar
to
the
holy
land
and
that
region
and
that
country
like
unto
a
delectable
paradise
is
in
many
ways
identical
with
palestine
now
just
as
there
are
natural
resemblances
heavenly
resemblances
must
also
be
acquired
the
lights
of
the
divine
traces
are
manifest
in
palestine
the
majority
of
the
israelitish
prophets
raised
the
call
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
this
holy
ground
having
spread
the
spiritual
teachings
the
nostrils
of
the
spirituallyminded
ones
became
fragrant
the
eyes
of
the
illumined
souls
became
brightened
the
ears
were
thrilled
through
this
song
the
hearts
obtained
eternal
life
from
the
soulrefreshing
breeze
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
gained
supreme
illumination
from
the
splendor
of
the
sun
of
reality
then
from
this
region
the
light
was
spread
to
europe
america
asia
africa
and
australia
now
california
and
the
other
western
states
must
earn
an
ideal
similarity
with
the
holy
land
and
from
that
state
and
that
region
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
be
diffused
to
all
parts
of
america
and
europe
that
the
call
of
the
kingdom
of
god
may
exhilarate
and
rejoice
all
the
ears
the
divine
principles
bestow
a
new
life
the
different
parties
may
become
one
party
the
divergent
ideas
may
disappear
and
revolve
around
one
unique
center
the
east
and
the
west
of
america
may
embrace
each
other
the
anthem
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
may
confer
a
new
life
upon
all
the
children
of
men
and
the
tabernacle
of
universal
peace
be
pitched
on
the
apex
of
america
thus
europe
and
africa
may
become
vivified
with
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
this
world
may
become
another
world
the
body
politic
may
attain
to
a
new
exhilaration
and
just
as
in
the
state
of
california
and
other
western
states
the
marvelous
scenes
of
the
world
of
nature
are
evident
and
manifest
the
great
signs
of
the
kingdom
of
god
may
also
be
unveiled
so
that
the
body
may
correspond
with
the
spirit
the
outward
world
may
become
a
symbol
of
the
inward
world
and
the
mirror
of
the
earth
may
become
the
mirror
of
the
kingdom
reflecting
the
ideal
virtues
of
heaven
during
my
journey
and
traveling
in
those
parts
i
beheld
wonderful
scenes
and
beautiful
panoramas
of
nature
orchards
and
rivers
national
parks
and
general
conclaves
deserts
plains
meadows
and
prairies
and
the
grains
and
fruits
of
that
region
greatly
attracted
my
attention
even
to
the
present
moment
they
are
in
my
mind
particularly
was
i
greatly
pleased
with
the
meetings
in
san
francisco
and
oakland
the
gatherings
in
los
angeles
and
the
believers
who
came
from
the
cities
of
other
states
whenever
their
faces
cross
my
memory
immediately
infinite
happiness
is
realized
therefore
i
hope
that
the
divine
teachings
like
unto
the
rays
of
the
sun
may
be
diffused
in
all
the
western
states
and
the
blessed
verse
of
the
quran
it
is
a
good
city
and
the
lord
is
the
forgiver
may
become
realized
likewise
the
significance
of
another
quranic
verse
do
ye
not
travel
through
the
land
and
of
the
verse
behold
the
traces
of
the
mercy
of
god
become
revealed
in
the
utmost
effulgence
praise
be
to
god
that
through
the
divine
bounty
and
providence
in
that
region
the
field
of
service
is
vast
the
minds
are
in
the
utmost
degree
of
intelligence
and
progress
sciences
and
arts
are
being
promoted
the
hearts
like
unto
mirrors
are
in
the
utmost
state
of
purity
and
translucency
and
the
friends
of
god
are
in
perfect
attraction
therefore
it
is
hoped
that
meetings
for
teaching
will
be
organized
and
instituted
and
for
the
diffusion
of
the
fragrances
of
god
wise
teachers
may
be
sent
to
cities
even
to
villages
the
teachers
of
the
cause
must
be
heavenly
lordly
and
radiant
they
must
be
embodied
spirit
personified
intellect
and
arise
in
service
with
the
utmost
firmness
steadfastness
and
selfsacrifice
in
their
journeys
they
must
not
be
attached
to
food
and
clothing
they
must
concentrate
their
thoughts
on
the
outpourings
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
beg
for
the
confirmations
of
the
holy
spirit
with
a
divine
power
with
an
attraction
of
consciousness
with
heavenly
glad
tidings
and
celestial
holiness
they
must
perfume
the
nostrils
with
the
fragrances
of
the
paradise
of
abha
the
following

is
to
be

in

god
says
thou
shalt
see
no
difference
in

creatures
of

in
other
words
he
says
from
the
ideal
standpoint
there
is
no
variation
between
the
creatures
of
god
because
they
are
all
created
by
him
from
the
above
premise
a
conclusion
is
drawn
that
there
is
no
difference
between
countries
the
future
of
the
dominion
of
canada
however
is
very
great
and
the
events
connected
with
it
infinitely
glorious
it
shall
become
the
object
of
the
glance
of
providence
and
shall
show
forth
the
bounties
of
the
allglorious
abdulbaha
during
his
journey
and
sojourn
through
that
dominion
obtained
the
utmost
joy
before
my
departure
many
souls
warned
me
not
to
travel
to
montreal
saying
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
are
catholics
and
are
in
the
utmost
fanaticism
that
they
are
submerged
in
the
sea
of
imitations
that
they
have
not
the
capability
to
hearken
to
the
call
of
the
kingdom
of
god
that
the
veil
of
bigotry
has
so
covered
the
eyes
that
they
have
deprived
themselves
from
beholding
the
signs
of
the
most
great
guidance
and
that
the
dogmas
have
taken
possession
of
the
hearts
entirely
leaving
no
trace
of
reality
they
asserted
that
should
the
sun
of
reality
shine
with
perfect
splendor
throughout
that
dominion
the
dark
impenetrable
clouds
of
superstitions
have
so
enveloped
the
horizon
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
anyone
to
behold
its
rays
but
these
stories
did
not
have
any
effect
on
the
resolution
of
abdulbaha
he
trusting
in
god
turned
his
face
toward
montreal
when
he
entered
that
city
he
observed
all
the
doors
open
he
found
the
hearts
in
the
utmost
receptivity
and
the
ideal
power
of
the
kingdom
of
god
removing
every
obstacle
and
obstruction
in
the
churches
and
meetings
of
that
dominion
he
called
men
to
the
kingdom
of
god
with
the
utmost
joy
and
scattered
such
seeds
which
will
be
irrigated
with
the
hand
of
divine
power
undoubtedly
those
seeds
will
grow
becoming
green
and
verdant
and
many
rich
harvests
will
be
gathered
in
the
promotion
of
the
divine
principles
he
found
no
antagonist
and
no
adversary
the
believers
he
met
in
that
city
were
in
the
utmost
spirituality
and
attracted
with
the
fragrances
of
god
he
found
that
through
the
effort
of
the
maidservant
of
god
mrs
maxwell
a
number
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
kingdom
in
that
dominion
were
gathered
together
and
associated
with
each
other
increasing
this
joyous
exhilaration
day
by
day
the
time
of
sojourn
was
limited
to
a
number
of
days
but
the
results
in
the
future
are
inexhaustible
when
a
farmer
comes
into
the
possession
of
a
virgin
soil
in
a
short
time
he
will
bring
under
cultivation
a
large
field
therefore
i
hope
that
in
the
future
montreal
may
become
so
stirred
that
the
melody
of
the
kingdom
may
travel
to
all
parts
of
the
world
from
that
dominion
and
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
may
spread
from
that
center
to
the
east
and
the
west
of
america
o
ye
believers
of
god
be
not
concerned
with
the
smallness
of
your
numbers
neither
be
oppressed
by
the
multitude
of
an
unbelieving
world
five
grains
of
wheat
will
be
endued
with
heavenly
blessing
whereas
a
thousand
tons
of
tares
will
yield
no
results
or
effect
one
fruitful
tree
will
be
conducive
to
the
life
of
society
whereas
a
thousand
forests
of
wild
trees
offer
no
fruits
the
plain
is
covered
with
pebbles
but
precious
stones
are
rare
one
pearl
is
better
than
a
thousand
wildernesses
of
sand
especially
this
pearl
of
great
price
which
is
endowed
with
divine
blessing
erelong
thousands
of
other
pearls
will
be
born
from
it
when
that
pearl
associates
and
becomes
the
intimate
of
the
pebbles
they
also
all
change
into
pearls
again
i
repeat
that
the
future
of
canada
whether
from
a
material
or
a
spiritual
standpoint
is
very
great
day
by
day
civilization
and
freedom
shall
increase
the
clouds
of
the
kingdom
will
water
the
seeds
of
guidance
which
have
been
sown
there
consequently
rest
ye
not
seek
ye
no
composure
attach
not
yourselves
to
the
luxuries
of
this
ephemeral
world
free
yourselves
from
every
attachment
and
strive
with
heart
and
soul
to
become
fully
established
in
the
kingdom
of
god
gain
ye
the
heavenly
treasures
day
by
day
become
ye
more
illumined
draw
ye
nearer
and
nearer
unto
the
threshold
of
oneness
become
ye
the
manifestors
of
spiritual
favors
and
the
dawningplaces
of
infinite
lights
if
it
is
possible
send
ye
teachers
to
other
portions
of
canada
likewise
dispatch
ye
teachers
to
greenland
and
the
home
of
the
eskimos
as
regards
the
teachers
they
must
completely
divest
themselves
from
the
old
garments
and
be
invested
with
a
new
garment
according
to
the
statement
of
christ
they
must
attain
to
the
station
of
rebirththat
is
whereas
in
the
first
instance
they
were
born
from
the
womb
of
the
mother
this
time
they
must
be
born
from
the
womb
of
the
world
of
nature
just
as
they
are
now
totally
unaware
of
the
experiences
of
the
fetal
world
they
must
also
forget
entirely
the
defects
of
the
world
of
nature
they
must
be
baptized
with
the
water
of
life
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
and
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
be
satisfied
with
little
food
but
take
a
large
portion
from
the
heavenly
table
they
must
disengage
themselves
from
temptation
and
covetousness
and
be
filled
with
the
spirit
through
the
effect
of
their
pure
breath
they
must
change
the
stone
into
the
brilliant
ruby
and
the
shell
into
pearl
like
unto
the
cloud
of
vernal
shower
they
must
transform
the
black
soil
into
the
rose
garden
and
orchard
they
must
make
the
blind
seeing
the
deaf
hearing
the
extinguished
one
enkindled
and
set
aglow
and
the
dead
quickened
upon
you

praise
be
to
thee
o
my
god
these
are
thy
servants
who
are
attracted
by
the
fragrances
of
thy
mercifulness
are
enkindled
by
the
fire
burning
in
the
tree
of
thy
singleness
and
whose
eyes
are
brightened
by
beholding
the
splendors
of

thy
praise
through
thy

verily
thou
art
the
allpowerful
the
most
exalted
the
everforgiving
the
allmerciful
the
spreaders
of
the
fragrances
of
god
should
recite
this
prayer
every
morning
o
god
my
god
thou
beholdest
this
weak
one
begging
for
celestial
strength
this
poor
one
craving
thy
heavenly
treasures
this
thirsty
one
longing
for
the
fountain
of
eternal

this

yearning
for
thy

through
thy
boundless
mercy
which
thou
hast
destined
for
thy

in
thy

on

o

assist
me
with
thine

to
diffuse
thy
holy

and
to
spread
abroad
thy
teachings
amongst
the
choicest
of

o
my
lord
suffer

to
be

to
be
wholly
devoted
to
thy
faith
to
remain
fast
and
firm
in
thy
love
and
to
observe
what
thou
hast
prescribed
in
thy
book
verily
thou
art
the
powerful
the
mighty
the
omnipotent
tablet
to
the
bahais
of
the
united
states
and
canada
revealed
on
march
in
the
summerhouse
ismail
aqas
room
at
abdulbahas
house
in
haifa
and
addressed
to
the
bahais
of
the
united
states
and
canada
he
is
god
o
ye
heavenly
souls
sons
and
daughters
of
the
kingdom
god
says
in
the
quran
take
ye
hold
of
the
cord
of
god
all
of
you
and
become
ye
not
disunited
in
the
contingent
world
there
are
many
collective
centers
which
are
conducive
to
association
and
unity
between
the
children
of
men
for
example
patriotism
is
a
collective
center
nationalism
is
a
collective
center
identity
of
interests
is
a
collective
center
political
alliance
is
a
collective
center
the
union
of
ideals
is
a
collective
center
and
the
prosperity
of
the
world
of
humanity
is
dependent
upon
the
organization
and
promotion
of
the
collective
centers
nevertheless
all
the
above
institutions
are
in
reality
the
matter
and
not
the
substance
accidental
and
not
eternaltemporary
and
not
everlasting
with
the
appearance
of
great
revolutions
and
upheavals
all
these
collective
centers
are
swept
away
but
the
collective
center
of
the
kingdom
embodying
the
institutions
and
divine
teachings
is
the
eternal
collective
center
it
establishes
relationship
between
the
east
and
the
west
organizes
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
and
destroys
the
foundation
of
differences
it
overcomes
and
includes
all
the
other
collective
centers
like
unto
the
ray
of
the
sun
it
dispels
entirely
the
darkness
encompassing
all
the
regions
bestows
ideal
life
and
causes
the
effulgence
of
divine
illumination
through
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
it
performs
miracles
the
orient
and
the
occident
embrace
each
other
the
north
and
south
become
intimates
and
associates
conflicting
and
contending
opinions
disappear
antagonistic
aims
are
brushed
aside
the
law
of
the
struggle
for
existence
is
abrogated
and
the
canopy
of
the
oneness
of
the
world
of
humanity
is
raised
on
the
apex
of
the
globe
casting
its
shade
over
all
the
races
of
men
consequently
the
real
collective
center
is
the
body
of
the
divine
teachings
which
include
all
the
degrees
and
embrace
all
the
universal
relations
and
necessary
laws
of
humanity
consider
the
people
of
the
east
and
the
west
were
in
the
utmost
strangeness
now
to
what
a
high
degree
they
are
acquainted
with
each
other
and
united
together
how
far
are
the
inhabitants
of
persia
from
the
remotest
countries
of
america
and
now
observe
how
great
has
been
the
influence
of
the
heavenly
power
for
the
distance
of
thousands
of
miles
has
become
identical
with
one
step
how
various
nations
that
have
had
no
relations
or
similarity
with
each
other
are
now
united
and
agreed
through
this
divine
potency
indeed
to
god
belongs
power
in
the
past
and
in
the
future
and
verily
god
is
powerful
over
all
things
consider
the
flowers
of
a
garden
though
differing
in
kind
color
form
and
shape
yet
inasmuch
as
they
are
refreshed
by
the
waters
of
one
spring
revived
by
the
breath
of
one
wind
invigorated
by
the
rays
of
one
sun
this
diversity
increaseth
their
charm
and
addeth
unto
their
beauty
how
unpleasing
to
the
eye
if
all
the
flowers
and
plants
the
leaves
and
blossoms
the
fruits
the
branches
and
the
trees
of
that
garden
were
all
of
the
same
shape
and
color
diversity
of
hues
form
and
shape
enricheth
and
adorneth
the
garden
and
heighteneth
the
effect
thereof
in
like
manner
when
divers
shades
of
thought
temperament
and
character
are
brought
together
under
the
power
and
influence
of
one
central
agency
the
beauty
and
glory
of
human
perfection
will
be
revealed
and
made
manifest
naught
but
the
celestial
potency
of
the
word
of
god
which
ruleth
and
transcendeth
the
realities
of
all
things
is
capable
of
harmonizing
the
divergent
thoughts
sentiments
ideas
and
convictions
of
the
children
of
men
therefore
the
believers
of
god
throughout
all
the
republics
of
america
through
the
divine
power
must
become
the
cause
of
the
promotion
of
heavenly
teachings
and
the
establishment
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
every
one
of
the
important
souls
must
arise
blowing
over
all
parts
of
america
the
breath
of
life
conferring
upon
the
people
a
new
spirit
baptizing
them
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
the
water
of
life
and
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
so
that
the
second
birth
may
become
realized
for
it
is
written
in
the
gospel
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
therefore
o
ye
believers
of
god
in
the
united
states
and
canada
select
ye
important
personages
or
else
they
by
themselves
becoming
severed
from
rest
and
composure
of
the
world
may
arise
and
travel
throughout
alaska
the
republic
of
mexico
and
south
of
mexico
in
the
central
american
republics
such
as
guatemala
honduras
salvador
nicaragua
costa
rica
panama
and
belize
and
through
the
great
south
american
republics
such
as
argentina
uruguay
paraguay
brazil
french
guiana
dutch
guiana
british
guiana
venezuela
ecuador
peru
bolivia
and
chile
also
in
the
group
of
the
west
indies
islands
such
as
cuba
haiti
puerto
rico
jamaica
and
santo
domingo
and
the
group
of
islands
of
the
lesser
antilles
the
islands
of
bahama
and
the
islands
of
bermuda
likewise
to
the
islands
to
the
east
west
and
north
of
south
america
such
as
trinidad
falkland
islands
galapagos
islands
juan
fernandez
and
tobago
visit
ye
especially
the
city
of
bahia
on
the
eastern
shore
of
brazil
because
in
the
past
years
this
city
was
christened
with
the
name
bahia
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
has
been
through
the
inspiration
of
the
holy
spirit
consequently
the
believers
of
god
must
display
the
utmost
effort
upraise
the
divine
melody
throughout
those
regions
promulgate
the
heavenly
teachings
and
waft
over
all
the
spirit
of
eternal
life
so
that
those
republics
may
become
so
illumined
with
the
splendors
and
the
effulgences
of
the
sun
of
reality
that
they
may
become
the
objects
of
the
praise
and
commendation
of
all
other
countries
likewise
ye
must
give
great
attention
to
the
republic
of
panama
for
in
that
point
the
occident
and
the
orient
find
each
other
united
through
the
panama
canal
and
it
is
also
situated
between
the
two
great
oceans
that
place
will
become
very
important
in
the
future
the
teachings
once
established
there
will
unite
the
east
and
the
west
the
north
and
the
south
hence
the
intention
must
be
purified
the
effort
ennobled
and
exalted
so
that
you
may
establish
affinity
between
the
hearts
of
the
world
of
humanity
this
glorious
aim
will
not
become
realized
save
through
the
promotion
of
divine
teachings
which
are
the
foundations
of
the
holy
religions
consider
how
the
religions
of
god
served
the
world
of
humanity
how
the
religion
of
torah
became
conducive
to
the
glory
and
honor
and
progress
of
the
israelitish
nation
how
the
breaths
of
the
holy
spirit
of
his
holiness
christ
created
affinity
and
unity
between
divergent
communities
and
quarreling
families
how
the
sacred
power
of
his
holiness
muhammad
became
the
means
of
uniting
and
harmonizing
the
contentious
tribes
and
the
different
clans
of
peninsular
arabiato
such
an
extent
that
one
thousand
tribes
were
welded
into
one
tribe
strife
and
discord
were
done
away
with
all
of
them
unitedly
and
with
one
accord
strove
in
advancing
the
cause
of
culture
and
civilization
and
thus
were
freed
from
the
lowest
degree
of
degradation
soaring
toward
the
height
of
everlasting
glory
is
it
possible
to
find
a
greater
collective
center
in
the
phenomenal
world
than
this
in
comparison
to
this
divine
collective
center
the
national
collective
center
the
patriotic
collective
center
the
political
collective
center
and
the
cultural
and
intellectual
collective
center
are
like
childs
play
now
strive
ye
that
the
collective
center
of
the
sacred
religionsfor
the
inculcation
of
which
all
the
prophets
were
manifested
and
which
is
no
other
than
the
spirit
of
the
divine
teachingsbe
spread
in
all
parts
of
america
so
that
each
one
of
you
may
shine
forth
from
the
horizon
of
reality
like
unto
the
morning
star
divine
illumination
may
overcome
the
darkness
of
nature
and
the
world
of
humanity
may
become
enlightened
this
is
the
most
great
work
should
you
become
confirmed
therein
this
world
will
become
another
world
the
surface
of
the
earth
will
become
the
delectable
paradise
and
eternal
institutions
be
founded
let
whosoever
travels
to
different
parts
to
teach
peruse
over
mountain
desert
land
and
sea
this
supplication
o
god
o
god
thou
seest
my
weakness
lowliness
and
humility
before
thy
creatures
nevertheless
i
have
trusted
in
thee
and
have
arisen
in
the
promotion
of
thy
teachings
among
thy
strong
servants
relying
on
thy
power
and
might
o
lord
i
am
a
brokenwinged
bird
and
desire
to
soar
in
thy
limitless
space
how
is
it
possible
for
me
to
do
this
save
through
thy
providence
and
grace
thy
confirmation
and
assistance
o
lord
have
pity
on
my
weakness
and
strengthen
me
with
thy
power
o
lord
have
pity
on
my
impotence
and
assist
me
with
thy
might
and
majesty
o
lord
should
the
breath
of
the
holy
spirit
confirm
the
weakest
of
creatures
he
would
attain
all
to
which
he
aspireth
and
would
possess
anything
he
desireth
indeed
thou
hast
assisted
thy
servants
in
the
past
and
though
they
were
the
weakest
of
thy
creatures
the
lowliest
of
thy
servants
and
the
most
insignificant
of
those
who
lived
upon
the
earth
through
thy
sanction
and
potency
they
took
precedence
over
the
most
glorious
of
thy
people
and
the
most
noble
of
mankind
whereas
formerly
they
were
as
moths
they
became
as
royal
falcons
and
whereas
before
they
were
as
brooks
they
became
as
seas
through
thy
bestowal
and
thy
mercy
they
became
through
thy
most
great
favor

of

touching
the

known

and
the
true
nature
of

diverse

and
various
accounts
are
contained
in

chronicles
but
because
of
the
variety
of
their
assertions
and
the
diversity
of
their
narratives
not
one
is
as
worthy
of
confidence
as
it
should
be
some
have
loosed
their
tongues
in
extreme
censure
and
condemnation
some
foreign
chronicles
have
spoken
in
a
commendatory
strain
while
a
certain
section
have
recorded
what
they
themselves
have
heard
without
addressing
themselves
either
to
censure
or
approbation
now
since
these
various
accounts
are
recorded
in

and
since
the
setting
forth
thereof
would
lead
to
prolixity
therefore
what
relates
to
the

of

sought
out
with
the
utmost
diligence
during
the
time
of
my
travels
in
all
parts
of
persia
whether
far
or

from
those

shall

the

may
be
at

who
are

acquainted
with
all
events
the
bab
was
a
young
merchant
of
the
pure
lineage
he
was
born
in
the
year
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
thirtyfive
ah
on
the
first
day
of
muharram
and
when
after
a
few
years
his
father
siyyid
muhammadrida
died
he
was
brought
up
in
shiraz
in
the
arms
of
his
maternal
uncle
mirza
siyyid
ali
the
merchant
on
attaining
maturity
he
engaged
in
trade
in
bushihr
first
in
partnership
with
his
maternal
uncle
and
afterwards
independently
on
account
of
what
was
observed
in
him
he
was
noted
for
godliness
devoutness
virtue
and
piety
and
was
regarded
in
the
sight
of
men
as
so
characterized
in
the
year
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixty
ah
when
he
was
in
his
twentyfifth
year
certain
signs
became
apparent
in
his
conduct
behavior
manners
and
demeanor
whereby
it
became
evident
in
shiraz
that
he
had
some
conflict
in
his
mind
and
some
other
flight
beneath
his
wing
he
began
to
speak
and
to
declare
the
rank
of
babhood
now
what
he
intended
by
the
term
bab
gate
was
this
that
he
was
the
channel
of
grace
from
some
great
person
still
behind
the
veil
of
glory
who
was
the
possessor
of
countless
and
boundless
perfections
by
whose
will
he
moved
and
to
the
bond
of
whose
love
he
clung
and
in
the
first
book
which
he
wrote
in
explanation
of
the
surih
of
joseph
he
addressed
himself
in
all
passages
to
that
person
unseen
from
whom
he
received
help
and
grace
sought
for
aid
in
the
arrangement
of
his
preliminaries
and
craved
the
sacrifice
of
life
in
the
way
of
his
love
amongst
others
is
this
sentence
o
remnant
of
god
i
am
wholly
sacrificed
to
thee
i
am
content
with
curses
in
thy
way
i
crave
naught
but
to
be
slain
in
thy
love
and
god
the
supreme
sufficeth
as
an
eternal
protection
he
likewise
composed
a
number
of
works
in
explanation
and
elucidation
of
the
verses
of
the
quran
of
sermons
and
of
prayers
in
arabic
inciting
and
urging
men
to
expect
the
appearance
of
that
person
and
these
books
he
named
inspired
pages
and
word
of
conscience
but
on
investigation
it
was
discovered
that
he
laid
no
claim
to
revelation
from
an
angel
now
since
he
was
noted
amongst
the
people
for
lack
of
instruction
and
education
this
circumstance
appeared
in
the
sight
of
men
supernatural
some
men
inclined
to
him
but
the
greater
part
manifested
strong
disapproval
whilst
all
the
learned
doctors
and
lawyers
of
repute
who
occupied
chairs
altars
and
pulpits
were
unanimously
agreed
on
eradication
and
suppression
save
some
divines
of
the
shaykhi
party
who
were
anchorites
and
recluses
and
who
agreeably
to
their
tenets
were
ever
seeking
for
some
great
incomparable
and
trustworthy
person
whom
they
accounted
according
to
their
own
terminology
as
the
fourth
support
and
the
central
manifestation
of
the
truths
of
the
perspicuous
religion
of
this
number
mulla
husayn
of
bushruyih
mirza
ahmad
of
azghand
mulla
sadiq
muqaddas
the
holy
shaykh
abuturab
of
ishtihard
mulla
yusuf
of
ardibil
mulla
jalil
of
urumiyyih
mulla
mihdi
of
kand
shaykh
said
the
indian
mulla
ali
of
bastam
and
the
like
of
these
came
out
unto
him
and
spread
themselves
through
all
parts
of
persia
the
bab
himself
set
out
to
perform
the
circumambulation
of
the
house
of
god
on
his
return
when
the
news
of
his
arrival
at
bushihr
reached
shiraz
there
was
much
discussion
and
a
strange
excitement
and
agitation
became
apparent
in
that
city
the
great
majority
of
the
doctors
set
themselves
to
repudiate
him
decreeing
slaughter
and
destruction
and
they
induced
husayn
khan
ajudanbashi
who
was
the
governor
of
fars
to
inflict
a
beating
on
the
babs
missionaries
that
is
on
mulla
sadiq
muqaddas
then
having
burnt
his
moustaches
and
beard
together
with
those
of
mirza
muhammadali
of
barfurush
and
mulla
aliakbar
of
ardistan
they
put
halters
on
all
the
three
and
led
them
round
the
streets
and
bazaars
now
since
the
doctors
of
persia
have
no
administrative
capacity
they
thought
that
violence
and
interference
would
cause
extinction
and
silence
and
lead
to
suppression
and
oblivion
whereas
interference
in
matters
of
conscience
causes
stability
and
firmness
and
attracts
the
attention
of
mens
sight
and
souls
which
fact
has
received
experimental
proof
many
times
and
often
so
this
punishment
caused
notoriety
and
most
men
fell
to
making
inquiry
the
governor
of
fars
acting
according
to
that
which
the
doctors
deemed
expedient
sent
several
horsemen
caused
the
bab
to
be
brought
before
him
censured
and
blamed
him
in
the
presence
of
the
doctors
and
scholars
and
loosed
his
tongue
in
the
demand
for
reparation
and
when
the
bab
returned
his
censure
and
withstood
him
greatly
at
a
sign
from
the
president
they
struck
him
a
violent
blow
insulting
and
contemning
him
in
such
wise
that
his
turban
fell
from
his
head
and
the
mark
of
the
blow
was
apparent
on
his
face
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meeting
they
decided
to
take
counsel
and
on
receiving
bail
and
surety
from
his
maternal
uncle
haji
siyyid
ali
sent
him
to
his
house
forbidding
him
to
hold
intercourse
with
relations
or
strangers
one
day
they
summoned
him
to
the
mosque
urging
and
constraining
him
to
recant
but
he
discoursed
from
the
pulpit
in
such
wise
as
to
silence
and
subdue
those
present
and
to
stablish
and
strengthen
his
followers
it
was
then
supposed
that
he
claimed
to
be
the
medium
of
grace
from
his
highness
the
lord
of
the
age
upon
him
be
peace
but
afterwards
it
became
known
and
evident
that
his
meaning
was
the
gatehood
babiyyat
of
another
city
and
the
mediumship
of
the
graces
of
another
person
whose
qualities
and
attributes
were
contained
in
his
books
and
treatises
at
all
events
as
has
been
mentioned
by
reason
of
the
doctors
lack
of
experience
and
skill
in
administrative
science
and
the
continual
succession
of
their
decisions
comment
was
rife
and
their
interference
with
the
bab
cast
a
clamor
throughout
persia
causing
increased
ardor
in
friends
and
the
coming
forward
of
the
hesitating
for
by
reason
of
these
occurrences
mens
interest
increased
and
in
all
parts
of
persia
some
of
gods
servants
inclined
toward
him
until
the
matter
acquired
such
importance
that
the
late
king
muhammad
shah
delegated
a
certain
person
named
siyyid
yahya
of
darab
who
was
one
of
the
best
known
of
doctors
and
siyyids
as
well
as
an
object
of
veneration
and
confidence
giving
him
a
horse
and
money
for
the
journey
so
that
he
might
proceed
to
shiraz
and
personally
investigate
this
matter
when
the
abovementioned
siyyid
arrived
at
shiraz
he
interviewed
the
bab
three
times
in
the
first
and
second
conferences
questioning
and
answering
took
place
in
the
third
conference
he
requested
a
commentary
on
the
surih
called
kawthar
and
when
the
bab
without
thought
or
reflection
wrote
an
elaborate
commentary
on
the
kawthar
in
his
presence
the
abovementioned
siyyid
was
charmed
and
enraptured
with
him
and
straightway
without
consideration
for
the
future
or
anxiety
about
the
results
of
this
affection
hastened
to
burujird
to
his
father
siyyid
jafar
known
as
kashfi
and
acquainted
him
with
the
matter
and
although
he
was
wise
and
prudent
and
was
wont
to
have
regard
to
the
requirements
of
the
time
he
wrote
without
fear
or
care
a
detailed
account
of
his
observations
to
mirza
lutfali
the
chamberlain
in
order
that
the
latter
might
submit
it
to
the
notice
of
the
late
king
while
he
himself
journeyed
to
all
parts
of
persia
and
in
every
town
and
station
summoned
the
people
from
the
pulpittops
in
such
wise
that
other
learned
doctors
decided
that
he
must
be
mad
accounting
it
a
sure
case
of
bewitchment
now
when
the
news
of
the
decisions
of
the
doctors
and
the
outcry
and
clamor
of
the
lawyers
reached
zanjan
mulla
muhammadali
the
divine
who
was
a
man
of
mark
possessed
of
penetrating
speech
sent
one
of
those
on
whom
he
could
rely
to
shiraz
to
investigate
this
matter
this
person
having
acquainted
himself
with
the
details
of
these
occurrences
in
such
wise
as
was
necessary
and
proper
returned
with
some
of
the
babs
writings
when
the
divine
heard
how
matters
were
and
had
made
himself
acquainted
with
the
writings
notwithstanding
that
he
was
a
man
expert
in
knowledge
and
noted
for
profound
research
he
went
mad
and
became
crazed
as
was
predestined
he
gathered
up
his
books
in
the
lectureroom
saying
the
season
of
spring
and
wine
has
arrived
and
uttered
this
sentence
search
for
knowledge
after
reaching
the
known
is
culpable
then
from
the
summit
of
the
pulpit
he
summoned
and
directed
all
his
disciples
to
embrace
the
doctrine
and
wrote
to
the
bab
his
own
declaration
and
confession
the
bab
in
his
reply
signified
to
him
the
obligation
of
congregational
prayer
although
the
doctors
of
zanjan
arose
with
heart
and
soul
to
exhort
and
admonish
the
people
they
could
effect
nothing
finally
they
were
compelled
to
go
to
tihran
and
made
their
complaint
before
the
late
king
muhammad
shah
requesting
that
mulla
muhammadali
might
be
summoned
to
tihran
so
the
royal
order
went
forth
that
he
should
appear
now
when
he
came
to
tihran
they
brought
him
before
a
conclave
of
the
doctors
but
so
they
relate
after
many
controversies
and
disputations
naught
was
effected
with
him
in
that
assembly
the
late
king
therefore
bestowed
on
him
a
staff
and
fifty
tumans
for
his
expenses
and
gave
him
permission
to
return
at
all
events
this
news
being
disseminated
through
all
parts
and
regions
of
persia
and
several
proselytes
arriving
in
fars
the
doctors
perceived
that
the
matter
had
acquired
importance
that
the
power
to
deal
with
it
had
escaped
from
their
hands
and
that
imprisonment
beating
tormenting
and
contumely
were
fruitless
so
they
signified
to
the
governor
of
fars
husayn
khan
if
thou
desirest
the
extinction
of
this
fire
or
seekest
a
firm
stopper
for
this
rent
and
disruption
an
immediate
cure
and
decisive
remedy
is
to
kill
the
bab
and
the
bab
has
assembled
a
great
host
and
meditates
a
rising
so
husayn
khan
ordered
abdulhamid
khan
the
high
constable
to
attack
the
house
of
the
babs
maternal
uncle
at
midnight
on
all
sides
and
to
bring
him
and
all
his
followers
handcuffed
but
abdulhamid
khan
and
his
hosts
found
no
one
in
the
house
save
the
bab
his
maternal
uncle
and
siyyid
kazim
of
zanjan
and
as
it
chanced
that
on
that
night
the
sickness
of
the
plague
and
the
extreme
heat
of
the
weather
had
compelled
husayn
khan
to
flee
he
released
the
bab
on
condition
of
his
quitting
the
city
on
the
morning
after
that
night
the
bab
with
siyyid
kazim
of
zanjan
set
out
from
shiraz
for
isfahan
before
reaching
isfahan
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
mutamiduddawlih
the
governor
of
the
province
requesting
a
lodging
in
some
suitable
place
with
the
sanction
of
the
government
the
governor
appointed
the
mansion
of
the
imamjumih
there
he
abode
forty
days
and
one
day
agreeably
to
the
request
of
the
imam
he
wrote
without
reflection
a
commentary
on
the
surih
of
valasr
before
the
company
when
this
news
reached
the
mutamid
he
sought
an
interview
with
him
and
questioned
him
concerning
the
special
mission
at
that
same
interview
an
answer
proving
the
special
mission
was
written
the
mutamid
then
gave
orders
that
all
the
doctors
should
assemble
and
dispute
with
him
in
one
conclave
and
that
the
discussion
should
be
faithfully
recorded
without
alteration
by
the
instrumentality
of
his
private
secretary
in
order
that
it
might
be
sent
to
tihran
and
that
whatever
the
royal
edict
and
decree
should
ordain
might
be
carried
out
the
doctors
however
considering
this
arrangement
as
a
weakening
of
the
law
did
not
agree
but
held
a
conclave
and
wrote
if
there
be
doubt
in
the
matter
there
is
need
of
assembly
and
discussion
but
as
this
persons
disagreement
with
the
most
luminous
law
is
clearer
than
the
sun
therefore
the
best
possible
thing
is
to
put
in
practice
the
sentence
of
the
law
the
mutamid
then
desired
to
hold
the
assembled
conference
in
his
own
presence
so
that
the
actual
truth
might
be
disclosed
and
hearts
be
at
peace
but
these
learned
doctors
and
honorable
scholars
unwilling
to
bring
the
perspicuous
law
into
contempt
did
not
approve
discussion
and
controversy
with
a
young
merchant
with
the
exception
of
that
most
erudite
sage
aqa
muhammadmihdi
and
that
eminent
platonist
mirza
hasan
of
nur
so
the
conference
terminated
in
questionings
on
certain
points
relating
to
the
science
of
fundamental
dogma
and
the
elucidation
and
analysis
of
the
doctrines
of
mulla
sadra
so
as
no
conclusion
was
arrived
at
by
the
governor
from
this
conference
the
severe
sentence
and
harsh
decision
of
the
learned
doctors
was
not
carried
out
but
anxious
to
abate
the
great
anxiety
quickly
and
prevent
a
public
tumult
effectually
he
gave
currency
to
a
report
that
a
decree
had
been
issued
ordering
the
bab
to
be
sent
to
tihran
in
order
that
some
decisive
settlement
might
be
arrived
at
or
that
some
courageous
divine
might
be
able
to
confute
him
he
accordingly
sent
him
forth
from
isfahan
with
a
company
of
his
own
mounted
bodyguard
but
when
they
reached
murchihkhar
he
gave
secret
orders
for
his
return
to
isfahan
where
he
afforded
him
a
refuge
and
asylum
in
his
own
roofed
private
quarters
and
not
a
soul
save
the
confidential
and
trusty
dependents
of
the
mutamid
knew
aught
of
the
bab
a
period
of
four
months
passed
in
this
fashion
and
the
mutamid
passed
away
to
the
mercy
of
god
gurgin
khan
the
mutamids
nephew
was
aware
of
the
babs
being
in
the
private
apartments
and
represented
the
matter
to
the
prime
minister
haji
mirza
aqasi
that
celebrated
minister
issued
a
decisive
command
and
gave
instructions
that
they
should
send
the
bab
secretly
in
disguise
under
the
escort
of
nusayri
horsemen
to
the
capital
when
he
reached
kinargird
a
fresh
order
came
from
the
prime
minister
appointing
the
village
of
kulayn
as
an
abode
and
dwellingplace
there
he
remained
for
a
period
of
twenty
days
after
that
the
bab
forwarded
a
letter
to
the
royal
presence
craving
audience
to
set
forth
the
truth
of
his
condition
expecting
this
to
be
a
means
for
the
attainment
of
great
advantages
the
prime
minister
did
not
admit
this
and
made
representation
to
the
royal
presence
the
royal
cavalcade
is
on
the
point
of
starting
and
to
engage
in
such
matters
as
the
present
will
conduce
to
the
disruption
of
the
kingdom
neither
is
there
any
doubt
that
the
most
notable
doctors
of
the
capital
also
will
behave
after
the
fashion
of
the
doctors
of
isfahan
which
thing
will
be
the
cause
of
a
popular
outbreak
or
that
according
to
the
religion
of
the
immaculate
imam
they
will
regard
the
blood
of
this
siyyid
as
of
no
account
yea
as
more
lawful
than
mothers
milk
the
imperial
train
is
prepared
for
travel
neither
is
there
hindrance
or
impediment
in
view
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
presence
of
the
bab
will
be
the
cause
of
the
gravest
trouble
and
the
greatest
mischief
therefore
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
wisest
plan
is
this
to
place
this
person
in
the
castle
of
maku
during
the
period
of
absence
of
the
royal
train
from
the
seat
of
the
imperial
throne
and
to
defer
the
obtaining
of
an
audience
to
the
time
of
return
agreeably
to
this
view
a
letter
was
issued
addressed
to
the
bab
in
his
majestys
own
writing
and
according
to
the
traditional
account
of
the
tenor
of
this
letter
the
epitome
thereof
is
this
after
the
titles
since
the
royal
train
is
on
the
verge
of
departure
from
tihran
to
meet
in
a
befitting
manner
is
impossible
do
you
go
to
maku
and
there
abide
and
rest
for
a
while
engaged
in
praying
for
our
victorious
state
and
we
have
arranged
that
under
all
circumstances
they
shall
show
you
attention
and
respect
when
we
return
from
travel
we
will
summon
you
specially
after
this
they
sent
him
off
with
several
mounted
guards
amongst
them
muhammad
big
the
courier
to
tabriz
and
maku
besides
this
the
followers
of
the
bab
recount
certain
messages
conveyed
from
him
by
the
instrumentality
of
muhammad
big
amongst
which
was
a
promise
to
heal
the
foot
of
the
late
king
but
on
condition
of
an
interview
and
the
suppression
of
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
and
the
prime
ministers
prevention
of
the
conveyance
of
these
letters
to
the
royal
presence
for
he
himself
laid
claim
to
be
a
spiritual
guide
and
was
prepared
to
perform
the
functions
of
religious
directorship
but
others
deny
these
accounts
at
all
events
in
the
course
of
the
journey
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
prime
minister
saying
you
summoned
me
from
isfahan
to
meet
the
doctors
and
for
the
attainment
of
a
decisive
settlement
what
has
happened
now
that
this
excellent
intention
has
been
changed
for
maku
and
tabriz
although
he
remained
forty
days
in
the
city
of
tabriz
the
learned
doctors
did
not
condescend
to
approach
him
and
did
not
deem
it
right
to
meet
him
then
they
sent
him
off
to
the
castle
of
maku
and
for
nine
months
lodged
him
in
the
inaccessible
castle
which
is
situated
on
the
summit
of
that
lofty
mountain
and
ali
khan
of
maku
because
of
his
excessive
love
for
the
family
of
the
prophet
paid
him
such
attention
as
was
possible
and
gave
permission
to
some
persons
to
converse
with
him
now
when
the
accomplished
divines
of
adhirbayjan
perceived
that
in
all
the
parts
round
about
tabriz
it
was
as
though
the
last
day
had
come
by
reason
of
the
excessive
clamor
they
requested
the
government
to
punish
the
babs
followers
and
to
remove
the
bab
to
the
castle
of
chihriq
so
they
sent
him
to
that
castle
and
consigned
him
to
the
keeping
of
yahya
khan
the
kurd
glory
be
to
god
notwithstanding
these
decisions
of
great
doctors
and
reverend
lawyers
and
severe
punishments
and
reprimandsbeatings
banishments
and
imprisonmentson
the
part
of
governors
this
sect
was
daily
on
the
increase
and
the
discussion
and
disputation
was
such
that
in
meetings
and
assemblies
in
all
parts
of
persia
there
was
no
conversation
but
on
this
topic
great
was
the
commotion
which
arose
the
doctors
of
the
perspicuous
religion
were
lamenting
the
common
folk
clamorous
and
agitated
and
the
friends
rejoicing
and
applauding
but
the
bab
himself
attached
no
importance
to
this
uproar
and
tumult
and
alike
on
the
road
and
in
the
castles
of
maku
and
chihriq
evening
and
morning
nay
day
and
night
in
extremest
rapture
and
amazement
he
would
restrict
himself
to
repeating
and
meditating
on
the
qualities
and
attributes
of
that
absentyetpresent
regardedandregarding
person
of
his
thus
he
makes
a
mention
of
him
whereof
this
is
the
purport
though
the
ocean
of
woe
rageth
on
every
side
and
the
bolts
of
fate
follow
in
quick
succession
and
the
darkness
of
griefs
and
afflictions
invade
soul
and
body
yet
is
my
heart
brightened
by
the
remembrance
of
thy
countenance
and
my
soul
is
as
a
rosegarden
from
the
perfume
of
thy
nature
in
short
after
he
had
remained
for
three
months
in
the
castle
of
chihriq
the
eminent
doctors
of
tabriz
and
scholars
of
adhirbayjan
wrote
to
tihran
and
demanded
a
severe
punishment
in
regard
to
the
bab
for
the
intimidation
and
frightening
of
the
people
when
the
prime
minister
haji
mirza
aqasi
beheld
the
ferment
and
clamor
of
the
learned
doctors
in
all
districts
of
persia
he
perforce
became
their
accomplice
and
ordered
him
to
be
brought
from
chihriq
to
tabriz
in
the
course
of
his
transit
by
urumiyyih
the
governor
of
the
district
qasim
mirza
treated
him
with
extraordinary
deference
and
a
strange
flocking
together
of
high
and
low
was
apparent
these
conducted
themselves
with
the
utmost
respectfulness
when
the
bab
reached
tabriz
they
brought
him
after
some
days
before
the
government
tribunal
of
the
learned
doctors
the
nizamululama
mulla
muhammadimamaqani
mirza
ahmad
the
imamjumih
mirza
aliasghar
the
shaykhulislam
and
several
other
divines
were
present
they
asked
concerning
the
claims
of
the
bab
he
advanced
the
claim
of
mihdihood
whereon
a
mighty
tumult
arose
eminent
doctors
in
overwhelming
might
compassed
him
on
all
sides
and
such
was
the
onset
of
orthodoxy
that
it
had
been
no
great
wonder
if
a
mere
youth
had
not
withstood
the
mountain
of
elburz
they
demanded
proof
without
hesitation
he
recited
texts
saying
this
is
the
permanent
and
most
mighty
proof
they
criticized
his
grammar
he
adduced
arguments
from
the
quran
setting
forth
therefrom
instances
of
similar
infractions
of
the
rules
of
grammar
so
the
assembly
broke
up
and
the
bab
returned
to
his
own
dwelling
the
heavencradled
crownprince
was
at
that
time
governor
of
adhirbayjan
he
pronounced
no
sentence
with
regard
to
the
bab
nor
did
he
desire
to
interfere
with
him
the
doctors
however
considered
it
advisable
at
least
to
inflict
a
severe
chastisement
and
beating
was
decided
on
but
none
of
the
corps
of
farrashes
would
agree
to
become
the
instruments
of
the
infliction
of
this
punishment
so
mirza
aliasghar
the
shaykhulislam
who
was
one
of
the
noble
siyyids
brought
him
to
his
own
house
and
applied
the
rods
with
his
own
hand
after
this
they
sent
the
bab
back
to
chihriq
and
subjected
him
to
a
strict
confinement
now
when
the
news
of
this
beating
chastisement
imprisonment
and
rigor
reached
all
parts
of
persia
learned
divines
and
esteemed
lawyers
who
were
possessed
of
power
and
influence
girt
up
the
loins
of
endeavor
for
the
eradication
and
suppression
of
this
sect
exerting
their
utmost
efforts
therefore
and
they
wrote
notice
of
their
decision
to
wit
that
this
person
and
his
followers
are
in
absolute
error
and
are
hurtful
to
church
and
state
and
since
the
governors
in
persia
enjoyed
the
fullest
authority
in
some
provinces
they
followed
this
decision
and
united
in
uprooting
and
dispersing
the
babis
but
the
late
king
muhammad
shah
acted
with
deliberation
in
this
matter
reflecting
this
youth
is
of
the
pure
lineage
and
of
the
family
of
him
addressed
with
were
it
not
for
thee
so
long
as
no
offensive
actions
which
are
incompatible
with
the
public
peace
and
wellbeing
proceed
from
him
the
government
should
not
interfere
with
him
and
whenever
the
learned
doctors
appealed
to
him
from
the
surrounding
districts
he
either
gave
no
answer
or
else
commanded
them
to
act
with
deliberation
notwithstanding
this
between
eminent
doctors
and
illustrious
scholars
and
those
learned
persons
who
were
followers
of
the
bab
opposition
discussion
and
strife
did
so
increase
that
in
some
provinces
they
desired
to
resort
to
mutual
imprecation
and
for
the
governors
of
the
provinces
too
a
means
of
acquiring
gain
was
produced
so
that
great
tumult
and
disturbance
arose
and
since
the
malady
of
the
gout
had
violently
attacked
the
kings
foot
and
occupied
his
worldordering
thought
the
good
judgment
of
the
chief
minister
the
famous
haji
mirza
aqasi
became
the
pivot
of
the
conduct
of
affairs
and
his
incapacity
and
lack
of
resource
became
apparent
as
the
sun
for
every
hour
he
formed
a
new
opinion
and
gave
a
new
order
at
one
moment
he
would
seek
to
support
the
decision
of
the
doctors
accounting
the
eradication
and
suppression
of
the
babis
as
necessary
at
another
time
he
would
charge
the
doctors
with
aggressiveness
regarding
undue
interference
as
contrary
to
justice
at
another
time
he
would
become
a
mystic
and
say
all
these
voices
are
from
the
king
or
repeat
with
his
tongue
moses
is
at
war
with
moses
or
recite
this
is
nought
but
thy
trial
in
short
this
changeable
minister
by
reason
of
his
mismanagement
of
important
matters
and
failure
to
control
and
order
the
affairs
of
the
community
so
acted
that
disturbance
and
clamor
arose
from
all
quarters
and
directions
the
most
notable
and
influential
of
the
doctors
ordered
the
common
folk
to
molest
the
followers
of
the
bab
and
a
general
onslaught
took
place
more
especially
when
the
claim
of
mihdihood
reached
the
hearing
of
eminent
divines
and
profound
doctors
they
began
to
make
lamentation
and
to
cry
and
complain
from
their
pulpits
saying
one
of
the
essentials
of
religion
and
of
the
authentic
traditions
transmitted
from
the
holy
imams
nay
the
chief
basis
of
the
foundations
of
the
church
of
his
highness
jafar
is
the
occultation
of
the
immaculate
twelfth
imam
upon
both
of
them
be
peace
what
has
happened
to
jabulqa
where
has
jabulsa
gone
what
was
the
minor
occultation
what
has
become
of
the
major
occultation
what
are
the
sayings
of
husayn
ibn
ruh
and
what
the
tradition
of
ibn
mihriyar
what
shall
we
make
of
the
flight
of
the
guardians
and
the
helpers
how
shall
we
deal
with
the
conquest
of
the
east
and
the
west
where
is
the
ass
of
antichrist
when
will
the
appearance
of
the
sufyan
be
where
are
the
signs
which
are
in
the
traditions
of
the
holy
family
where
is
that
whereon
the
victorious
church
is
agreed
the
matter
is
not
outside
one
of
two
alternatives
either
we
must
repudiate
the
traditions
of
the
holy
imams
grow
wearied
of
the
church
of
jafar
and
account
the
clear
indications
of
the
imam
as
disturbed
dreams
or
in
accordance
with
the
primary
and
subsidiary
doctrines
of
the
faith
and
the
essential
and
explicit
declarations
of
the
most
luminous
law
we
must
consider
the
repudiation
nay
the
destruction
of
this
person
as
our
chief
duty
if
so
be
that
we
shut
our
eyes
to
these
authentic
traditions
and
obvious
doctrines
universally
admitted
no
remnant
will
endure
of
the
fundamental
basis
of
the
church
of
the
immaculate
imam
we
shall
neither
be
sunnites
nor
shall
we
be
of
the
prevalent
sect
to
continue
awaiting
the
promised
saint
and
believing
in
the
begotten
mihdi
otherwise
we
must
regard
as
admissible
the
opening
of
the
gate
of
saintship
and
consider
that
he
who
is
to
arise
of
the
family
of
muhammad
possesses
two
signs
the
first
condition
holy
lineage
the
second
that
he
is
divinely
fortified
with
brilliant
verses
what
can
we
do
with
these
thousandyearold
beliefs
of
the
delivered
band
of
shiites
or
what
shall
we
say
concerning
their
profound
doctors
and
preeminent
divines
were
all
these
in
error
did
they
journey
in
the
vale
of
transgression
what
an
evidently
false
assertion
is
this
by
god
this
is
a
thing
to
break
the
back
o
people
extinguish
this
fire
and
forget
these
words
alas
woe
to
our
faith
woe
to
our
law
thus
did
they
make
complaint
in
mosques
and
chapels
in
pulpits
and
congregations
but
the
babi
chiefs
composed
treatises
against
them
and
set
in
order
replies
according
to
their
own
thought
were
these
to
be
discussed
in
detail
it
would
conduce
to
prolixity
and
our
object
is
the
statement
of
history
not
of
arguments
for
believing
or
rejecting
but
of
some
of
the
replies
the
gist
is
this
that
they
held
the
proof
as
supreme
and
the
evidence
as
outweighing
traditions
considering
the
former
as
the
root
and
the
latter
as
the
branch
and
saying
if
the
branch
agree
not
with
the
root
it
serves
not
as
an
argument
and
is
unworthy
of
reliance
for
the
reported
consequence
has
no
right
to
oppose
itself
to
the
established
principle
and
cannot
argue
against
it
indeed
in
such
cases
they
regarded
interpretation
as
the
truth
of
revelation
and
the
essence
of
true
exegesis
thus
for
instance
they
interpreted
the
sovereignty
of
the
qaim
as
a
mystical
sovereignty
and
his
conquests
as
conquests
of
the
cities
of
hearts
adducing
in
support
of
this
the
meekness
and
defeat
of
the
chief
of
martyrs
may
the
life
of
all
being
be
a
sacrifice
for
him
for
he
was
the
true
manifestation
of
the
blessed
verse
and
verily
our
host
shall
overcome
for
them
yet
notwithstanding
this
he
quaffed
the
cup
of
martyrdom
with
perfect
meekness
and
at
the
very
moment
of
uttermost
defeat
triumphed
over
his
enemies
and
became
the
most
mighty
of
the
troops
of
the
supreme
host
similarly
they
regarded
the
numerous
writings
which
in
spite
of
his
lack
of
education
the
bab
had
composed
as
due
to
the
promptings
of
the
holy
spirit
extracted
from
books
contrary
sayings
handed
down
by
men
of
mark
adduced
traditions
apparently
agreeing
with
their
objects
and
clung
to
the
announcements
of
certain
notables
of
yore
they
also
considered
the
conversion
of
austere
and
recluse
doctors
and
eminent
votaries
of
the
perspicuous
religion
of
islam
as
a
valid
proof
deemed
the
steadfastness
and
constancy
of
the
bab
a
most
mighty
sign
and
related
miracles
and
the
like
which
things
being
altogether
foreign
to
our
purpose
we
have
passed
by
with
brevity
and
will
now
proceed
with
our
original
topic
at
the
time
of
these
events
certain
persons
appeared
amongst
the
babis
who
had
a
strange
ascendancy
and
appearance
in
the
eyes
of
this
sect
amongst
these
was
mirza
muhammadali
of
mazindaran
who
was
the
disciple
of
the
illustrious
siyyid
may
god
exalt
his
station
haji
siyyid
kazim
of
rasht
and
who
was
the
associate
and
companion
of
the
bab
in
his
pilgrimage
journey
after
a
while
certain
manners
and
states
issued
from
him
such
that
all
acting
with
absolute
confidence
considered
obedience
to
him
as
an
impregnable
stronghold
so
that
even
mulla
husayn
of
bushruyih
who
was
the
leader
of
all
and
the
arbiter
appealed
to
alike
by
the
noble
and
the
humble
of
this
sect
used
to
behave
in
his
presence
with
great
humility
and
with
the
selfabasement
of
a
lowly
servant
this
personage
set
himself
to
exalt
the
word
of
the
bab
with
the
utmost
steadfastness
and
the
bab
did
full
justice
to
speech
in
praising
and
glorifying
him
accounting
his
uprising
as
an
assistance
from
the
unseen
in
delivery
and
style
he
was
evident
magic
and
in
firmness
and
constancy
superior
to
all
at
length
in
the
year
ah
at
the
sentence
of
the
chief
of
lawyers
the
saidululama
the
chief
divine
of
barfurush
he
yielded
his
head
and
surrendered
his
life
amidst
extremest
clamor
and
outcry
and
amongst
them
was
she
who
was
entitled
qurratulayn
the
daughter
of
haji
salih
the
sage
of
qazvin
the
erudite
doctor
she
according
to
what
is
related
was
skilled
in
diverse
arts
amazed
the
understandings
and
thoughts
of
the
most
eminent
masters
by
her
eloquent
dissertations
on
the
exegesis
and
tradition
of
the
perspicuous
book
and
was
a
mighty
sign
in
the
doctrines
of
the
glorious
shaykh
of
ahsa
at
the
supreme
shrines
she
borrowed
light
on
matters
divine
from
the
lamp
of
kazim
and
freely
sacrificed
her
life
in
the
way
of
the
bab
she
discussed
and
disputed
with
the
doctors
and
sages
loosing
her
tongue
to
establish
her
doctrine
such
fame
did
she
acquire
that
most
people
who
were
scholars
or
mystics
sought
to
hear
her
speech
and
were
eager
to
become
acquainted
with
her
powers
of
speculation
and
deduction
she
had
a
brain
full
of
tumultuous
ideas
and
thoughts
vehement
and
restless
in
many
places
she
triumphed
over
the
contentious
expounding
the
most
subtle
questions
when
she
was
imprisoned
in
the
house
of
mahmud
the
kalantar
of
tihran
and
the
festivities
and
rejoicings
of
a
wedding
were
going
on
the
wives
of
the
city
magnates
who
were
present
as
guests
were
so
charmed
with
the
beauty
of
her
speech
that
forgetting
the
festivities
they
gathered
round
her
diverted
by
listening
to
her
words
from
listening
to
the
melodies
and
rendered
indifferent
by
witnessing
her
marvels
to
the
contemplation
of
the
pleasant
and
novel
sights
which
are
incidental
to
a
wedding
in
short
in
elocution
she
was
the
calamity
of
the
age
and
in
ratiocination
the
trouble
of
the
world
of
fear
or
timidity
there
was
no
trace
in
her
heart
nor
had
the
admonitions
of
the
kindlydisposed
any
profit
or
fruit
for
her
although
she
was
of
such
as
are
damsels
meet
for
the
bridal
bower
yet
she
wrested
preeminence
from
stalwart
men
and
continued
to
strain
the
feet
of
steadfastness
until
she
yielded
up
her
life
at
the
sentence
of
the
mighty
doctors
in
tihran
but
were
we
to
occupy
ourselves
with
these
details
the
matter
would
end
in
prolixity
well
persia
was
in
this
critical
state
and
the
learned
doctors
perplexed
and
anxious
when
the
late
prince
muhammad
shah
died
and
the
throne
of
sovereignty
was
adorned
with
the
person
of
the
new
monarch
mirza
taqi
khan
amirnizam
who
was
prime
minister
and
chief
regent
seized
in
the
grasp
of
his
despotic
power
the
reins
of
the
affairs
of
the
commonwealth
and
urged
the
steed
of
his
ambition
into
the
arena
of
willfulness
and
sole
possession
this
minister
was
a
person
devoid
of
experience
and
wanting
in
consideration
for
the
consequences
of
actions
bloodthirsty
and
shameless
and
swift
and
ready
to
shed
blood
severity
in
punishing
he
regarded
as
wise
administration
and
harshly
entreating
distressing
intimidating
and
frightening
the
people
he
considered
as
a
fulcrum
for
the
advancement
of
the
monarchy
and
as
his
majesty
the
king
was
in
the
prime
of
youthful
years
the
minister
fell
into
strange
fancies
and
sounded
the
drum
of
pages
absolutism
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
on
his
own
decisive
resolution
without
seeking
permission
from
the
royal
presence
or
taking
counsel
with
prudent
statesmen
he
issued
orders
to
persecute
the
babis
imagining
that
by
overweening
force
he
could
eradicate
and
suppress
matters
of
this
nature
and
that
harshness
would
bear
good
fruit
whereas
in
fact
to
interfere
with
matters
of
conscience
is
simply
to
give
them
greater
currency
and
strength
the
more
you
strive
to
extinguish
the
more
will
the
flame
be
kindled
more
especially
in
matters
of
faith
and
religion
which
spread
and
acquire
influence
so
soon
as
blood
is
shed
and
strongly
affect
mens
hearts
these
things
have
been
put
to
the
proof
and
the
greatest
proof
is
this
very
transaction
thus
they
relate
that
the
possessions
of
a
certain
babi
in
kashan
were
plundered
and
his
household
scattered
and
dispersed
they
stripped
him
naked
and
scourged
him
defiled
his
beard
mounted
him
face
backwards
on
an
ass
and
paraded
him
through
the
streets
and
bazaars
with
the
utmost
cruelty
to
the
sound
of
drums
trumpets
guitars
and
tambourines
a
certain
gabr
who
knew
absolutely
naught
of
the
world
or
its
denizens
chanced
to
be
seated
apart
in
a
corner
of
a
caravansary
when
the
clamor
of
the
people
rose
high
he
hastened
into
the
street
and
becoming
cognizant
of
the
offence
and
the
offender
and
the
cause
of
his
public
disgrace
and
punishment
in
full
detail
he
fell
to
making
search
and
that
very
day
entered
the
society
of
the
babis
saying
this
very
illusage
and
public
humiliation
is
a
proof
of
truth
and
the
very
best
of
arguments
had
it
not
been
thus
it
might
have
been
that
a
thousand
years
would
have
passed
ere
one
like
me
became
informed
at
all
events
the
minister
with
the
utmost
arbitrariness
without
receiving
any
instructions
or
asking
permission
sent
forth
commands
in
all
directions
to
punish
and
chastise
the
babis
governors
and
magistrates
sought
a
pretext
for
amassing
wealth
and
officials
a
means
of
acquiring
profits
celebrated
doctors
from
the
summits
of
their
pulpits
incited
men
to
make
a
general
onslaught
the
powers
of
the
religious
and
the
civil
law
linked
hands
and
strove
to
eradicate
and
destroy
this
people
now
this
people
had
not
yet
acquired
such
knowledge
as
was
right
and
needful
of
the
fundamental
principles
and
hidden
doctrines
of
the
babs
teachings
and
did
not
recognize
their
duties
their
conceptions
and
ideas
were
after
the
former
fashion
and
their
conduct
and
behavior
in
correspondence
with
ancient
usage
the
way
of
approach
to
the
bab
was
moreover
closed
and
the
flame
of
trouble
visibly
blazing
on
every
side
at
the
decree
of
the
most
celebrated
of
the
doctors
the
government
and
indeed
the
common
people
had
with
irresistible
power
inaugurated
rapine
and
plunder
on
all
sides
and
were
engaged
in
punishing
and
torturing
killing
and
despoiling
in
order
that
they
might
quench
this
fire
and
wither
these
poor
souls
in
towns
where
these
were
but
a
limited
number
all
of
them
with
bound
hands
became
food
for
the
sword
while
in
cities
where
they
were
numerous
they
arose
in
selfdefense
agreeably
to
their
former
beliefs
since
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
make
inquiry
as
to
their
duty
and
all
doors
were
closed
in
mazindaran
amongst
other
places
the
people
of
the
city
of
barfurush
at
the
command
of
the
chief
of
the
lawyers
the
saidululama
made
a
general
attack
on
mulla
husayn
of
bushruyih
and
his
followers
and
slew
six
or
seven
persons
they
were
busy
compassing
the
destruction
of
the
rest
also
when
mulla
husayn
ordered
the
adhan
to
be
sounded
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
the
sword
whereupon
all
sought
flight
and
the
nobles
and
lords
coming
before
him
with
the
utmost
penitence
and
deference
agreed
that
he
should
be
permitted
to
depart
they
further
sent
with
them
as
a
guard
khusraw
of
qadikala
with
horsemen
and
footmen
so
that
according
to
the
terms
of
the
agreement
they
might
go
forth
safe
and
protected
from
the
territory
of
mazindaran
when
they
being
ignorant
of
the
fords
and
paths
had
emerged
from
the
city
khusraw
dispersed
his
horsemen
and
footmen
and
set
them
in
ambush
in
the
forest
of
mazindaran
scattered
and
separated
the
babis
in
that
forest
on
the
road
and
off
the
road
and
began
to
hunt
them
down
singly
when
the
reports
of
muskets
arose
on
every
side
the
hidden
secret
became
manifest
and
several
wanderers
and
other
persons
were
suddenly
slain
with
bullets
mulla
husayn
ordered
the
adhan
to
be
sounded
to
assemble
his
scattered
followers
while
mirza
lutfali
the
secretary
drew
his
dagger
and
ripped
open
khusraws
vitals
of
khusraws
host
some
were
slain
and
others
wandered
distractedly
over
the
field
of
battle
mulla
husayn
quartered
his
host
in
a
fort
near
the
burialplace
of
shaykh
tabarsi
and
being
aware
of
the
wishes
of
the
community
relaxed
and
interrupted
the
march
this
detachment
was
subsequently
further
reinforced
by
mirza
muhammadali
of
mazindaran
with
a
number
of
other
persons
so
that
the
garrison
of
the
fort
numbered
three
hundred
and
thirteen
souls
of
these
however
all
were
not
capable
of
fighting
only
one
hundred
and
ten
persons
being
prepared
for
war
most
of
them
were
doctors
or
students
whose
companions
had
been
during
their
whole
life
books
and
treatises
yet
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
unaccustomed
to
war
or
to
the
blows
of
shot
and
sword
four
times
were
camps
and
armies
arrayed
against
them
and
they
were
attacked
and
hemmed
in
with
cannons
muskets
and
bombshells
and
on
all
four
occasions
they
inflicted
defeat
while
the
army
was
completely
routed
and
dispersed
on
the
occasion
of
the
fourth
defeat
abbasquli
khan
of
larijan
was
captain
of
the
forces
and
prince
mihdiquli
mirza
commander
in
the
camp
the
khan
above
mentioned
used
at
nights
to
conceal
and
hide
himself
in
disguise
amongst
the
trees
of
the
forest
outside
the
camp
while
during
the
day
he
was
present
in
the
encampment
the
last
battle
took
place
at
night
and
the
army
was
routed
the
babis
fired
the
tents
and
huts
and
night
became
bright
as
day
the
foot
of
mulla
husayns
horse
caught
in
a
noose
for
he
was
riding
the
others
being
on
foot
abbasquli
khan
recognized
him
from
the
top
of
a
tree
afar
off
and
with
his
own
hand
discharged
several
bullets
at
the
third
shot
he
threw
him
from
his
feet
he
was
borne
by
his
followers
to
the
fort
and
there
they
buried
him
notwithstanding
this
event
the
troops
could
not
prevail
by
superior
force
at
length
the
prince
made
a
treaty
and
covenant
and
swore
by
the
holy
imams
confirming
his
oath
by
vows
plighted
on
the
glorious
quran
to
this
effect
you
shall
not
be
molested
return
to
your
own
places
since
their
provisions
had
for
some
time
been
exhausted
so
that
even
of
the
skins
and
bones
of
horses
naught
remained
and
they
had
subsisted
for
several
days
on
pure
water
they
agreed
when
they
arrived
at
the
army
food
was
prepared
for
them
in
a
place
outside
the
camp
they
were
engaged
in
eating
having
laid
aside
their
weapons
and
armor
when
the
soldiers
fell
on
them
on
all
sides
and
slew
them
all
some
have
accounted
this
valor
displayed
by
these
people
as
a
thing
miraculous
but
when
a
band
of
men
are
besieged
in
some
place
where
all
avenues
and
roads
are
stopped
and
all
hope
of
deliverance
is
cut
off
they
will
assuredly
defend
themselves
desperately
and
display
bravery
and
courage
in
zanjan
and
nayriz
likewise
at
the
decree
of
erudite
doctors
and
notable
lawyers
a
bloodthirsty
military
force
attacked
and
besieged
in
zanjan
the
chief
was
mulla
muhammadali
the
mujtahid
while
in
nayriz
siyyid
yahya
of
darab
was
the
leader
and
arbiter
at
first
they
sought
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
but
meeting
with
cruel
ferocity
they
reached
the
pitch
of
desperation
and
the
overpowering
force
of
the
victorious
troops
having
cut
off
every
passage
of
flight
they
unclosed
their
hands
in
resistance
but
although
they
were
very
strong
in
battle
and
amazed
the
chiefs
of
the
army
by
their
steadfastness
and
endurance
the
overwhelming
military
force
closed
the
passage
of
flight
and
broke
their
wings
and
feathers
after
numerous
battles
they
too
at
last
yielded
to
covenants
and
compacts
oaths
and
promises
vows
registered
on
the
quran
and
the
wonderful
stratagems
of
the
officers
and
were
all
put
to
the
edge
of
the
sword
were
we
to
occupy
ourselves
in
detail
with
the
wars
of
nayriz
and
zanjan
or
to
set
forth
these
events
from
beginning
to
end
this
epitome
would
become
a
bulky
volume
so
since
this
would
be
of
no
advantage
to
history
we
have
passed
them
over
briefly
during
the
course
of
the
events
which
took
place
at
zanjan
the
prime
minister
devised
a
final
and
trenchant
remedy
without
the
royal
command
without
consulting
with
the
ministers
of
the
subjectprotecting
court
he
acting
with
arbitrary
disposition
fixed
determination
and
entirely
on
his
own
authority
issued
commands
to
put
the
bab
to
death
this
befell
in
brief
as
follows
the
governor
of
adhirbayjan
prince
hamzih
mirza
was
unwilling
that
the
execution
of
this
sentence
should
be
at
his
hands
and
said
to
the
brother
of
the
amir
mirza
hasan
khan
this
is
a
vile
business
and
an
easy
one
anyone
is
capable
and
competent
i
had
imagined
that
his
excellency
the
regent
would
commission
me
to
make
war
on
the
afghans
or
uzbegs
or
appoint
me
to
attack
and
invade
the
territory
of
russia
or
turkey
so
mirza
hasan
khan
wrote
his
excuse
in
detail
to
the
amir
now
the
siyyid
bab
had
disposed
all
his
affairs
before
setting
out
from
chihriq
towards
tabriz
had
placed
his
writings
and
even
his
ring
and
pencase
in
a
specially
prepared
box
put
the
key
of
the
box
in
an
envelope
and
sent
it
by
means
of
mulla
baqir
who
was
one
of
his
first
associates
to
mulla
abdulkarim
of
qazvin
this
trust
mulla
baqir
delivered
over
to
mulla
abdulkarim
at
qum
in
presence
of
a
numerous
company
at
the
solicitations
of
those
present
he
opened
the
lid
of
the
box
and
said
i
am
commanded
to
convey
this
trust
to
bahaullah
more
than
this
ask
not
of
me
for
i
cannot
tell
you
importuned
by
the
company
he
produced
a
long
epistle
in
blue
penned
in
the
most
graceful
manner
with
the
utmost
delicacy
and
firmness
in
a
beautiful
minute
shikastih
hand
written
in
the
shape
of
a
man
so
closely
that
it
would
have
been
imagined
that
it
was
a
single
wash
of
ink
on
the
paper
when
they
had
read
this
epistle
they
perceived
that
he
had
produced
three
hundred
and
sixty
derivatives
from
the
word
baha
then
mulla
abdulkarim
conveyed
the
trust
to
its
destination
well
we
must
return
to
our
original
narrative
the
prime
minister
issued
a
second
order
to
his
brother
mirza
hasan
khan
the
gist
of
which
order
was
this
obtain
a
formal
and
explicit
sentence
from
the
learned
doctors
of
tabriz
who
are
the
firm
support
of
the
church
of
jafar
upon
him
be
peace
and
the
impregnable
stronghold
of
the
shiite
faith
summon
the
christian
regiment
of
urumiyyih
suspend
the
bab
before
all
the
people
and
give
orders
for
the
regiment
to
fire
a
volley
mirza
hasan
khan
summoned
his
chief
of
the
farrashes
and
gave
him
his
instructions
they
removed
the
babs
turban
and
sash
which
were
the
signs
of
his
siyyidhood
brought
him
with
four
of
his
followers
to
the
barrack
square
of
tabriz
confined
him
in
a
cell
and
appointed
forty
of
the
christian
soldiers
of
tabriz
to
guard
him
next
day
the
chief
of
the
farrashes
delivered
over
the
bab
and
a
young
man
named
aqa
muhammadali
who
was
of
a
noble
family
of
tabriz
to
sam
khan
colonel
of
the
christian
regiment
of
urumiyyih
at
the
sentences
of
the
learned
divine
mulla
muhammad
of
mamaqan
of
the
second
ecclesiastical
authority
mulla
mirza
baqir
and
of
the
third
ecclesiastical
authority
mulla
murtadaquli
and
others
an
iron
nail
was
hammered
into
the
middle
of
the
staircase
of
the
very
cell
wherein
they
were
imprisoned
and
two
ropes
were
hung
down
by
one
rope
the
bab
was
suspended
and
by
the
other
rope
aqa
muhammadali
both
being
firmly
bound
in
such
wise
that
the
head
of
that
young
man
was
on
the
babs
breast
the
surrounding
housetops
billowed
with
teeming
crowds
a
regiment
of
soldiers
ranged
itself
in
three
files
the
first
file
fired
then
the
second
file
and
then
the
third
file
discharged
volleys
from
the
fire
of
these
volleys
a
mighty
smoke
was
produced
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
they
saw
that
young
man
standing
and
the
bab
seated
by
the
side
of
his
amanuensis
aqa
siyyid
husayn
in
the
very
cell
from
the
staircase
of
which
they
had
suspended
them
to
neither
one
of
them
had
the
slightest
injury
resulted
sam
khan
the
christian
asked
to
be
excused
the
turn
of
service
came
to
another
regiment
and
the
chief
of
the
farrashes
withheld
his
hand
aqa
jan
big
of
khamsih
colonel
of
the
bodyguard
advanced
and
they
again
bound
the
bab
together
with
that
young
man
to
the
same
nail
the
bab
uttered
certain
words
which
those
few
who
knew
persian
understood
while
the
rest
heard
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
appeared
in
person
and
it
was
before
noon
on
the
twentyeighth
day
of
shaban
in
the
year
ah
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixtysix
suddenly
he
gave
orders
to
fire
at
this
volley
the
bullets
produced
such
an
effect
that
the
breasts
of
the
victims
were
riddled
and
their
limbs
were
completely
dissected
except
their
faces
which
were
but
little
marred
then
they
removed
those
two
bodies
from
the
square
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
outside
the
city
and
that
night
they
remained
by
the
edge
of
the
moat
next
day
the
russian
consul
came
with
an
artist
and
took
a
picture
of
those
two
bodies
in
the
posture
wherein
they
had
fallen
at
the
edge
of
the
moat
on
the
second
night
at
midnight
the
babis
carried
away
the
two
bodies
on
the
third
day
the
people
did
not
find
the
bodies
and
some
supposed
that
the
wild
beasts
had
devoured
them
so
that
the
doctors
proclaimed
from
the
summits
of
their
pulpits
saying
the
holy
body
of
the
immaculate
imam
and
that
of
the
true
shiite
are
preserved
from
the
encroachments
of
beasts
of
prey
and
creeping
things
and
wounds
but
the
body
of
this
person
have
the
wild
beasts
torn
in
pieces
but
after
the
fullest
investigation
and
inquiry
it
hath
been
proved
that
when
the
bab
had
dispersed
all
his
writings
and
personal
properties
and
it
had
become
clear
and
evident
from
various
signs
that
these
events
would
shortly
take
place
therefore
on
the
second
day
of
these
events
sulayman
khan
the
son
of
yahya
khan
one
of
the
nobles
of
adhirbayjan
devoted
to
the
bab
arrived
and
proceeded
straightway
to
the
house
of
the
mayor
of
tabriz
and
since
the
mayor
was
an
old
friend
associate
and
confidant
of
his
since
moreover
he
was
of
the
mystic
temperament
and
did
not
entertain
aversion
or
dislike
for
any
sect
sulayman
khan
divulged
this
secret
to
him
saying
tonight
i
with
several
others
will
endeavor
by
every
means
and
artifice
to
rescue
the
body
even
though
it
be
not
possible
come
what
may
we
will
make
an
attack
and
either
attain
our
object
or
pour
out
our
lives
freely
in
this
way
such
troubles
answered
the
mayor
are
in
no
wise
necessary
he
then
sent
one
of
his
private
servants
named
haji
allahyar
who
by
whatever
means
and
proceedings
it
was
obtained
the
body
without
trouble
or
difficulty
and
handed
it
over
to
haji
sulayman
khan
and
when
it
was
morning
the
sentinels
to
excuse
themselves
said
that
the
wild
beasts
had
devoured
it
that
night
they
sheltered
the
body
in
the
workshop
of
a
babi
of
milan
next
day
they
manufactured
a
box
placed
it
in
the
box
and
left
it
as
a
trust
afterwards
in
accordance
with
instructions
which
arrived
from
tihran
they
sent
it
away
from
adhirbayjan
and
this
transaction
remained
absolutely
secret
now
in
these
years
ah
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixtysix
and
sixtyseven
throughout
all
persia
fire
fell
on
the
households
of
the
babis
and
each
one
of
them
in
whatever
hamlet
he
might
be
was
on
the
slightest
suspicion
arising
put
to
the
sword
more
than
four
thousand
souls
were
slain
and
a
great
multitude
of
women
and
children
left
without
protector
or
helper
distracted
and
confounded
were
trodden
down
and
destroyed
and
all
these
occurrences
were
brought
about
solely
by
the
arbitrary
decision
and
command
of
mirza
taqi
khan
who
imagined
that
by
the
enactment
of
a
crushing
punishment
this
sect
would
be
dispersed
and
disappear
in
such
wise
that
all
sign
and
knowledge
of
them
would
be
cut
off
ere
long
had
passed
the
contrary
of
his
imagination
appeared
and
it
became
certain
that
the
babis
were
increasing
the
flame
rose
higher
and
the
contagion
became
swifter
the
affair
waxed
grave
and
the
report
thereof
reached
other
climes
at
first
it
was
confined
to
persia
later
it
spread
to
the
rest
of
the
world
quaking
and
affliction
resulted
in
constancy
and
stability
and
grievous
pains
and
punishment
caused
acceptance
and
attraction
the
very
events
produced
an
impression
impression
led
to
investigation
and
investigation
resulted
in
increase
through
the
illconsidered
policy
of
the
minister
this
edifice
became
fortified
and
strengthened
and
these
foundations
firm
and
solid
previously
the
matter
used
to
be
regarded
as
commonplace
subsequently
it
acquired
a
grave
importance
in
mens
eyes
many
persons
from
all
parts
of
the
world
set
out
for
persia
and
began
to
seek
with
their
whole
hearts
for
it
hath
been
proved
by
experience
in
the
world
that
in
the
case
of
such
matters
of
conscience
laceration
causeth
healing
censure
produceth
increased
diligence
prohibition
induceth
eagerness
and
intimidation
createth
avidity
the
root
is
hidden
in
the
very
heart
while
the
branch
is
apparent
and
evident
when
one
branch
is
cut
off
other
branches
grow
thus
it
is
observed
that
when
such
matters
occur
in
other
countries
they
become
extinct
spontaneously
through
lack
of
attention
and
exiguity
of
interest
for
up
to
the
present
moment
of
movements
pertaining
to
religion
many
have
appeared
in
the
countries
of
europe
but
noninterference
and
absence
of
bigotry
having
deprived
them
of
importance
in
a
little
while
they
became
effaced
and
dispelled
after
this
event
there
was
wrought
by
a
certain
babi
a
great
error
and
a
grave
presumption
and
crime
which
has
blackened
the
page
of
the
history
of
this
sect
and
given
it
an
ill
name
throughout
the
civilized
world
of
this
event
the
marrow
is
this
that
during
the
time
when
the
bab
was
residing
in
adhirbayjan
a
youth
sadiq
by
name
became
affected
with
the
utmost
devotion
to
the
bab
night
and
day
was
busy
in
serving
him
and
became
bereft
of
thought
and
reason
now
when
that
which
befell
the
bab
in
tabriz
took
place
this
servant
actuated
by
his
own
fond
fancies
fell
into
thoughts
of
seeking
bloodrevenge
and
since
he
knew
naught
of
the
details
of
the
events
the
absolute
autocracy
of
the
amirnizam
his
unbridled
power
and
sole
authority
nor
was
aware
that
this
sentence
had
been
promulgated
absolutely
without
the
cognizance
of
the
royal
court
and
that
the
prime
minister
had
presumptuously
issued
the
order
on
his
own
sole
responsibility
since
on
the
contrary
he
supposed
that
agreeably
to
ordinary
custom
and
usage
the
attendants
of
the
court
had
had
a
share
in
and
a
knowledge
of
this
sentence
therefore
impelled
by
folly
frenzy
and
his
evil
star
nay
by
sheer
madness
he
rose
up
from
tabriz
and
came
straight
to
tihran
one
other
person
being
his
accomplice
then
since
the
royal
train
had
its
abode
in
shimiran
he
thither
directed
his
steps
god
is
our
refuge
by
him
was
wrought
a
deed
so
presumptuous
that
the
tongue
is
unable
to
declare
and
the
pen
loath
to
describe
it
yet
to
god
be
praise
and
thankfulness
that
this
madman
had
charged
his
pistol
with
shot
imagining
this
to
be
preferable
and
superior
to
all
projectiles
then
all
at
once
commotion
arose
and
this
sect
became
of
such
ill
repute
that
still
strive
and
struggle
as
they
may
to
escape
from
the
curse
and
disgrace
and
dishonor
of
this
deed
they
are
unable
to
do
so
they
will
recount
from
the
first
manifestation
of
the
bab
until
the
present
time
but
when
the
thread
of
the
discourse
reaches
this
event
they
are
abashed
and
hang
their
heads
in
shame
repudiating
the
presumptuous
actor
and
accounting
him
the
destroyer
of
the
edifice
and
the
cause
of
shame
to
mankind
now
after
the
occurrence
of
this
grave
matter
all
of
this
sect
were
suspected
at
first
there
was
neither
investigation
nor
inquiry
but
afterwards
in
mere
justice
it
was
decided
that
there
should
be
investigation
inquiry
and
examination
all
who
were
known
to
be
of
this
sect
fell
under
suspicion
bahaullah
was
passing
the
summer
in
the
village
of
afchih
situated
one
stage
from
tihran
when
this
news
was
spread
abroad
and
punishment
began
everyone
who
was
able
hid
himself
in
some
retreat
or
fled
the
country
amongst
these
mirza
yahya
the
brother
of
bahaullah
concealed
himself
and
a
bewildered
fugitive
in
the
guise
of
a
dervish
with
kashkul
in
hand
wandered
in
mountains
and
plains
on
the
road
to
rasht
but
bahaullah
rode
forth
with
perfect
composure
and
calmness
from
afchih
and
came
to
niyavaran
which
was
the
abode
of
the
royal
train
and
the
station
of
the
imperial
camp
immediately
on
his
arrival
he
was
placed
under
arrest
and
a
whole
regiment
guarded
him
closely
after
several
days
of
interrogation
they
sent
him
in
chains
and
fetters
from
shimiran
to
the
jail
of
tihran
and
this
harshness
and
punishment
was
due
to
the
immoderate
importunity
of
haji
ali
khan
the
hajibuddawlih
nor
did
there
seem
any
hope
of
deliverance
until
his
majesty
the
king
moved
by
his
own
kindly
spirit
commanded
circumspection
and
ordered
this
occurrence
to
be
investigated
and
examined
particularly
and
generally
by
means
of
the
ministers
of
the
imperial
court
now
when
bahaullah
was
interrogated
on
this
matter
he
answered
in
reply
the
event
itself
indicates
the
truth
of
the
affair
and
testifies
that
this
is
the
action
of
a
thoughtless
unreasoning
and
ignorant
man
for
no
reasonable
person
would
charge
his
pistol
with
shot
when
embarking
on
so
grave
an
enterprise
at
least
he
would
so
arrange
and
plan
it
that
the
deed
should
be
orderly
and
systematic
from
the
very
nature
of
the
event
it
is
clear
and
evident
as
the
sun
that
it
is
not
the
act
of
such
as
myself
so
it
was
established
and
proven
that
the
assassin
had
on
his
own
responsibility
engaged
in
this
grievous
action
and
monstrous
deed
with
the
idea
and
design
of
taking
blood
revenge
for
his
master
and
that
it
concerned
no
one
else
and
when
the
truth
of
the
matter
became
evident
the
innocence
of
bahaullah
from
this
suspicion
was
established
in
such
wise
that
no
doubt
remained
for
anyone
the
decision
of
the
court
declared
his
purity
and
freedom
from
this
charge
and
it
became
apparent
and
clear
that
what
had
been
done
with
regard
to
him
was
due
to
the
efforts
of
his
foes
and
the
hasty
folly
of
the
hajibuddawlih
therefore
did
the
government
of
eternal
duration
desire
to
restore
certain
properties
and
estates
which
had
been
confiscated
that
thereby
it
might
pacify
him
but
since
the
chief
part
of
these
was
lost
and
only
an
inconsiderable
portion
was
forthcoming
none
came
forward
to
claim
them
indeed
bahaullah
requested
permission
to
withdraw
to
the
supreme
shrines
of
karbila
and
najaf
and
after
some
months
by
the
royal
permission
and
with
the
leave
of
the
prime
minister
set
out
accompanied
by
one
of
the
kings
messengers
for
the
shrines
let
us
return
however
to
our
original
subject
of
the
babs
writings
many
remained
in
mens
hands
some
of
these
were
commentaries
on
and
interpretations
of
the
verses
of
the
quran
some
were
prayers
homilies
and
hints
of
the
true
significance
of
certain
passages
others
were
exhortations
admonitions
dissertations
on
the
different
branches
of
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
unity
demonstrations
of
the
special
prophetic
mission
of
the
lord
of
existing
things
muhammad
and
as
it
hath
been
understood
encouragements
to
amendment
of
character
severance
from
worldly
states
and
dependence
on
the
inspirations
of
god
but
the
essence
and
purport
of
his
compositions
were
the
praises
and
descriptions
of
that
reality
soon
to
appear
which
was
his
only
object
and
aim
his
darling
and
his
desire
for
he
regarded
his
own
appearance
as
that
of
a
harbinger
of
good
tidings
and
considered
his
own
real
nature
merely
as
a
means
for
the
manifestation
of
the
greater
perfections
of
that
one
and
indeed
he
ceased
not
from
celebrating
him
by
night
or
day
for
a
single
instant
but
used
to
signify
to
all
his
followers
that
they
should
expect
his
arising
in
such
wise
that
he
declares
in
his
writings
i
am
a
letter
out
of
that
most
mighty
book
and
a
dewdrop
from
that
limitless
ocean
and
when
he
shall
appear
my
true
nature
my
mysteries
riddles
and
intimations
will
become
evident
and
the
embryo
of
this
religion
shall
develop
through
the
grades
of
its
being
and
ascent
attain
to
the
station
of
the
most
comely
of
forms
and
become
adorned
with
the
robe
of
blessed
be
god
the
best
of
creators
and
this
event
will
disclose
itself
in
the
year
ah
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixtynine
which
corresponds
to
the
number
of
the
year
of
after
a
while
and
thou
shalt
see
the
mountains
which
thou
thinkest
so
solid
passing
away
like
the
passing
of
the
clouds
shall
be
fulfilled
in
short
he
so
described
him
that
in
his
own
expression
he
regarded
approach
to
the
divine
bounty
and
attainment
of
the
highest
degrees
of
perfection
in
the
worlds
of
humanity
as
dependent
on
love
for
him
and
so
inflamed
was
he
with
his
flame
that
commemoration
of
him
was
the
bright
candle
of
his
dark
nights
in
the
fortress
of
maku
and
remembrance
of
him
was
the
best
of
companions
in
the
straits
of
the
prison
of
chihriq
thereby
he
obtained
spiritual
enlargements
with
his
wine
was
he
inebriated
and
at
remembrance
of
him
did
he
rejoice
all
of
his
followers
too
were
in
expectation
of
the
appearance
of
these
signs
and
each
one
of
his
intimates
was
seeking
after
the
fulfillment
of
these
forecasts
now
from
the
beginning
of
the
manifestation
of
the
bab
there
was
in
tihran
which
the
bab
called
the
holy
land
a
youth
of
the
family
of
one
of
the
ministers
and
of
noble
lineage
gifted
in
every
way
and
adorned
with
purity
and
nobility
although
he
combined
lofty
lineage
with
high
connection
and
although
his
ancestors
were
men
of
note
in
persia
and
universally
sought
after
yet
he
was
not
of
a
race
of
doctors
or
a
family
of
scholars
now
this
youth
was
from
his
earliest
adolescence
celebrated
amongst
those
of
the
ministerial
class
both
relatives
and
strangers
for
singlemindedness
and
was
from
childhood
pointed
out
as
remarkable
for
sagacity
and
held
in
regard
in
the
eyes
of
the
wise
he
did
not
however
after
the
fashion
of
his
ancestors
desire
elevation
to
lofty
ranks
nor
seek
advancement
to
splendid
but
transient
positions
his
extreme
aptitude
was
nevertheless
admitted
by
all
and
his
excessive
acuteness
and
intelligence
were
universally
avowed
in
the
eyes
of
the
common
folk
he
enjoyed
a
wonderful
esteem
and
in
all
gatherings
and
assemblies
he
had
a
marvelous
speech
and
delivery
notwithstanding
lack
of
instruction
and
education
such
was
the
keenness
of
his
penetration
and
the
readiness
of
his
apprehension
that
when
during
his
youthful
prime
he
appeared
in
assemblies
where
questions
of
divinity
and
points
of
metaphysic
were
being
discussed
and
in
presence
of
a
great
concourse
of
doctors
and
scholars
loosed
his
tongue
all
those
present
were
amazed
accounting
this
as
a
sort
of
prodigy
beyond
the
discernment
natural
to
the
human
race
from
his
early
years
he
was
the
hope
of
his
kindred
and
the
unique
one
of
his
family
and
race
nay
their
refuge
and
shelter
however
in
spite
of
these
conditions
and
circumstances
as
he
wore
a
kulah
on
his
head
and
locks
flowing
over
his
shoulder
no
one
imagined
that
he
would
become
the
source
of
such
matters
or
that
the
waves
of
his
flood
would
reach
the
zenith
of
this
firmament
when
the
question
of
the
bab
was
noised
abroad
signs
of
partiality
appeared
in
him
at
the
first
he
apprised
his
relatives
and
connections
and
the
children
and
dependents
of
his
own
circle
subsequently
he
occupied
his
energies
by
day
and
night
in
inviting
friends
and
strangers
to
embrace
the
new
faith
he
arose
with
mighty
resolution
engaged
with
the
utmost
constancy
in
systematizing
the
principles
and
consolidating
the
ethical
canons
of
that
society
in
every
way
and
strove
by
all
means
to
protect
and
guard
these
people
when
he
had
thus
established
the
foundations
in
tihran
he
hastened
to
mazindaran
where
he
displayed
in
assemblies
meetings
conferences
inns
mosques
and
colleges
a
mighty
power
of
utterance
and
exposition
whoever
beheld
his
open
brow
or
heard
his
vivid
eulogies
perceived
him
with
the
eye
of
actual
vision
to
be
a
patent
demonstration
a
latent
magnetic
force
and
a
pervading
influence
a
great
number
both
of
rich
and
poor
and
of
erudite
doctors
were
attracted
by
his
preaching
and
washed
their
hands
of
heart
and
life
being
so
enkindled
that
they
laid
down
their
lives
under
the
sword
dancing
with
joy
thus
amongst
many
instances
one
day
four
learned
and
accomplished
scholars
of
the
divines
of
nur
were
present
in
his
company
and
in
such
wise
did
he
expound
that
all
four
were
involuntarily
constrained
to
entreat
him
to
accept
them
for
his
service
for
by
dint
of
his
eloquence
which
was
like
evident
sorcery
he
satisfied
these
eminent
doctors
that
they
were
in
reality
children
engaged
in
the
rudiments
of
study
and
the
merest
tyros
and
that
therefore
they
must
read
the
alphabet
from
the
beginning
several
protracted
conferences
were
passed
in
expounding
and
elucidating
the
point
and
the
alif
of
the
absolute
wherein
the
doctors
present
were
astounded
and
filled
with
amazement
and
astonishment
at
the
seething
and
roaring
of
the
ocean
of
his
utterance
the
report
of
this
occurrence
reached
the
hearing
of
far
and
near
and
deep
despondency
fell
on
the
adversaries
the
regions
of
nur
were
filled
with
excitement
and
commotion
at
these
events
and
the
noise
of
this
mischief
and
trouble
smote
the
ears
of
the
citizens
of
barfurush
the
chief
divine
of
nur
mulla
muhammad
was
in
qishlaq
when
he
heard
of
these
occurrences
he
sent
two
of
the
most
distinguished
and
profound
of
the
doctors
who
were
possessed
of
wondrous
eloquence
effective
oratorical
talent
conclusiveness
of
argument
and
brilliant
powers
of
demonstration
to
quench
this
fire
and
to
subdue
and
overcome
this
young
man
by
force
of
argument
either
reducing
him
to
penitence
or
causing
him
to
despair
of
the
successful
issue
of
his
projects
glory
be
to
god
for
his
wondrous
decrees
when
those
two
doctors
entered
the
presence
of
that
young
man
saw
the
waves
of
his
utterance
and
heard
the
force
of
his
arguments
they
unfolded
like
the
rose
and
were
stirred
like
the
multitude
and
abandoning
altar
and
chair
pulpit
and
preferment
wealth
and
luxury
and
evening
and
morning
congregations
they
applied
themselves
to
the
furtherance
of
the
objects
of
this
person
even
inviting
the
chief
divine
to
tender
his
allegiance
so
when
this
young
man
with
a
faculty
of
speech
like
a
rushing
torrent
set
out
for
amul
and
sari
he
met
with
that
experienced
doctor
and
that
illustrious
divine
in
qishlaq
of
nur
and
the
people
assembled
from
all
quarters
awaiting
the
result
his
accomplished
reverence
the
divine
although
he
was
of
universally
acknowledged
excellence
and
in
science
the
most
learned
of
his
contemporaries
nevertheless
decided
to
have
recourse
to
augury
as
to
whether
he
should
engage
in
discussion
and
disputation
this
did
not
prove
favorable
and
he
therefore
excused
himself
deferring
the
discussion
until
some
other
time
his
incompetency
and
shortcoming
thereby
became
known
and
suspected
and
this
caused
the
adherence
confirmation
and
edification
of
many
in
brief
outline
the
narrative
is
this
for
some
while
he
wandered
about
in
those
districts
after
the
death
of
the
late
prince
muhammad
shah
he
returned
to
tihran
having
in
his
mind
the
intention
of
corresponding
and
entering
into
relations
with
the
bab
the
medium
of
this
correspondence
was
the
celebrated
mulla
abdulkarim
of
qazvin
who
was
the
babs
mainstay
and
trusted
intimate
now
since
a
great
celebrity
had
been
attained
for
bahaullah
in
tihran
and
the
hearts
of
men
were
disposed
towards
him
he
together
with
mulla
abdulkarim
considered
it
as
expedient
that
in
face
of
the
agitation
amongst
the
doctors
the
aggressiveness
of
the
greater
part
of
the
people
of
persia
and
the
irresistible
power
of
the
amirnizam
whereby
both
the
bab
and
bahaullah
were
in
great
danger
and
liable
to
incur
severe
punishment
some
measure
should
be
adopted
to
direct
the
thoughts
of
men
towards
some
absent
person
by
which
means
bahaullah
would
remain
protected
from
the
interference
of
all
men
and
since
further
having
regard
to
sundry
considerations
they
did
not
consider
an
outsider
as
suitable
they
cast
the
lot
of
this
augury
to
the
name
of
bahaullahs
brother
mirza
yahya
by
the
assistance
and
instruction
of
bahaullah
therefore
they
made
him
notorious
and
famous
on
the
tongues
of
friends
and
foes
and
wrote
letters
ostensibly
at
his
dictation
to
the
bab
and
since
secret
correspondences
were
in
process
the
bab
highly
approved
of
this
scheme
so
mirza
yahya
was
concealed
and
hidden
while
mention
of
him
was
on
the
tongues
and
in
the
mouths
of
men
and
this
mighty
plan
was
of
wondrous
efficacy
for
bahaullah
though
he
was
known
and
seen
remained
safe
and
secure
and
this
veil
was
the
cause
that
no
one
outside
the
sect
fathomed
the
matter
or
fell
into
the
idea
of
molestation
until
bahaullah
quitted
tihran
at
the
permission
of
the
king
and
was
permitted
to
withdraw
to
the
supreme
shrines
when
he
reached
baghdad
and
the
crescent
moon
of
the
month
of
muharram
of
the
year
ah
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixtynine
which
was
termed
in
the
books
of
the
bab
the
year
of
after
a
while
and
wherein
he
had
promised
the
disclosure
of
the
true
nature
of
his
religion
and
its
mysteries
shone
forth
from
the
horizon
of
the
world
this
covert
secret
as
is
related
became
apparent
amongst
all
within
and
without
the
society
bahaullah
with
mighty
steadfastness
became
a
target
for
the
arrows
of
all
amongst
mankind
while
mirza
yahya
in
disguise
passed
his
time
now
in
the
environs
and
vicinity
of
baghdad
engaged
for
better
concealment
in
various
trades
now
in
baghdad
itself
in
the
garb
of
the
arabs
now
bahaullah
so
acted
that
the
hearts
of
this
sect
were
drawn
towards
him
while
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
iraq
were
reduced
to
silence
and
speechlessness
some
being
amazed
and
others
angered
after
remaining
there
for
one
year
he
withdrew
his
hand
from
all
things
abandoned
relatives
and
connections
and
without
the
knowledge
of
his
followers
quitted
iraq
alone
and
solitary
without
companion
supporter
associate
or
comrade
for
nigh
upon
two
years
he
dwelt
in
turkish
kurdistan
generally
in
a
place
named
sargalu
situated
in
the
mountains
and
far
removed
from
human
habitations
sometimes
on
rare
occasions
he
used
to
frequent
sulaymaniyyih
ere
long
had
elapsed
the
most
eminent
doctors
of
those
regions
got
some
inkling
of
his
circumstances
and
conditions
and
conversed
with
him
on
the
solution
of
certain
difficult
questions
connected
with
the
most
abstruse
points
of
theology
having
witnessed
on
his
part
ample
signs
and
satisfactory
explanations
they
observed
towards
him
the
utmost
respectfulness
and
deference
in
consequence
of
this
he
acquired
a
great
fame
and
wonderful
reputation
in
those
regions
and
fragmentary
accounts
of
him
were
circulated
in
all
quarters
and
directions
to
wit
that
a
stranger
a
persian
had
appeared
in
the
district
of
sulaymaniyyih
which
hath
been
from
of
old
the
place
whence
the
most
expert
doctors
of
the
sunnites
have
arisen
and
that
the
people
of
that
country
had
loosed
their
tongues
in
praise
of
him
from
the
rumor
thus
heard
it
was
known
that
that
person
was
none
other
than
bahaullah
several
persons
therefore
hastened
thither
and
began
to
entreat
and
implore
and
the
urgent
entreaty
of
all
brought
about
his
return
now
although
this
sect
had
not
been
affected
with
quaking
or
consternation
at
these
grievous
events
such
as
the
slaughter
of
their
chief
and
the
rest
but
did
rather
increase
and
multiply
still
since
the
bab
was
but
beginning
to
lay
the
foundations
when
he
was
slain
therefore
was
this
community
ignorant
concerning
its
proper
conduct
action
behavior
and
duty
their
sole
guiding
principle
being
love
for
the
bab
this
ignorance
was
the
reason
that
in
some
parts
disturbances
occurred
for
experiencing
violent
molestation
they
unclosed
their
hands
in
selfdefense
but
after
his
return
bahaullah
made
such
strenuous
efforts
in
educating
teaching
training
regulating
and
reconstructing
this
community
that
in
a
short
while
all
these
troubles
and
mischiefs
were
quenched
and
the
utmost
tranquility
and
repose
reigned
in
mens
hearts
so
that
according
to
what
hath
been
heard
it
became
clear
and
obvious
even
to
statesmen
that
the
fundamental
intentions
and
ideas
of
this
sect
were
things
spiritual
and
such
as
are
connected
with
pure
hearts
that
their
true
and
essential
principles
were
to
reform
the
morals
and
beautify
the
conduct
of
the
human
race
and
that
with
things
material
they
had
absolutely
no
concern
when
these
principles
then
were
established
in
the
hearts
of
this
sect
they
so
acted
in
all
lands
that
they
became
celebrated
amongst
statesmen
for
gentleness
of
spirit
steadfastness
of
heart
right
intent
good
deeds
and
excellence
of
conduct
for
this
people
are
most
welldisposed
towards
obedience
and
submissiveness
and
on
receiving
such
instruction
they
conformed
their
conduct
and
behavior
thereto
formerly
exception
was
taken
to
the
words
deeds
demeanor
morals
and
conduct
of
this
sect
now
objection
is
made
in
persia
to
their
tenets
and
spiritual
state
now
this
is
beyond
the
power
of
man
that
he
should
be
able
by
interference
or
objection
to
change
the
heart
and
conscience
or
meddle
with
the
convictions
of
anyone
for
in
the
realm
of
conscience
naught
but
the
ray
of
gods
light
can
command
and
on
the
throne
of
the
heart
none
but
the
pervading
power
of
the
king
of
kings
should
rule
thus
it
is
that
one
can
arrest
and
suspend
the
action
of
every
faculty
except
thought
and
reflection
for
a
man
cannot
even
by
his
own
volition
withhold
himself
from
reflection
or
thought
nor
keep
back
his
musings
and
imaginings
at
all
events
the
undeniable
truth
is
this
that
for
nigh
upon
thirtyfive
years
no
action
opposed
to
the
government
or
prejudicial
to
the
nation
has
emanated
from
this
sect
or
been
witnessed
on
their
part
and
that
during
this
long
period
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
their
numbers
and
strength
are
double
what
they
were
formerly
no
sound
has
arisen
from
any
place
except
that
every
now
and
then
learned
doctors
and
eminent
scholars
really
for
the
extension
of
this
report
through
the
world
and
the
awakening
of
men
sentence
some
few
to
death
for
such
interference
is
not
destruction
but
edification
when
thou
regardest
the
truth
which
will
not
thereby
become
quenched
and
forgotten
but
rather
stimulated
and
advertised
i
will
at
least
relate
one
short
anecdote
of
what
actually
took
place
a
certain
person
violently
molested
and
grievously
injured
a
certain
babi
the
victim
unclosed
his
hand
in
retaliation
and
arose
to
take
vengeance
unsheathing
his
weapon
against
the
aggressor
becoming
the
object
of
censure
and
reprimand
of
this
sect
however
he
took
refuge
in
flight
pages
when
he
reached
hamadan
his
character
became
known
and
as
he
was
of
the
clerical
class
the
doctors
vehemently
pursued
him
handed
him
over
to
the
government
and
ordered
chastisement
to
be
inflicted
by
chance
there
fell
out
from
the
fold
of
his
collar
a
document
written
by
bahaullah
the
subject
of
which
was
reproof
of
attempts
at
retaliation
censure
and
reprobation
of
the
search
after
vengeance
and
prohibition
from
following
after
lusts
amongst
other
matters
they
found
these
expressions
contained
in
it
verily
god
is
quit
of
the
seditious
and
likewise
if
ye
be
slain
it
is
better
for
you
than
that
ye
should
slay
and
when
ye
are
tormented
have
recourse
to
the
controllers
of
affairs
and
the
refuge
of
the
people
and
if
ye
be
neglected
then
entrust
your
affairs
to
the
jealous
lord
this
is
the
mark
of
the
sincere
and
the
characteristic
of
the
assured
when
the
governor
became
cognizant
of
this
writing
he
addressed
that
person
saying
by
the
decree
of
that
chief
whom
you
yourself
obey
correction
is
necessary
and
punishment
and
chastisement
obligatory
if
replied
that
person
you
will
carry
out
all
his
precepts
i
shall
have
the
utmost
pleasure
in
submitting
to
punishment
and
death
the
governor
smiled
and
let
the
man
go
so
bahaullah
made
the
utmost
efforts
to
educate
his
people
and
incite
them
to
morality
the
acquisition
of
the
sciences
and
arts
of
all
countries
kindly
dealing
with
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
desire
for
the
welfare
of
all
peoples
sociability
concord
obedience
submissiveness
instruction
of
their
children
production
of
what
is
needful
for
the
human
race
and
inauguration
of
true
happiness
for
mankind
and
he
continually
kept
sending
tracts
of
admonition
to
all
parts
whereby
a
wonderful
effect
was
produced
some
of
these
epistles
have
after
extreme
search
and
inquiry
been
examined
and
some
portions
of
them
shall
now
be
set
down
in
writing
all
these
epistles
consisted
of
exhortations
to
purity
of
morals
encouragement
to
good
conduct
reprobation
of
certain
individuals
and
complaints
of
the
seditious
amongst
others
this
sentence
was
recorded
my
captivity
is
not
my
abasement
by
my
life
it
is
indeed
a
glory
unto
me
but
the
abasement
is
the
action
of
my
friends
who
connect
themselves
with
us
and
follow
the
devil
in
their
actions
amongst
them
is
he
who
taketh
lust
and
turneth
aside
from
what
is
commanded
and
amongst
them
is
he
who
followeth
the
truth
in
right
guidance
as
for
those
who
commit
sin
and
cling
to
the
world
they
are
assuredly
not
of
the
people
of
baha
so
again
well
it
is
with
him
who
is
adorned
with
the
decoration
of
manners
and
morals
verily
he
is
of
those
who
help
their
lord
with
clear
perspicuous
action
he
is
god
exalted
is
his
state
wisdom
and
utterance
the
true
one
glorious
is
his
glory
for
the
showing
forth
of
the
gems
of
ideals
from
the
mine
of
man
hath
in
every
age
sent
a
trusted
one
the
primary
foundation
of
the
faith
of
god
and
the
religion
of
god
is
this
that
they
should
not
make
diverse
sects
and
various
paths
the
cause
and
reason
of
hatred
these
principles
and
laws
and
firm
sure
roads
appear
from
one
dawningplace
and
shine
from
one
dayspring
and
these
diversities
were
out
of
regard
for
the
requirements
of
the
time
season
ages
and
epochs
o
unitarians
make
firm
the
girdle
of
endeavor
that
perchance
religious
strife
and
conflict
may
be
removed
from
amongst
the
people
of
the
world
and
be
annulled
for
love
of
god
and
his
servants
engage
in
this
great
and
mighty
matter
religious
hatred
and
rancor
is
a
worldconsuming
fire
and
the
quenching
thereof
most
arduous
unless
the
hand
of
divine
might
give
men
deliverance
from
this
unfruitful
calamity
consider
a
war
which
happeneth
between
two
states
both
sides
have
foregone
wealth
and
life
how
many
villages
were
beheld
as
though
they
were
not
this
precept
is
in
the
position
of
the
light
in
the
lamp
of
utterance
o
people
of
the
world
ye
are
all
the
fruit
of
one
tree
and
the
leaves
of
one
branch
walk
with
perfect
charity
concord
affection
and
agreement
i
swear
by
the
sun
of
truth
the
light
of
agreement
shall
brighten
and
illumine
the
horizons
the
allknowing
truth
hath
been
and
is
the
witness
to
this
saying
endeavor
to
attain
to
this
high
supreme
station
which
is
the
station
of
protection
and
preservation
of
mankind
this
is
the
intent
of
the
king
of
intentions
and
this
the
hope
of
the
lord
of
hopes
we
trust
that
god
will
assist
the
kings
of
the
earth
to
illuminate
and
adorn
the
earth
with
the
refulgent
light
of
the
sun
of
justice
at
one
time
we
spoke
in
the
language
of
the
law
at
another
time
in
the
language
of
the
truth
and
the
way
and
the
ultimate
object
and
remote
aim
was
the
showing
forth
of
this
high
supreme
station
and
god
sufficeth
for
witness
o
friends
consort
with
all
the
people
of
the
world
with
joy
and
fragrance
if
there
be
to
you
a
word
or
essence
whereof
others
than
you
are
devoid
communicate
it
and
show
it
forth
in
the
language
of
affection
and
kindness
if
it
be
received
and
be
effective
the
object
is
attained
and
if
not
leave
it
to
him
and
with
regard
to
him
deal
not
harshly
but
pray
the
language
of
kindness
is
the
lodestone
of
hearts
and
the
food
of
the
soul
it
stands
in
the
relation
of
ideas
to
words
and
is
as
an
horizon
for
the
shining
of
the
sun
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
if
the
unitarians
had
in
the
latter
times
acted
according
to
the
glorious
law
which
came
after
his
highness
the
seal
of
the
prophets
may
the
life
of
all
beside
him
be
his
sacrifice
and
had
clung
to
its
skirt
the
foundation
of
the
fortress
of
religion
would
not
have
been
shaken
and
populous
cities
would
not
have
been
ruined
but
rather
cities
and
villages
would
have
acquired
and
been
adorned
with
the
decoration
of
peace
and
serenity
through
the
heedlessness
and
discordance
of
the
favored
people
and
the
smoke
of
wicked
souls
the
fair
nation
is
seen
to
be
darkened
and
enfeebled
had
they
acted
according
to
what
they
knew
they
would
not
have
been
heedless
of
the
light
of
the
sun
of
justice
this
victim
hath
from
earliest
days
until
now
been
afflicted
at
the
hands
of
the
heedless
they
exiled
us
without
cause
at
one
time
to
iraq
at
another
time
to
adrianople
and
thence
to
akka
which
was
a
place
of
exile
for
murderers
and
robbers
neither
is
it
known
where
and
in
what
spot
we
shall
take
up
our
abode
after
this
greatest
prisonhouse
knowledge
is
with
god
the
lord
of
the
throne
and
of
the
dust
and
the
lord
of
the
lofty
seat
in
whatever
place
we
may
be
and
whatever
befall
us
the
saints
must
gaze
with
perfect
steadfastness
and
confidence
towards
the
supreme
horizon
and
occupy
themselves
in
the
reformation
of
the
world
and
the
education
of
the
nations
what
hath
befallen
and
shall
befall
hath
been
and
is
an
instrument
and
means
for
the
furtherance
of
the
word
of
unity
take
hold
of
the
command
of
god
and
cling
thereto
verily
it
hath
been
sent
down
from
beside
a
wise
ordainer
with
perfect
compassion
and
mercy
have
we
guided
and
directed
the
people
of
the
world
to
that
whereby
their
souls
shall
be
profited
i
swear
by
the
sun
of
truth
which
hath
shone
forth
from
the
highest
horizons
of
the
world
that
the
people
of
baha
had
not
and
have
not
any
aim
save
the
prosperity
and
reformation
of
the
world
and
the
purifying
of
the
nations
with
all
men
they
have
been
in
sincerity
and
charity
their
outward
appearance
is
one
with
their
inward
heart
and
their
inward
heart
identical
with
their
outward
appearance
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
not
hidden
or
concealed
but
plain
and
evident
before
mens
faces
their
very
deeds
are
the
witness
of
this
assertion
today
let
everyone
endowed
with
vision
win
his
way
from
deeds
and
signs
to
the
object
of
the
people
of
baha
and
from
their
speech
and
conduct
gain
knowledge
of
their
intent
the
waves
of
the
ocean
of
divine
mercy
appear
at
the
utmost
height
and
the
showers
of
the
clouds
of
his
grace
and
favor
descend
every
moment
during
the
days
of
sojourn
in
iraq
this
oppressed
one
sat
down
and
consorted
with
all
classes
without
veil
or
disguise
how
many
of
the
denizens
of
the
horizons
entered
in
enmity
and
went
forth
in
sympathy
the
door
of
grace
was
open
before
the
faces
of
all
with
rebellious
and
obedient
did
we
outwardly
converse
after
one
fashion
that
perchance
the
evildoers
might
win
their
way
to
the
ocean
of
boundless
forgiveness
the
splendors
of
the
name
of
the
concealer
were
in
such
wise
manifested
that
the
evildoer
imagined
that
he
was
accounted
of
the
good
no
messenger
was
disappointed
and
no
inquirer
was
turned
back
the
causes
of
the
aversion
and
avoidance
of
men
were
certain
of
the
doctors
of
persia
and
the
unseemly
deeds
of
the
ignorant
by
the
term
doctors
in
these
passages
are
signified
those
persons
who
have
withheld
mankind
from
the
shore
of
the
ocean
of
unity
but
as
for
the
learned
who
practice
their
knowledge
and
the
wise
who
act
justly
they
are
as
the
spirit
unto
the
body
of
the
world
well
is
it
with
that
learned
man
whose
head
is
adorned
with
the
crown
of
justice
and
whose
body
glorieth
in
the
ornament
of
honesty
the
pen
of
admonition
exhorteth
the
friends
and
enjoineth
on
them
charity
pity
wisdom
and
gentleness
the
oppressed
one
is
this
day
a
prisoner
his
allies
are
the
hosts
of
good
deeds
and
virtues
not
ranks
and
hosts
and
guns

one
holy
action
maketh
the
world

o

help
the
oppressed
one
with
wellpleasing
virtues
and
good
deeds
today
let
every
soul
desire
to
attain
the
highest
station
he
must
not
regard
what
is
in
him
but
what
is
in
god
it
is
not
for
him
to
regard
what
shall
advantage
himself
but
that
whereby
the
word
of
god
which
must
be
obeyed
shall
be
upraised
the
heart
must
be
sanctified
from
every
form
of

which
guardeth

unceasingly
hath
the

verily
the

enjoineth
on
you
the
greatest

its

more
evident
than
the
light
of
the
sun
in
its
light
and
its
brightness
and
its

every
light
is
eclipsed
we
desire
of

that
he
will
not
withhold
from
his
cities
and
lands
the
radiant
effulgence
of
the
sun
of
faithfulness
we
have
directed
all
in
the
nights
and
in
the
days
to
faithfulness
chastity
purity
and
constancy
and
have
enjoined
good
deeds
and
wellpleasing
qualities
in
the
nights
and
in
the
days
the
shriek
of
the
pen
ariseth
and
the
tongue
speaketh
that
against
the
sword
the
word
may
arise
and
against
fierceness
patience

in

of
oppression
submission
and
at
the
time
of
martyrdom
resignation
for
thirty
years
and
more
in
all
that
hath
befallen
this
oppressed
community
they
have
been
patient
referring
it
to
god
everyone
endowed
with
justice
and
fairness
hath
testified
and
doth
testify
to
that
which
hath
been
said
during
this
period
this
oppressed
one
was
engaged
in
good
exhortations
and
efficacious
and
sufficient
admonitions
till
it
became
established
and
obvious
before
all
that
this
victim
had
made
himself
a
target
for
the
arrows
of
calamity
unto
the
showing
forth
of
the
treasures
deposited
in
mens
souls
strife
and
contest
were
and
are
seemly
in
the
beasts
of
prey
of
the
earth
but
laudable
actions
are
seemly
in
man
blessed
is
the
merciful
one
who
created
man
and
taught
him
utterance
after
all
these
troubles
neither
are
the
ministers
of
state
content
nor
the
doctors
of
the
church
not
one
soul
was
found
to
utter
a
word
for
god
before
the
court
of
his
majesty
the
king
may
god
perpetuate
his
kingdom
there
shall
not
befall
us
aught
save
that
which
god
hath
decreed
unto
us
they
acted
not
kindly
nor
was
there
any
shortcoming
in
the
display
of
evil
justice
became
like
the
phoenix
and
faithfulness
like
the
philosophers
stone
none
spake
for
the
right
it
would
seem
that
justice
had
become
hateful
to
men
and
cast
forth
from
all
lands
like
the
people
of
god
glory
be
to
god
in
the
episode
of
the
land
of
ta
not
one
spoke
for
that
which
god
had
commanded
having
regard
to
the
display
of
power
and
parade
of
service
in
the
presence
of
the
king
may
god
perpetuate
his
kingdom
they
have
called
good
evil
and
the
reformer
a
seditionmonger
the
like
of
these
persons
would
depict
the
drop
as
an
ocean
and
the
mote
as
a
sun
they
call
the
house
at
kulayn
the
strong
fortress
and
close
their
eyes
to
the
perspicuous
truth
they
have
attacked
a
number
of
reformers
of
the
world
with
the
charge
of
seditiousness
as
god
liveth
these
persons
had
and
have
no
intent
nor
hope
save
the
glory
of
the
state
and
service
to
their
nation
for
god
they
spoke
and
for
god
they
speak
and
in
the
way
of
god
do
they
journey
o
friends
ask
of
him
who
is
the
desire
of
the
denizens
of
earth
that
he
will
succor
his
majesty
the
king
may
god
perpetuate
his
kingdom
so
that
all
the
dominions
of
persia
may
by
the
light
of
the
sun
of
justice
become
adorned
with
the
decoration
of
tranquility
and
security
according
to
statements
made
he
at
the
promptings
of
his
blessed
nature
loosed
those
who
were
in
bonds
and
bestowed
freedom
on
the
captives
the
representation
of
certain
matters
before
the
faces
of
gods
servants
is
obligatory
and
natural
to
the
pious
so
that
the
good
may
be
aware
and
become
cognizant
thereof
verily
he
inspireth
whom
he
pleaseth
with
what
he
desireth
and
he
is
the
powerful
the
ordainer
the
knowing
the
wise
a
word
from
that
land
hath
reached
the
oppressed
one
which
in
truth
was
the
cause
of
wonder
his
highness
the
mutamiduddawlih
farhad
mirza
said
concerning
the
imprisoned
one
that
whereof
the
repetition
is
not
pleasing
this
victim
consorted
very
little
with
him
or
the
like
of
him
so
far
as
is
recollected
on
only
two
occasions
did
he
visit
murghmahallih
in
shimiran
where
was
the
abode
of
the
oppressed
one
on
the
first
occasion
he
came
one
day
in
the
afternoon
and
on
the
second
one
friday
morning
returning
nigh
unto
sundown
he
knows
and
is
conscious
that
he
should
not
speak
contrary
to
the
truth
if
one
enter
his
presence
let
him
repeat
these
words
before
him
on
behalf
of
the
oppressed
one
o
prince
i
ask
justice
and
fairness
from
your
highness
concerning
that
which
hath
befallen
this
poor
victim
well
is
it
for
that
soul
whom
the
doubts
of
the
perverse
withhold
not
from
the
display
of
justice
and
deprive
not
of
the
lights
of
the
luminary
of
equity
o
saints
of
god
at
the
end
of
our
discourse
we
enjoin
on
you
once
again
chastity
faithfulness
godliness
sincerity
and
purity
lay
aside
the
evil
and
adopt
the
good
this
is
that
whereunto
ye
are
commanded
in
the
book
of
god
the
knowing
the
wise
well
is
it
with
those
who
practice
this
injunction
at
this
moment
the
pen
crieth
out
saying
o
saints
of
god
regard
the
horizon
of
uprightness
and
be
quit
severed
and
free
from
what
is
beside
this
there
is
no
strength
and
no
power
save
in
god
in
short
formerly
in
all
provinces
in
persia
accounts
and
stories
concerning
this
sect
diverse
and
discordant
yea
incompatible
with
the
character
of
the
human
race
and
opposed
to
the
divine
endowment
passed
on
the
tongues
and
in
the
mouths
of
men
and
obtained
notoriety
but
when
their
principles
acquired
fixity
and
stability
and
their
conduct
and
behavior
were
known
and
appreciated
the
veil
of
doubt
and
suspicion
fell
the
true
character
of
this
sect
became
clear
and
evident
and
it
reached
the
degree
of
certainty
that
their
principles
were
unlike
mens
fancies
and
that
their
foundation
differed
from
the
popular
opinion
and
estimate
in
their
conduct
action
morality
and
demeanor
was
no
place
for
objection
the
objection
in
persia
is
to
certain
of
the
ideas
and
tenets
of
this
sect
and
from
the
indications
of
various
circumstances
it
hath
been
observed
that
the
people
have
acquired
belief
and
confidence
in
the
trustworthiness
faithfulness
and
godliness
of
this
sect
in
all
transactions
let
us
return
to
our
original
topic
during
the
period
of
their
sojourn
in
iraq
these
persons
became
notorious
throughout
the
world
for
exile
resulted
in
fame
in
such
wise
that
a
great
number
of
other
parties
sought
alliance
and
union
and
devised
means
of
acquiring
intimacy
with
them
but
the
chief
of
this
sect
discovering
the
aims
of
each
faction
acted
with
the
utmost
consistency
circumspection
and
firmness
reposing
confidence
in
none
he
applied
himself
as
far
as
possible
to
the
admonition
of
each
inciting
and
urging
them
to
good
resolutions
and
aims
beneficial
to
the
state
and
the
nation
and
this
conduct
and
behavior
of
the
chief
acquired
notoriety
in
iraq
so
likewise
during
the
period
of
their
sojourn
in
iraq
certain
functionaries
of
foreign
governments
were
desirous
of
intimacy
and
sought
friendly
relations
with
them
but
the
chief
would
not
agree
amongst
other
strange
haps
was
this
that
in
iraq
certain
of
the
royal
family
came
to
an
understanding
with
these
foreign
governments
and
induced
by
promises
and
threats
conspired
with
them
but
this
sect
unloosed
their
tongues
in
reproach
and
began
to
admonish
them
saying
what
meanness
is
this
and
what
evident
treason
that
man
should
for
worldly
advantages
personal
profit
easy
circumstances
or
protection
of
life
and
property
cast
himself
into
this
great
detriment
and
evident
loss
and
embark
in
a
course
of
action
which
will
conduce
to
the
greatest
abasement
and
involve
the
utmost
infamy
and
disgrace
both
here
and
hereafter
one
can
support
any
baseness
save
treason
to
ones
country
and
every
sin
admits
of
pardon
and
forgiveness
save
that
of
dishonoring
ones
government
and
injuring
ones
nation
and
they
imagined
that
they
were
acting
patriotically
displaying
sincerity
and
loyalty
and
accounting
sacred
the
duties
of
fidelity
which
noble
aim
they
regarded
as
a
moral
obligation
so
rumors
of
this
were
spread
abroad
through
iraqiarab
and
such
as
wished
well
to
their
country
loosed
their
tongues
in
uttering
thanks
expressing
approval
and
respect
and
it
was
supposed
that
these
events
would
be
represented
in
the
royal
presence
but
after
a
while
it
became
known
that
certain
of
the
shaykhs
at
the
supreme
shrines
who
were
in
correspondence
with
the
court
yea
even
with
the
king
were
in
secret
continually
attributing
to
this
sect
strange
affinities
and
relations
imagining
that
such
attempts
would
conduce
to
favor
at
the
court
and
cause
advancement
of
their
condition
and
rank
and
since
no
one
could
speak
freely
on
this
matter
at
that
court
which
is
the
pivot
of
justice
whilst
just
ministers
aware
of
the
true
state
of
the
case
also
regarded
silence
as
their
best
policy
the
iraq
question
through
these
misrepresentations
and
rumors
assumed
gravity
in
tihran
and
was
enormously
exaggerated
but
the
consulsgeneral
being
cognizant
of
the
truth
continued
to
act
with
moderation
until
mirza
buzurg
khan
of
qazvin
became
consulgeneral
in
baghdad
now
since
this
person
was
wont
to
pass
the
greater
portion
of
his
time
in
a
state
of
intoxication
and
was
devoid
of
foresight
he
became
the
accomplice
and
confederate
of
those
shaykhs
in
iraq
and
girded
up
his
loins
stoutly
to
destroy
and
demolish
such
power
of
description
and
strength
of
fingers
as
he
possessed
he
employed
in
making
representations
and
statements
each
day
he
secretly
wrote
a
dispatch
to
tihran
made
vows
and
compacts
with
the
shaykhs
and
sent
diplomatic
notes
to
his
excellency
the
ambassadorinchief
at
constantinople
but
since
these
statements
and
depositions
had
no
basis
or
foundation
they
were
all
postponed
and
adjourned
until
at
length
these
shaykhs
convened
a
meeting
to
consult
with
the
consul
general
assembled
a
number
of
learned
doctors
and
great
divines
in
the
mosque
of
the
two
kazims
upon
them
be
peace
and
having
come
to
an
unanimous
agreement
wrote
to
the
divines
of
karbila
the
exalted
and
najaf
the
most
noble
convoking
them
all
they
came
some
knowing
others
not
knowing
amongst
the
latter
the
illustrious
and
expert
doctor
the
noble
and
celebrated
scholar

of
seekers
after

shaykh
murtada
now
departed
and
assoiled
who
was
the
admitted
chief
of
all
arrived
without
knowledge
of
the
matter
in
hand
but
so
soon
as
he
was
informed
of
their
actual
designs
he
said
i
am
not
properly
acquainted
with
the
essential
character
of
this
sect
nor
with
the
secret
tenets
and
hidden
theological
doctrines
of
this
community
neither
have
i
hitherto
witnessed
or
perceived
in
their
demeanor
or
conduct
anything
at
variance
with
the
perspicuous
book
which
would
lead
me
to
pronounce
them
infidels
therefore
hold
me
excused
in
this
matter
and
let
him
who
regards
it
as
his
duty
take
action
now
the
design
of
the
shaykhs
and
the
consul
was
a
sudden
and
general
attack
but
by
reason
of
the
noncompliance
of
the
departed
shaykh
this
scheme
proved
abortive
resulting
indeed
only
in
shame
and
disappointment
so
that
concourse
of
shaykhs
doctors
and
common
folk
which
had
come
from
karbila
dispersed
just
at
this
time
mischievous
personsincluding
even
certain
dismissed
ministersendeavored
on
all
sides
so
to
influence
this
sect
that
they
might
perchance
alter
their
course
and
conduct
from
every
quarter
lying
messages
and
disquieting
reports
continually
followed
one
another
in
uninterrupted
and
constant
succession
to
the
effect
that
the
deliberate
intention
of
the
court
of
persia
was
the
eradication
suppression
annihilation
and
destruction
of
this
sect
that
correspondence
was
continually
being
carried
on
with
the
local
authorities
and
that
all
the
babis
in
iraq
would
shortly
be
delivered
over
with
bound
hands
to
persia
but
the
babis
passed
the
time
in
calmness
and
silence
without
in
any
way
altering
their
behavior
and
conduct
so
when
mirza
buzurg
khan
failed
to
effect
and
accomplish
the
designs
of
his
heart
by
such
actions
also
he
illadvisedly
fell
to
reflecting
how
he
might
grieve
and
humiliate
the
babis
every
day
he
sought
some
pretext
for
offering
insult
aroused
some
disturbance
and
tumult
and
raised
up
the
banner
of
mischief
until
the
matter
came
nigh
to
culminating
in
the
sudden
outbreak
of
a
riot
the
lapse
of
the
reins
of
control
from
the
hand
and
the
precipitation
of
mens
hearts
into
disquietude
and
perturbation
and
their
minds
into
anguish
and
agony
now
when
the
babis
found
themselves
unable
to
treat
this
humor
by
any
means
for
strive
as
they
would
they
were
foiled
and
frustrated
and
when
they
failed
to
find
any
remedy
for
this
disorder
or
any
fairness
in
this
flower
they
deliberated
and
hesitated
for
nine
months
and
at
length
a
certain
number
of
them
to
stop
further
mischief
enrolled
themselves
as
subjects
of
the
sublime
ottoman
government
that
thereby
they
might
assuage
this
tumult
by
means
of
this
device
the
mischief
was
allayed
and
the
consul
withdrew
his
hand
from
molesting
them
but
he
notified
this
occurrence
to
the
royal
court
in
a
manner
at
variance
with
the
facts
and
contrary
to
the
truth
and
together
with
the
confederate
shaykhs
applied
himself
in
every
way
to
devices
for
distracting
the
senses
of
the
babis
finally
however
being
dismissed
and
overwhelmed
with
disaster
he
became
penitent
and
sorry
let
us
proceed
with
our
original
topic
for
eleven
years
and
somewhat
over
bahaullah
abode
in
iraqiarab
the
behavior
and
conduct
of
the
sect
were
such
that
his
fame
and
renown
increased
for
he
was
manifest
and
apparent
amongst
men
consorted
and
associated
with
all
parties
and
would
converse
familiarly
with
doctors
and
scholars
concerning
the
solution
of
difficult
theological
questions
and
the
verification
of
the
true
sense
of
abstruse
points
of
divinity
as
is
currently
reported
by
persons
of
every
class
he
used
to
please
all
whether
inhabitants
or
visitors
by
his
kindly
intercourse
and
courteous
address
and
this
sort
of
demeanor
and
conduct
on
his
part
led
them
to
suspect
sorcery
and
account
him
an
adept
in
the
occult
sciences
during
this
period
mirza
yahya
remained
concealed
and
hidden
continuing
and
abiding
in
his
former
conduct
and
behavior
until
when
the
edict
for
the
removal
of
bahaullah
from
baghdad
was
issued
by
his
majesty
the
ottoman
monarch
mirza
yahya
would
neither
quit
nor
accompany
him
at
one
time
he
meditated
setting
out
for
india
at
another
settling
in
turkistan
but
being
unable
to
decide
on
either
of
these
two
plans
he
finally
at
his
own
wish
set
out
before
all
in
the
garb
of
a
dervish
in
disguise
and
change
of
raiment
for
karkuk
and
arbil
thence
by
continuous
advance
he
reached
mosul
where
on
the
arrival
of
the
main
body
he
took
up
his
abode
and
station
alongside
their
caravan
and
although
throughout
this
journey
the
governors
and
officials
observed
the
utmost
consideration
and
respectfulness
while
march
and
halt
were
alike
dignified
and
honorable
nevertheless
was
he
always
concealed
in
change
of
raiment
and
acted
cautiously
on
the
idea
that
some
act
of
aggression
was
likely
to
occur
in
this
fashion
did
they
reach
constantinople
where
they
were
appointed
quarters
in
a
guesthouse
on
the
part
of
the
glorious
ottoman
monarchy
and
at
first
the
utmost
attention
was
paid
to
them
in
every
way
on
the
third
day
because
of
the
straitness
of
their
quarters
and
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
they
migrated
and
moved
to
another
house
certain
of
the
nobles
came
to
see
and
converse
with
them
and
these
as
is
related
behaved
with
moderation
notwithstanding
that
many
in
their
assemblies
and
gatherings
continued
to
condemn
and
vilify
them
saying
this
sect
are
a
mischief
to
all
the
world
and
destructive
of
treaties
and
covenants
they
are
a
source
of
trouble
and
baleful
to
all
lands
they
have
kindled
a
fire
and
consumed
the
earth
and
though
they
be
outwardly
fairseeming
yet
are
they
deserving
of
every
chastisement
and
punishment
yet
still
the
babis
continued
to
conduct
themselves
with
patience
calmness
deliberation
and
constancy
so
that
they
did
not
even
in
selfdefense
importune
the
occupants
of
high
places
or
frequent
the
houses
of
any
of
the
magnates
of
that
kingdom
whomsoever
amongst
the
great
he
baha
interviewed
on
his
own
account
they
met
and
no
word
save
of
sciences
and
arts
passed
between
them
until
certain
noblemen
sought
to
guide
him
and
loosed
their
tongues
in
friendly
counsel
saying
to
appeal
to
state
your
case
and
to
demand
justice
is
a
measure
demanded
by
custom
he
replied
in
answer
pursuing
the
path
of
obedience
to
the
kings
command
we
have
come
to
this
country
beyond
this
we
neither
had
nor
have
any
aim
or
desire
that
we
should
appeal
and
cause
trouble
what
is
now
hidden
behind
the
veil
of
destiny
will
in
the
future
become
manifest
there
neither
has
been
nor
is
any
necessity
for
supplication
and
importunity
if
the
enlightenedminded
leaders
of
your
nation
be
wise
and
diligent
they
will
certainly
make
inquiry
and
acquaint
themselves
with
the
true
state
of
the
case
if
not
then
their
attainment
of
the
truth
is
impracticable
and
impossible
under
these
circumstances
what
need
is
there
for
importuning
statesmen
and
supplicating
ministers
of
the
court
we
are
free
from
every
anxiety
and
ready
and
prepared
for
the
things
predestined
to
us
say
all
is
from
god
is
a
sound
and
sufficient
argument
and
if
god
toucheth
thee
with
a
hurt
there
is
no
dispeller
thereof
save
him
is
a
healing
medicine
after
some
months
a
royal
edict
was
promulgated
appointing
adrianople
in
the
district
of
roumelia
as
their
place
of
abode
and
residence
to
that
city
the
babis
accompanied
by
turkish
officers
proceeded
all
together
and
there
they
made
their
home
and
habitation
according
to
statements
heard
from
sundry
travelers
and
from
certain
great
and
learned
men
of
that
city
they
behaved
and
conducted
themselves
there
also
in
such
wise
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
and
the
government
officials
used
to
eulogize
them
and
all
used
to
show
them
respect
and
deference
in
short
since
bahaullah
was
wont
to
hold
intercourse
with
the
doctors
scholars
magnates
and
nobles
thereby
obtaining
fame
and
celebrity
throughout
roumelia
the
materials
of
comfort
were
gathered
together
neither
fear
nor
dread
remained
they
reposed
on
the
couch
of
ease
and
passed
their
time
in
quietude
when
one
siyyid
muhammad
by
name
of
isfahan
one
of
the
followers
of
the
bab
laid
the
foundations
of
intimacy
and
familiarity
with
mirza
yahya
and
thereby
became
the
cause
of
vexation
and
trouble
in
other
words
he
commenced
a
secret
intrigue
and
fell
to
tempting
mirza
yahya
saying
the
fame
of
this
sect
hath
risen
high
in
the
world
and
their
name
hath
become
noble
neither
dread
nor
danger
remaineth
nor
is
there
any
fear
or
need
for
caution
before
you
cease
then
to
follow
that
thou
mayest
be
followed
by
the
world
and
come
out
from
amongst
adherents
that
thou
mayest
become
celebrated
throughout
the
horizons
mirza
yahya
too
through
lack
of
reflection
and
thought
as
to
consequences
and
want
of
experience
became
enamored
of
his
words
and
befooled
by
his
conduct
this
one
was
like
the
sucking
child
and
that
one
became
as
the
muchprized
breast
at
all
events
how
much
soever
some
of
the
chiefs
of
the
sect
wrote
admonitions
and
pointed
out
to
him
the
path
of
discretion
saying
for
many
a
year
hast
thou
been
nurtured
in
thy
brothers
arms
and
hast
reposed
on
the
pillow
of
ease
and
gladness
what
thoughts
are
these
which
are
the
results
of
madness
be
not
beguiled
by
this
empty
name
which
out
of
regard
for
certain
considerations
and
as
a
matter
of
expediency
was
bestowed
upon
thee
neither
seek
to
be
censured
by
the
community
thy
rank
and
worth
depend
on
a
word
and
thine
exaltation
and
elevation
were
for
a
protection
and
a
consideration
yet
still
the
more
they
admonished
him
the
less
did
it
affect
him
and
how
much
soever
they
would
direct
him
he
continued
to
account
opposition
as
identical
with
advantage
afterwards
too
the
fire
of
greed
and
avarice
was
kindled
and
although
there
was
no
sort
of
need
their
circumstances
being
easy
in
the
extreme
they
fell
to
thinking
of
salary
and
stipend
and
certain
of
the
women
dependent
on
mirza
yahya
went
to
the
governors
palace
and
craved
assistance
and
charity
so
when
bahaullah
beheld
such
conduct
and
behavior
on
his
part
he
dismissed
and
drove
away
both
him
and
siyyid
muhammad
from
himself
then
siyyid
muhammad
set
out
for
constantinople
to
get
his
stipend
and
opened
the
door
of
suffering
according
to
the
account
given
this
matter
caused
the
greatest
sorrow
and
brought
about
cessation
of
intercourse
in
constantinople
moreover
he
presumptuously
set
afloat
certain
reports
asserting
amongst
other
things
that
the
notable
personage
who
had
come
from
iraq
was
mirza
yahya
sundry
individuals
perceiving
that
herein
was
excellent
material
for
mischiefmaking
and
a
means
for
the
promotion
of
mutiny
ostensibly
supported
and
applauded
him
and
stimulated
and
incited
him
saying
you
are
really
the
chief
support
and
acknowledged
successor
act
with
authority
in
order
that
grace
and
blessing
may
become
apparent
the
waveless
sea
hath
no
sound
and
the
cloud
without
thunder
raineth
no
rain
by
such
speech
then
was
that
unfortunate
man
entrapped
into
his
course
of
action
and
led
to
utter
vain
words
which
caused
the
disturbance
of
mens
thoughts
little
by
little
those
who
were
wont
to
incite
and
encourage
began
without
exception
to
utter
violent
denunciations
in
every
nook
and
corner
nay
in
the
court
itself
saying
the
babis
say
thus
and
expound
in
this
wise
their
behavior
is
such
and
their
speech
soandso
such
mischiefmaking
and
plots
caused
matters
to
become
misapprehended
and
furthermore
certain
schemes
got
afloat
which
were
regarded
as
necessary
measures
of
selfprotection
the
expediency
of
banishing
the
babis
came
under
consideration
and
all
of
a
sudden
an
order
came
and
bahaullah
was
removed
from
roumelia
nor
was
it
known
for
what
purpose
or
whither
they
would
bear
him
away
diverse
accounts
were
current
in
mens
mouths
and
many
exaggerations
were
heard
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
hope
of
deliverance
now
all
those
persons
who
were
with
him
with
one
accord
entreated
and
insisted
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
accompany
him
and
how
much
soever
the
government
admonished
and
forbade
them
it
was
fruitless
finally
one
haji
jafar
by
name
was
moved
to
lamentation
and
with
his
own
hand
cut
his
throat
when
the
government
beheld
it
thus
it
gave
permission
to
all
of
them
to
accompany
him
conveyed
them
from
adrianople
to
the
seashore
and
thence
transported
them
to
akka
mirza
yahya
they
sent
in
like
manner
to
famagusta
during
the
latter
days
passed
in
adrianople
bahaullah
composed
a
detailed
epistle
setting
forth
all
matters
clearly
and
minutely
he
unfolded
and
expounded
the
main
principles
of
the
sect
and
made
clear
and
plain
its
ethics
manners
course
and
mode
of
conduct
he
treated
certain
political
questions
in
detail
and
adduced
sundry
proofs
of
his
truthfulness
he
declared
the
good
intent
loyalty
and
sincerity
of
the
sect
and
wrote
some
fragments
of
prayers
some
in
persian
but
the
greater
part
in
arabic
he
then
placed
it
in
a
packet
and
adorned
its
address
with
the
royal
name
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
persia
and
wrote
on
it
that
some
person
pure
of
heart
and
pure
of
life
dedicated
to
god
and
prepared
for
martyrsacrifice
must
with
perfect
resignation
and
willingness
convey
this
epistle
into
the
presence
of
the
king
a
youth
named
mirza
badi
a
native
of
khurasan
took
the
epistle
and
hastened
toward
the
presence
of
his
majesty
the
king
the
royal
train
had
its
abode
and
station
outside
tihran
so
he
took
his
stand
alone
on
a
rock
in
a
place
far
off
but
opposite
to
the
royal
pavilion
and
awaited
day
and
night
the
passing
of
the
royal
escort
or
the
attainment
of
admission
into
the
imperial
presence
three
days
did
he
pass
in
a
state
of
fasting
and
vigilance
an
emaciated
body
and
enfeebled
spirit
remained
on
the
fourth
day
the
royal
personage
was
examining
all
quarters
and
directions
with
a
telescope
when
suddenly
his
glance
fell
on
this
man
who
was
seated
in
the
utmost
respectful
attitude
on
a
rock
it
was
inferred
from
the
indications
perceived
that
he
must
certainly
have
thanks
to
offer
or
some
complaint
or
demand
for
redress
and
justice
to
prefer
the
king
commanded
one
of
those
in
attendance
at
the
court
to
inquire
into
the
circumstances
of
this
youth
on
interrogation
it
was
found
that
he
carried
a
letter
which
he
desired
to
convey
with
his
own
hand
into
the
royal
presence
on
receiving
permission
to
approach
he
cried
out
before
the
pavilion
with
a
dignity
composure
and
respectfulness
surpassing
description
and
in
a
loud
voice
o
king
i
have
come
unto
thee
from
sheba
with
a
weighty
message
the
king
commanded
to
take
the
letter
and
arrest
the
bearer
his
majesty
the
king
wished
to
act
with
deliberation
and
desired
to
discover
the
truth
but
those
who
were
present
before
him
loosed
their
tongues
in
violent
reprehension
saying
this
person
has
shown
great
presumption
and
amazing
audacity
for
he
hath
without
fear
or
dread
brought
the
letter
of
him
against
whom
all
peoples
are
angered
of
him
who
is
banished
to
bulgaria
and
sclavonia
into
the
presence
of
the
king
if
so
be
that
he
do
not
instantly
suffer
a
grievous
punishment
there
will
be
an
increase
of
this
great
presumption
so
the
ministers
of
the
court
signified
that
he
should
suffer
punishment
and
ordered
the
torture
as
the
first
torment
they
applied
the
chain
and
rack
saying
make
known
thy
other
friends
that
thou
mayest
be
delivered
from
excruciating
punishment
and
make
thy
comrades
captive
that
thou
mayest
escape
from
the
torment
of
the
chain
and
the
keenness
of
the
sword
but
torture
brand
and
torment
him
as
they
might
they
saw
naught
but
steadfastness
and
silence
and
found
naught
but
dumb
endurance
on
his
part
so
when
the
torture
gave
no
result
they
first
photographed
him
the
executioners
on
his
left
and
on
his
right
and
he
sitting
bound
in
fetters
and
chains
beneath
the
sword
with
perfect
meekness
and
composure
and
then
slew
and
destroyed
him
this
photograph
i
sent
for
and
found
worthy
of
contemplation
for
he
was
seated
with
wonderful
humility
and
strange
submissiveness
in
utmost
resignation
now
when
his
majesty
the
king
had
perused
certain
passages
and
become
cognizant
of
the
contents
of
the
epistle
he
was
much
affected
at
what
had
taken
place
and
manifested
regret
because
his
courtiers
had
acted
hastily
and
put
into
execution
a
severe
punishment
it
is
even
related
that
he
said
thrice
doth
anyone
punish
one
who
is
but
the
channel
of
pages
correspondence
then
the
royal
command
was
issued
that
their
reverences
the
learned
doctors
and
honorable
and
accomplished
divines
should
write
a
reply
to
that
epistle
but
when
the
most
expert
doctors
of
the
capital
became
aware
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
they
ordained
that
this
person
without
regarding
the
fact
that
he
is
at
variance
with
the
perspicuous
religion
is
a
meddler
with
custom
and
creed
and
a
troubler
of
kings
and
emperors
therefore
to
eradicate
subdue
repress
and
repel
this
sect
is
one
of
the
requirements
of
the
wellestablished
path
and
indeed
the
chief
of
obligations
this
answer
was
not
approved
before
the
royal
presence
for
the
contents
of
this
epistle
had
no
obvious
discordance
with
the
law
or
with
reason
and
did
not
meddle
with
political
or
administrative
matters
nor
interfere
with
or
attack
the
throne
of
sovereignty
they
ought
therefore
to
have
discussed
the
real
points
at
issue
and
to
have
written
clearly
and
explicitly
such
an
answer
as
would
have
caused
the
disappearance
of
doubts
and
the
solution
of
difficulties
and
would
have
become
a
fulcrum
for
discussion
to
all
now
of
this
epistle
sundry
passages
shall
be
set
forth
in
writing
to
conduce
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
matter
by
all
people
at
the
beginning
of
the
epistle
was
a
striking
passage
in
the
arabic
language
treating
of
questions
of
faith
and
assurance
the
sacrifice
of
life
in
the
way
of
the
beloved
the
state
of
resignation
and
contentment
the
multiplicity
of
misfortunes
calamities
hardships
and
afflictions
and
falling
under
suspicion
of
seditiousness
through
the
machinations
of
foes
the
establishment
of
his
innocence
in
the
presence
of
his
majesty
the
king
the
repudiation
of
seditious
persons
and
disavowal
of
the
rebellious
party
the
conditions
of
sincere
belief
in
the
verses
of
the
quran
the
needfulness
of
godly
virtues
distinction
from
all
other
creatures
in
this
transitory
abode
obedience
to
the
commandments
and
avoidance
of
things
prohibited
the
evidence
of
divine
support
in
the
affair
of
the
bab
the
inability
of
whosoever
is
upon
the
earth
to
withstand
a
heavenly
thing
his
own
awakening
at
the
divine
afflux
and
his
falling
thereby
into
unbounded
calamities
his
acquisition
of
the
divine
gift
his
participation
in
spiritual
godgiven
grace
and
his
illumination
with
immediate
knowledge
without
study
the
excusableness
of
his
efforts
for
the
admonition
of
mankind
their
direction
toward
the
attainment
of
human
perfections
and
their
enkindlement
with
the
fire
of
divine
love
encouragements
to
the
directing
of
energy
towards
the
attainment
of
a
state
greater
than
the
degree
of
earthly
sovereignty
eloquent
prayers
written
in
the
utmost
selfabasement
devotion
and
humility
and
the
like
of
this
afterwards
he
discussed
other
matters
in
the
persian
language
and
the
form
of
it
is
this
o
god
this
is
a
letter
which
i
wish
to
send
to
the
king
and
thou
knowest
that
i
have
not
desired
aught
of
him
save
the
display
of
his
justice
to
thy
people
and
the
showing
forth
of
his
favors
to
the
dwellers
in
thy
kingdom
and
verily
by
my
soul
i
have
not
desired
aught
save
what
thou
hast
desired
neither
by
thy
might
do
i
desire
aught
save
what
thou
desirest
perish
that
being
which
desireth
of
thee
aught
save
thyself
and
by
thy
glory
thy
good
pleasure
is
the
limit
of
my
hope
and
thy
will
the
extremity
of
my
desire
be
merciful
then
o
god
to
this
poor
soul
who
hath
caught
hold
of
the
skirt
of
thy
richness
and
to
this
humble
suppliant
who
calleth
on
thee
for
thou
art
indeed
the
mighty
the
great
help
o
god
his
majesty
the
king
to
execute
thy
laws
amongst
thy
servants
and
to
show
forth
thy
justice
amidst
thy
creatures
that
he
may
rule
over
this
sect
as
he
ruleth
over
those
who
are
beside
them
verily
thou
art
the
potent
the
mighty
the
wise
agreeably
to
the
permission
and
consent
of
the
king
of
the
age
this
servant
turned
from
the
place
of
the
royal
throne
toward
iraqiarab
and
in
that
land
abode
twelve
years
during
the
period
of
his
sojourn
there
no
description
of
his
condition
was
laid
before
the
royal
presence
neither
did
any
representation
go
to
foreign
states
relying
upon
god
did
he
abide
in
that
land
until
a
certain
functionary
came
to
iraq
who
on
his
arrival
fell
to
designing
the
affliction
of
a
company
of
poor
unfortunates
every
day
beguiled
by
certain
of
the
doctors
of
persia
he
persecuted
these
servants
although
nothing
prejudicial
to
church
or
state
or
at
variance
with
the
principles
and
customs
of
their
countrymen
had
been
observed
in
them
so
this
servant
was
moved
by
this
reflection
may
it
not
be
that
by
reason
of
the
deeds
of
the
transgressors
some
action
at
variance
with
the
worldordering
counsel
of
the
king
should
be
engendered
therefore
was
an
epitome
of
the
matter
addressed
to
mirza
said
khan
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
that
he
might
submit
it
to
the
royal
presence
and
that
it
might
be
done
according
to
that
which
the
royal
command
might
promulgate
a
long
while
elapsed
and
no
command
was
issued
until
matters
reached
such
a
state
that
it
was
to
be
feared
that
sedition
might
suddenly
break
out
and
the
blood
of
many
be
shed
of
necessity
for
the
protection
of
the
servants
of
god
a
certain
number
of
the
babis
appealed
to
the
governor
of
iraq
if
the
king
will
consider
what
has
happened
with
just
regard
it
will
become
clear
in
the
mirror
of
his
luminous
heart
that
what
occurred
was
done
from
considerations
of
expediency
and
that
there
was
apparently
no
resource
save
this
the
royal
personage
can
bear
witness
and
testify
to
this
that
in
whatever
land
there
were
some
few
of
this
sect
the
fire
of
war
and
conflict
was
wont
to
be
kindled
by
reason
of
the
aggression
of
certain
governors
but
this
transient
one
after
his
arrival
in
iraq
withheld
all
from
sedition
and
strife
and
the
witness
of
this
servant
is
his
action
for
all
are
aware
and
will
testify
that
the
multitude
of
this
faction
in
persia
at
that
time
was
more
than
it
had
been
before
yet
notwithstanding
this
none
transgressed
his
proper
bounds
nor
assailed
anyone
it
is
nigh
on
fifteen
years
that
all
continue
tranquil
looking
unto
god
and
relying
on
him
and
bear
patiently
what
hath
come
upon
them
casting
it
on
god
and
after
the
arrival
of
this
servant
in
this
city
which
is
called
adrianople
certain
of
this
community
enquired
concerning
the
meaning
of
victory
diverse
answers
were
sent
in
reply
one
of
which
answers
will
be
submitted
on
this
page
so
that
it
may
become
clear
before
the
royal
presence
that
this
servant
hath
in
view
naught
save
peace
and
reform
and
if
some
of
the
divine
favors
which
without
merit
on
my
part
have
been
graciously
bestowed
on
me
do
not
become
evident
and
apparent
this
much
at
least
will
be
known
that
god
in
his
abounding
grace
and
undeserved
mercy
hath
not
deprived
this
oppressed
one
of
the
ornament
of
reason
the
form
of
words
which
was
set
forth
on
the
meaning
of
victory
is
this
he
is
god
exalted
is
he
it
hath
been
known
that
god
glorious
is
his
mention
is
sanctified
from
the
world
and
what
is
therein
and
that
the
meaning
of
victory
is
not
this
that
anyone
should
fight
or
strive
with
anyone
the
lord
of
he
doeth
what
he
will
hath
committed
the
kingdom
of
creation
both
land
and
sea
into
the
hand
of
kings
and
they
are
the
manifestations
of
the
divine
power
according
to
the
degrees
of
their
rank
verily
he
is
the
potent
the
sovereign
but
that
which
god
glorious
is
his
mention
hath
desired
for
himself
is
the
hearts
of
his
servants
which
are
treasures
of
praise
and
love
of
the
lord
and
stores
of
divine
knowledge
and
wisdom
the
will
of
the
eternal
king
hath
ever
been
to
purify
the
hearts
of
his
servants
from
the
promptings
of
the
world
and
what
is
therein
so
that
they
may
be
prepared
for
illumination
by
the
effulgences
of
the
lord
of
the
names
and
attributes
therefore
must
no
stranger
find
his
way
into
the
city
of
the
heart
so
that
the
incomparable
friend
may
come
unto
his
own
placethat
is
the
effulgence
of
his
names
and
attributes
not
his
essence
exalted
is
he
for
that
peerless
king
hath
been
and
will
be
holy
for
everlasting
above
ascent
or
descent
therefore
today
victory
neither
hath
been
nor
will
be
opposition
to
anyone
nor
strife
with
any
person
but
rather
what
is
wellpleasing
is
that
the
cities
of
mens
hearts
which
are
under
the
dominion
of
the
hosts
of
selfishness
and
lust
should
be
subdued
by
the
sword
of
the
word
of
wisdom
and
of
exhortation
everyone
then
who
desireth
victory
must
first
subdue
the
city
of
his
own
heart
with
the
sword
of
spiritual
truth
and
of
the
word
and
must
protect
it
from
remembering
aught
beside
god
afterwards
let
him
turn
his
regards
towards
the
cities
of
others
hearts
this
is
what
is
intended
by
victory
sedition
hath
never
been
nor
is
pleasing
to
god
and
that
which
certain
ignorant
persons
formerly
wrought
was
never
approved
if
ye
be
slain
for
his
good
pleasure
verily
it
is
better
for
you
than
that
ye
should
slay
today
the
friends
of
god
must
appear
in
such
fashion
amidst
gods
servants
that
by
their
actions
they
may
lead
all
unto
the
pleasure
of
the
lord
of
glory
i
swear
by
the
sun
of
the
horizon
of
holiness
that
the
friends
of
god
never
have
regarded
nor
will
regard
the
earth
or
its
transitory
riches
god
hath
ever
regarded
the
hearts
of
his
servants
and
this
too
is
by
reason
of
his
most
great
favor
that
perchance
mortal
souls
may
be
cleansed
and
sanctified
from
earthly
states
and
may
attain
unto
everlasting
places
but
that
real
king
is
in
himself
sufficient
unto
himself
and
independent
of
all
neither
doth
any
advantage
accrue
to
him
from
the
love
of
contingent
beings
nor
doth
any
hurt
befall
him
from
their
hatred
all
earthly
places
appear
through
him
and
unto
him
return
and
god
singly
and
alone
abideth
in
his
own
place
which
is
holy
above
space
and
time
mention
and
utterance
sign
description
and
definition
height
and
depth
and
none
knoweth
this
save
him
and
whosoever
hath
knowledge
of
the
book
there
is
no
god
but
him
the
mighty
the
bountiful
finis
but
good
deeds
depend
on
this
that
the
royal
person
should
himself
look
into
that
matter
with
just
and
gracious
regard
and
not
be
satisfied
with
the
representations
of
certain
persons
unsupported
by
proof
or
evidence
we
ask
god
to
strengthen
the
king
unto
that
which
he
willeth
and
what
he
willeth
should
be
the
wish
of
the
worlds
afterwards
they
summoned
this
servant
to
constantinople
we
reached
that
city
along
with
a
number
of
poor
unfortunates
and
after
our
arrival
did
not
hold
intercourse
with
a
single
soul
for
we
had
naught
to
say
unto
them
and
there
was
no
wish
save
that
it
should
be
clearly
demonstrated
by
proof
to
all
that
this
servant
had
no
thought
of
sedition
and
had
never
associated
with
the
seditious
and
by
him
in
praise
of
whose
spirit
the
tongues
of
all
things
speak
to
turn
in
any
direction
was
difficult
in
consideration
of
certain
circumstances
but
these
things
were
done
for
the
protection
of
lives
verily
my
lord
knoweth
what
is
in
my
soul
and
verily
he
is
witness
unto
what
i
say
the
just
king
is
the
shadow
of
god
in
the
earth
all
should
take
refuge
under
the
shadow
of
his
justice
and
rest
in
the
shade
of
his
favor
this
is
not
the
place
for
personalities
or
censures
directed
specially
against
some
apart
from
others
for
the
shadow
tells
of
him
who
casteth
the
shadow
god
glorious
is
his
mention
hath
called
himself
the
lord
of
the
worlds
for
that
he
hath
nurtured
and
doth
nurture
all
exalted
is
his
favor
which
hath
preceded
contingent
beings
and
his
mercy
which
hath
preceded
the
worlds
this
is
sufficiently
clear
that
whether
right
or
wrong
according
to
the
imagination
of
the
people
this
community
have
accepted
as
true
and
adopted
the
religion
for
which
they
are
notorious
and
that
on
this
account
they
have
foregone
what
they
had
seeking
after
what
is
with
god
and
this
same
renunciation
of
life
in
the
way
of
love
for
the
merciful
god
is
a
faithful
witness
and
an
eloquent
attest
unto
that
whereunto
they
lay
claim
hath
it
ever
been
beheld
that
a
reasonable
man
renounced
his
life
without
proof
or
evidence
of
the
truth
of
that
for
which
he
died
and
if
it
be
said
this
people
are
mad
this
too
is
very
improbable
for
it
is
not
a
thing
confined
to
one
or
two
persons
but
rather
have
a
great
multitude
of
every
class
inebriated
with
the
kawthar
of
divine
wisdom
hastened
with
heart
and
soul
to
the
place
of
martyrdom
in
the
way
of
the
friend
if
these
persons
who
for
god
have
foregone
all
save
him
and
who
have
poured
forth
life
and
wealth
in
his
way
can
be
belied
then
by
what
proof
and
evidence
shall
the
truth
of
that
which
others
assert
concerning
that
wherein
they
are
be
established
in
the
presence
of
the
king
the
late
haji
siyyid
muhammad
may
god
exalt
his
station
and
overwhelm
him
in
the
depth
of
the
ocean
of
his
mercy
and
forgiveness
although
he
was
of
the
most
learned
of
the
doctors
of
the
age
and
the
most
pious
and
austere
of
his
contemporaries
and
although
the
splendor
of
his
worth
was
of
such
a
degree
that
the
tongues
of
all
creatures
spoke
in
praise
and
eulogy
of
him
and
confidently
asserted
his
asceticism
and
godliness
did
nevertheless
in
the
war
against
the
russians
forego
much
good
and
turn
back
after
a
little
contest
although
he
himself
had
decreed
a
holy
war
and
had
set
out
from
his
native
country
with
conspicuous
ensign
in
support
of
the
faith
o
would
that
the
covering
might
be
withdrawn
and
that
what
is
hidden
from
mens
eyes
might
appear
but
as
to
this
sect
it
is
twenty
years
and
more
that
they
have
been
tormented
by
day
and
by
night
with
the
fierceness
of
the
royal
anger
and
that
they
have
been
cast
each
one
into
a
different
land
by
the
blasts
of
the
tempests
of
the
kings
wrath
how
many
children
have
been
left
fatherless
how
many
fathers
have
become
childless
how
many
mothers
have
not
dared
through
fear
and
dread
to
mourn
over
their
slaughtered
children
many
were
the
servants
of
god
who
at
eve
were
in
the
utmost
wealth
and
opulence
and
at
dawn
were
beheld
in
the
extreme
of
poverty
and
abasement
there
is
no
land
but
hath
been
dyed
with
their
blood
and
no
air
whereunto
their
groanings
have
not
arisen
and
during
these
few
years
the
arrows
of
affliction
have
rained
down
without
intermission
from
the
clouds
of
fate
yet
notwithstanding
all
these
visitations
and
afflictions
the
fire
of
divine
love
is
in
such
fashion
kindled
in
their
hearts
that
were
they
all
to
be
hewn
in
pieces
they
would
not
forswear
the
love
of
the
beloved
of
all
the
dwellers
upon
earth
nay
rather
with
their
whole
souls
do
they
yearn
and
hope
for
what
may
befall
them
in
the
way
of
god
o
king
the
gales
of
the
mercy
of
the
merciful
one
have
converted
these
servants
and
drawn
them
to
the
region
of
the
divine
unitythe
witness
of
the
faithful
lover
is
in
his
sleevebut
some
of
the
doctors
of
persia
have
troubled
the
most
luminous
heart
of
the
king
of
the
age
with
regard
to
those
who
are
admitted
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
merciful
one
and
those
who
make
for
the
kaaba
of
wisdom
o
would
that
the
worldordering
judgment
of
the
king
might
decide
that
this
servant
should
meet
those
doctors
and
in
the
presence
of
his
majesty
the
king
adduce
arguments
and
proofs
this
servant
is
ready
and
hopeth
of
god
that
such
a
conference
may
be
brought
about
so
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
may
become
evident
and
apparent
before
his
majesty
the
king
and
afterwards
the
decision
is
in
thy
hand
and
i
am
ready
to
confront
the
throne
of
thy
sovereignty
then
give
judgment
for
me
or
against
me
the
merciful
lord
saith
in
the
furqan
which
is
the
enduring
proof
amidst
the
host
of
existences
desire
death
then
if
ye
be
sincere
he
hath
declared
the
desiring
of
death
to
be
the
proof
of
sincerity
and
it
will
be
apparent
in
the
mirror
of
the
kings
luminous
mind
which
party
it
is
that
hath
this
day
foregone
life
in
the
way
of
him
who
is
adored
by
the
dwellers
upon
earth
had
the
doctrinal
books
of
this
people
composed
in
proof
of
that
wherein
they
are
been
written
with
the
blood
which
has
been
shed
in
his
way
exalted
is
he
books
innumerable
would
assuredly
have
been
apparent
and
visible
amongst
mankind
how
then
can
one
repudiate
this
people
whose
words
and
deeds
are
consistent
and
accept
those
persons
who
neither
have
foregone
nor
will
forego
one
atom
of
the
consideration
which
they
enjoy
in
the
way
of
god
the
sovereign
some
of
the
doctors
of
persia
who
have
denounced
this
servant
have
never
either
met
or
seen
him
nor
even
become
cognizant
of
his
intent
nevertheless
they
said
what
they
desired
and
do
what
they
will
every
statement
requires
proof
and
is
not
established
merely
by
assertion
or
by
outward
gear
of
asceticism
a
translation
of
some
passages
from
the
contents
of
the
hidden
book
of
fatimih
upon
her
be
the
blessings
of
god
which
are
apposite
to
this
place
will
now
be
submitted
in
the
persian
language
in
order
that
some
things
now
concealed
may
be
revealed
before
the
royal
presence
those
addressed
in
these
utterances
in
the
abovementioned
book
which
is
today
known
as
hidden
words
are
those
people
who
are
outwardly
notable
for
science
and
piety
but
who
are
inwardly
subservient
to
their
passions
and
lust
he
says
o
faithless
ones
why
do
ye
outwardly
claim
to
be
shepherds
while
inwardly
ye
have
become
the
wolves
of
my
sheep
your
likeness
is
like
unto
the
star
before
the
morning
which
is
apparently
bright
and
luminous
but
really
causeth
the
misguidance
and
destruction
of
the
caravans
of
my
city
and
country
so
likewise
he
saith
o
outwardly
fair
and
inwardly
faulty
thy
likeness
is
like
unto
clear
bitter
water
wherein
outwardly
the
utmost
sweetness
and
purity
is
beheld
but
when
it
falleth
into
the
assaying
hands
of
the
taste
of
the
divine
unity
he
doth
not
accept
a
single
drop
thereof
the
radiance
of
the
sun
is
on
the
earth
and
on
the
mirror
alike
but
regard
the
difference
as
from
the
guardstars
to
the
earth
nay
between
them
is
a
limitless
distance
so
likewise
he
saith
o
child
of
the
world
many
a
morning
hath
the
effulgence
of
my
grace
come
unto
thy
place
from
the
dayspring
of
the
placeless
found
thee
on
the
couch
of
ease
busied
with
other
things
and
returned
like
the
lightning
of
the
spirit
to
the
bright
abode
of
glory
and
i
desiring
not
thy
shame
declared
it
not
in
the
retreats
of
nearness
to
the
hosts
of
holiness
so
likewise
he
saith
o
pretender
to
my
friendship
in
the
morning
the
breeze
of
my
grace
passed
by
thee
and
found
thee
sleeping
on
the
bed
of
heedlessness
and
wept
over
thy
condition
and
turned
back
finis
in
the
presence
of
the
kings
justice
therefore
the
statement
of
an
adversary
ought
not
to
be
accepted
as
sufficient
and
in
the
furqan
which
distinguisheth
between
truth
and
falsehood
he
says
o
ye
who
believe
if
there
come
unto
you
a
sinner
with
a
message
then
discriminate
lest
you
fall
upon
a
people
in
ignorance
and
on
the
morrow
repent
of
what
ye
have
done
and
it
hath
come
down
in
holy
tradition
credit
not
the
calumniator
the
matter
hath
been
misapprehended
by
certain
doctors
neither
have
they
seen
this
servant
but
those
persons
who
have
met
him
testify
that
this
servant
hath
not
spoken
contrary
to
that
which
god
hath
ordained
in
the
book
and
recite
this
blessed
verse
he
saith
exalted
is
he
do
ye
disavow
us
for
aught
save
that
we
believe
in
god
and
what
hath
been
sent
down
unto
us
and
what
was
sent
down
before
o
king
of
the
age
the
eyes
of
these
wanderers
turn
and
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
mercy
of
the
merciful
one
and
assuredly
to
these
afflictions
shall
the
greatest
mercy
succeed
and
after
these
most
grievous
hardships
shall
follow
great
ease
but
our
hope
is
this
that
his
majesty
the
king
will
himself
turn
his
attention
to
these
matters
which
thing
will
be
the
cause
of
hope
in
our
hearts
and
this
is
unmixed
good
which
hath
been
submitted
and
god
sufficeth
for
a
witness
glory
be
to
thee
o
god
o
god
i
bear
witness
that
the
heart
of
the
king
is
between
the
fingers
of
thy
power
if
thou
pleasest
turn
it
o
god
in
the
direction
of
mercy
and
kindliness
verily
thou
art
the
exalted
the
potent
the
beneficent
there
is
no
god
but
thee
the
mighty
from
whom
help
is
sought
concerning
the
qualifications
of
the
doctors
he
saith
but
amongst
the
lawyers
he
who
guardeth
himself
observeth
his
religion
opposeth
his
lust
and
obeyeth
the
command
of
his
lordit
is
incumbent
on
the
people
to
follow
him
unto
the
end
and
if
the
king
of
the
age
will
regard
this
utterance
which
proceeded
from
the
tongue
of
the
recipient
of
divine
inspiration
he
will
observe
that
those
characterized
by
the
qualities
transmitted
in
the
aforementioned
tradition
are
rarer
than
the
philosophers
stone
therefore
the
claim
of
every
person
pretending
to
science
neither
hath
been
nor
is
heard
so
likewise
in
describing
the
lawyers
of
the
latter
time
he
says
the
lawyers
of
that
time
are
the
most
evil
of
lawyers
under
the
shadow
of
heaven
from
them
cometh
forth
mischief
and
unto
them
it
returneth
and
if
any
person
deny
these
traditions
the
establishing
thereof
is
incumbent
on
this
servant
but
since
our
object
is
brevity
therefore
the
detail
of
the
authorities
hath
not
been
submitted
those
doctors
who
have
indeed
drunk
of
the
cup
of
renunciation
never
interfered
with
this
servant
even
as
the
late
shaykh
murtada
may
god
exalt
his
station
and
cause
him
to
dwell
under
the
shadow
of
the
domes
of
his
grace
used
to
show
us
affection
during
the
days
of
our
sojourn
in
iraq
and
used
not
to
speak
concerning
this
matter
otherwise
than
god
hath
permitted
we
ask
god
to
help
all
men
unto
that
which
he
loveth
and
approveth
now
all
people
have
shut
their
eyes
to
all
these
matters
and
are
bent
on
the
persecution
of
this
sect
so
that
should
it
be
demanded
of
certain
persons
who
after
gods
grace
rest
in
the
shadow
of
the
kings
clemency
and
enjoy
unbounded
blessings
in
return
for
the
kings
favor
what
service
have
ye
wrought
have
ye
by
wise
policy
added
any
country
to
his
countries
or
have
ye
applied
yourselves
to
aught
which
would
cause
the
comfort
of
the
people
the
prosperity
of
the
kingdom
and
the
continuance
of
fair
fame
for
the
state
they
have
no
reply
save
this
that
falsely
or
truly
they
designate
a
number
of
persons
in
the
presence
of
the
king
by
the
name
of
babis
and
forthwith
engage
in
slaughter
and
plunder
even
as
in
tabriz
and
elsewhere
they
sold
certain
ones
and
received
much
wealth
and
this
was
never
represented
before
the
presence
of
the
king
all
these
things
have
occurred
because
of
this
that
they
have
found
these
poor
people
without
a
helper
they
have
foregone
matters
of
moment
and
have
fallen
upon
these
poor
unfortunates
many
sects
and
diverse
tribes
rest
tranquil
in
the
shadow
of
the
king
and
of
these
sects
one
is
this
people
were
it
not
best
that
the
lofty
endeavor
and
magnanimity
of
those
who
surround
the
king
should
be
so
witnessed
that
they
should
be
scheming
for
all
factions
to
come
under
the
kings
shadow
and
that
they
should
govern
amidst
all
with
justice
to
put
in
force
the
ordinances
of
god
is
unmixed
justice
and
with
this
all
are
satisfied
nay
the
ordinances
of
god
ever
have
been
and
will
be
the
instrument
and
means
for
the
protection
of
his
creatures
as
he
saith
exalted
is
he
and
in
retaliation
ye
have
life
o
people
of
understanding
but
it
is
far
from
the
justice
of
his
majesty
the
king
that
for
the
fault
of
one
person
a
number
of
persons
should
become
the
objects
of
the
scourges
of
wrath
god
glorious
is
his
mention
saith
none
shall
bear
the
burden
of
another
and
this
is
sufficiently
evident
that
in
every
community
there
have
been
and
will
be
learned
and
ignorant
wise
and
foolish
sinful
and
pious
and
to
commit
abominable
actions
is
far
from
the
wise
man
for
the
wise
man
either
seeketh
the
world
or
abandoneth
it
if
he
abandoneth
it
assuredly
he
will
not
regard
aught
save
god
and
apart
from
this
the
fear
of
god
will
withhold
him
from
committing
forbidden
and
culpable
actions
and
if
he
seeketh
the
world
he
will
assuredly
not
commit
deeds
which
will
cause
and
induce
the
aversion
of
gods
servants
and
produce
horror
in
those
who
are
in
all
lands
but
rather
will
he
practice
such
deeds
as
will
cause
the
adhesion
of
mankind
so
it
hath
been
demonstrated
that
detestable
actions
have
been
and
will
be
wrought
only
by
ignorant
persons
we
ask
god
to
keep
his
servants
from
regarding
aught
but
him
and
to
bring
them
near
to
him
verily
he
is
potent
over
all
things
glory
be
to
thee
o
god
o
my
god
thou
hearest
my
groaning
and
seest
my
state
and
my
distress
and
my
affliction
and
knowest
what
is
in
my
soul
if
my
cry
be
sincerely
for
thy
sake
then
draw
thereby
the
hearts
of
thy
creatures
unto
the
horizon
of
the
heaven
of
thy
recognition
and
turn
the
king
unto
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
thy
name
the
merciful
then
bestow
on
him
o
my
god
the
blessing
which
hath
descended
from
the
heaven
of
thy
favor
and
the
clouds
of
thy
mercy
that
he
may
sever
himself
from
that
which
he
hath
and
turn
toward
the
region
of
thy
bounties
o
lord
help
him
to
support
the
oppressed
amongst
thy
servants
and
to
raise
up
thy
word
amidst
thy
people
then
aid
him
with
the
hosts
of
the
unseen
and
the
seen
that
he
may
subdue
cities
in
thy
name
and
rule
over
all
who
are
upon
the
earth
by
thy
power
and
authority
o
thou
in
whose
hand
is
the
kingdom
of
creation
and
verily
thou
art
he
who
ruleth
at
the
beginning
and
in
the
end
there
is
no
god
save
thee
the
potent
the
mighty
the
wise
they
have
misrepresented
matters
before
the
presence
of
the
king
in
such
a
way
that
if
any
ill
deed
proceed
from
any
one
of
this
sect
they
account
it
as
a
part
of
the
religion
of
these
servants
but
by
god
beside
whom
there
is
none
other
god
this
servant
hath
not
sanctioned
the
committing
of
sins
much
less
that
whereof
the
prohibition
hath
been
explicitly
revealed
in
the
book
of
god
god
hath
prohibited
unto
men
the
drinking
of
wine
and
the
unlawfulness
thereof
hath
been
revealed
and
recorded
in
the
book
of
god
and
the
doctors
of
the
age
may
god
multiply
the
like
of
them
have
unanimously
prohibited
unto
men
this
abominable
action
yet
withal
do
some
commit
it
now
the
punishment
of
this
action
falls
on
these
heedless
persons
while
those
manifestations
of
the
glory
of
sanctity
continue
holy
and
undefiled
unto
their
sanctity
all
being
whether
of
the
unseen
or
the
seen
testifieth
yea
these
servants
of
god
regard
god
as
doing
what
he
pleaseth
and
ordering
what
he
willeth
there
is
no
retreat
nor
way
of
flight
for
anyone
save
unto
god
and
no
refuge
nor
asylum
but
in
him
and
at
no
time
hath
the
caviling
of
men
whether
learned
or
unlearned
been
a
thing
to
rely
on
nor
will
it
be
so
the
very
prophets
who
are
the
pearls
of
the
ocean
of
unity
and
the
recipients
of
divine
revelation
have
ever
been
the
objects
of
mens
aversion
and
caviling
much
more
these
servants
even
as
he
saith
every
nation
schemed
against
their
apostle
to
catch
him
and
they
contended
with
falsehood
therewith
to
refute
the
truth
so
likewise
he
saith
there
came
not
unto
them
any
apostle
but
they
mocked
at
him
consider
the
appearance
of
the
seal
of
the
prophets
the
king
of
the
elect
the
soul
of
the
worlds
be
his
sacrifice
after
the
dawning
of
the
sun
of
truth
from
the
horizon
of
the
hijaz
what
wrongs
befell
that
manifestation
of
the
might
of
the
lord
of
glory
at
the
hands
of
the
people
of
error
so
heedless
were
men
that
they
were
wont
to
consider
the
vexation
of
that
holy
one
as
one
of
the
greatest
of
good
works
and
as
the
means
of
approaching
god
most
high
for
in
the
first
years
the
doctors
of
that
age
whether
jews
or
christians
turned
aside
from
that
sun
of
the
highest
horizon
and
at
the
turning
aside
of
those
persons
all
whether
humble
or
noble
girt
up
their
loins
to
quench
the
radiance
of
that
light
of
the
horizon
of
ideals
the
names
of
all
are
recorded
in
books
amongst
them
were
wahb
ibn
rahib
kab
ibn
ashraf
abdullah
ibn
ubayy
and
the
like
of
these
persons
till
at
length
the
matter
reached
such
a
point
that
they
convened
a
meeting
to
take
counsel
as
to
the
shedding
of
the
most
pure
blood
of
that
holy
one
as
god
glorious
is
his
mention
hath
declared
and
when
those
who
misbelieved
plotted
against
thee
to
confine
thee
or
slay
thee
or
drive
thee
out
and
they
plotted
and
god
plotted
and
god
is
the
best
of
plotters
so
likewise
he
saith
and
if
their
aversion
be
grievous
unto
thee
then
if
thou
art
able
to
seek
out
a
hole
down
into
the
earth
or
a
ladder
up
into
the
sky
that
thou
mayest
show
them
a
signdo
so
but
if
god
pleased
he
would
assuredly
bring
them
all
to
the
true
guidance
be
not
therefore
one
of
the
ignorant
by
god
the
hearts
of
those
near
unto
god
are
scorched
at
the
purport
of
these
two
blessed
verses
but
the
like
of
these
matters
certainly
transmitted
to
us
are
blotted
out
of
sight
and
men
have
not
reflected
neither
do
reflect
what
was
the
reason
of
the
turning
aside
of
gods
servants
at
the
appearance
of
the
daysprings
of
divine
lights
so
too
before
the
seal
of
the
prophets
consider
jesus
the
son
of
mary
after
the
appearance
of
that
manifestation
of
the
merciful
one
all
the
doctors
charged
that
quintessence
of
faith
with
misbelief
and
rebelliousness
until
at
length
with
the
consent
of
annas
who
was
the
chief
of
the
doctors
of
that
age
and
likewise
caiaphas
who
was
the
most
learned
of
the
judges
they
wrought
upon
that
holy
one
that
which
the
pen
is
ashamed
and
unable
to
repeat
the
earth
with
its
amplitude
was
too
strait
for
him
until
god
took
him
up
into
the
heaven
but
were
a
detailed
account
of
the
prophets
to
be
submitted
it
is
feared
that
weariness
might
result
o
would
that
thou
mightest
permit
o
king
that
we
should
send
unto
thy
majesty
that
whereby
eyes
would
be
refreshed
souls
tranquilized
and
every
just
person
assured
that
with
him
ie
bahaullah
is
knowledge
of
the
book
were
it
not
for
the
turning
aside
of
the
ignorant
and
the
willful
blindness
of
the
doctors
verily
i
would
utter
a
discourse
whereat
hearts
would
be
glad
and
would
fly
unto
the
air
from
the
murmur
of
whose
winds
is
heard
there
is
no
god
but
he
but
now
because
the
time
admitteth
it
not
the
tongue
is
withheld
from
utterance
and
the
vessel
of
declaration
is
sealed
until
god
shall
unclose
it
by
his
power
verily
he
is
the
potent
the
powerful
glory
be
to
thee
o
god
o
my
god
i
ask
of
thee
in
thy
name
whereby
thou
hast
subdued
whomsoever
is
in
the
heavens
and
the
earth
that
thou
wilt
keep
the
lamp
of
thy
religion
with
the
glass
of
thy
power
and
thy
favors
so
that
the
winds
of
denial
pass
not
by
it
from
the
region
of
those
who
are
heedless
of
the
mysteries
of
thy
sovereign
name
then
increase
its
light
by
the
oil
of
thy
wisdom
verily
thou
art
potent
over
whomsoever
is
in
thy
earth
and
thy
heaven
o
lord
i
ask
of
thee
by
the
supreme
word
whereat
whosoever
is
in
the
earth
and
the
heaven
feareth
save
him
who
taketh
hold
of
the
most
firm
handle
that
thou
wilt
not
abandon
me
amongst
thy
creatures
lift
me
up
unto
thee
and
make
me
to
enter
in
under
the
shadow
of
thy
mercy
and
give
me
to
drink
of
the
pure
wine
of
thy
grace
that
i
may
dwell
under
the
canopy
of
thy
glory
and
the
domes
of
thy
favors
verily
thou
art
powerful
unto
that
thou
wishest
and
verily
thou
art
the
protecting
the
selfsufficing
o
king
the
lamps
of
justice
are
extinguished
and
the
fire
of
persecution
is
kindled
on
all
sides
until
that
they
have
made
my
people
captives
this
is
not
the
first
honor
which
hath
been
violated
in
the
way
of
god
it
behooveth
everyone
to
regard
and
recall
what
befell
the
kindred
of
the
prophet
until
that
the
people
made
them
captives
and
brought
them
in
unto
damascus
the
spacious
and
amongst
them
was
the
prince
of
worshipers
the
stay
of
the
elect
the
sanctuary
of
the
eager
the
soul
of
all
beside
him
be
his
sacrifice
it
was
said
unto
them
are
ye
seceders
he
said
no
by
god
we
are
servants
who
have
believed
in
god
and
in
his
signs
and
through
us
the
teeth
of
faith
are
disclosed
in
a
smile
and
the
sign
of
the
merciful
one
shineth
forth
through
our
mention
spreadeth
albatha
and
the
darkness
which
intervened
between
earth
and
heaven
is
dispelled
it
was
said
have
ye
forbidden
what
god
hath
sanctioned
or
sanctioned
what
god
hath
forbidden
he
said
we
were
the
first
who
followed
the
commandments
of
god
we
are
the
source
of
command
and
its
origin
and
the
firstfruits
of
all
good
and
its
consummation
we
are
the
sign
of
the
eternal
and
his
commemoration
amongst
the
nations
it
was
said
have
ye
abandoned
the
quran
he
said
through
us
did
the
merciful
one
reveal
it
and
we
are
gales
of
the
allglorious
amidst
his
creatures
we
are
streams
which
have
arisen
from
the
most
mighty
ocean
whereby
god
revived
the
earth
after
its
death
from
us
his
signs
are
diffused
his
evidences
are
manifested
and
his
tokens
appear
and
with
us
are
his
mysteries
and
his
secrets
it
was
said
for
what
fault
then
were
ye
afflicted
he
said
for
the
love
of
god
and
our
severance
from
all
beside
him
verily
we
have
not
repeated
his
expressions
upon
him
be
peace
but
rather
we
have
made
manifest
a
spray
from
the
ocean
of
life
which
was
deposited
in
his
words
that
by
it
those
who
advance
may
live
and
be
aware
of
what
hath
befallen
the
trusted
ones
of
god
on
the
part
of
an
evil
and
most
reprobate
people
and
today
we
see
the
people
censuring
those
who
acted
unjustly
of
yore
while
they
oppress
more
vehemently
than
those
oppressed
and
know
it
not
by
god
i
do
not
desire
sedition
but
the
purification
of
gods
servants
from
all
that
withholdeth
them
from
approach
to
god
the
king
of
the
day
of
invocation
i
was
asleep
on
my
couch
the
breaths
of
my
lord
the
merciful
passed
over
me
and
awakened
me
from
sleep
to
this
bear
witness
the
denizens
of
the
realms
of
his
power
and
his
kingdom
and
the
dwellers
in
the
cities
of
his
glory
and
himself
the
true
i
am
not
impatient
of
calamities
in
his
way
nor
of
afflictions
for
his
love
and
at
his
good
pleasure
god
hath
made
affliction
as
a
morning
shower
to
this
green
pasture
and
as
a
match
for
his
lamp
whereby
earth
and
heaven
are
illumined
shall
that
which
anyone
hath
of
wealth
endure
unto
him
or
avail
him
tomorrow
with
him
who
holdeth
his
forelock
if
any
should
look
on
those
who
sleep
under
slabs
and
keep
company
with
the
dust
can
he
distinguish
the
bones
of
the
kings
skull
from
the
knuckles
of
the
slave
no
by
the
king
of
kings
or
doth
he
know
governors
from
herdsmen
or
discern
the
wealthy
and
the
rich
from
him
who
was
without
shoes
or
carpet
by
god
distinction
is
removed
save
for
him
who
fulfilled
righteousness
and
judged
uprightly
where
are
the
doctors
the
scholars
the
nobles
where
is
the
keenness
of
their
glances
the
sharpness
of
their
sight
the
subtlety
of
their
thoughts
the
soundness
of
their
understandings
where
are
their
hidden
treasures
and
their
apparent
gauds
their
bejeweled
thrones
and
their
ample
couches
alas
all
have
been
laid
waste
and
the
decree
of
god
hath
rendered
them
as
scattered
dust
emptied
is
what
they
treasured
up
and
dissipated
is
what
they
collected
and
dispersed
is
what
they
concealed
they
have
become
such
that
thou
seest
naught
but
their
empty
places
their
gaping
roofs
their
uprooted
beams
their
new
things
waxed
old
as
for
the
discerning
man
verily
wealth
will
not
divert
him
from
regarding
the
end
and
for
the
prudent
man
riches
will
not
withhold
him
from
turning
toward
god
the
rich
the
exalted
where
is
he
who
held
dominion
over
all
whereon
the
sun
arose
and
who
spent
lavishly
and
sought
after
curious
things
in
the
world
and
what
is
therein
created
where
is
the
lord
of
the
swarthy
squadron
and
the
yellow
standard
where
is
he
who
ruled
zawra
and
where
he
who
wrought
injustice
in
damascus
the
spacious
where
are
they
at
whose
bounty
treasures
were
afraid
at
whose
openhandedness
and
generosity
the
ocean
was
dismayed
where
is
he
whose
arm
was
stretched
forth
in
rebelliousness
whose
heart
turned
away
from
the
merciful
one
where
is
he
who
used
to
make
choice
of
pleasures
and
cull
the
fruits
of
desires
where
are
the
dames
of
the
bridal
chambers
and
the
possessors
of
beauty
where
are
their
waving
branches
and
their
spreading
boughs
their
lofty
palaces
and
trellised
gardens
where
is
the
smoothness
of
the
expanses
thereof
and
the
softness
of
their
breezes
the
rippling
of
their
waters
and
the
murmur
of
their
winds
the
cooing
of
their
doves
and
the
rustling
of
their
trees
where
are
their
laughing
hearts
and
their
smiling
teeth
woe
unto
them
they
have
descended
to
the
abyss
and
become
companions
to
the
pebbles
today
no
mention
is
heard
of
them
nor
any
sound
nothing
is
known
of
them
nor
any
hint
will
the
people
dispute
it
while
they
behold
it
will
they
deny
it
when
they
know
it
i
know
not
in
what
valley
they
wander
erringly
do
they
not
see
that
they
depart
and
return
not
how
long
will
they
be
famous
in
the
low
countries
and
in
the
high
descend
and
ascend
is
not
the
time
yet
come
to
those
who
believe
for
their
hearts
to
become
humble
for
the
remembrance
of
god
well
is
it
with
that
one
who
hath
said
or
shall
say
yea
o
lord
the
time
is
ripe
and
hath
come
and
who
severeth
himself
from
all
that
is
alas
naught
is
reaped
but
what
is
sown
and
naught
is
taken
but
what
is
laid
up
save
by
the
grace
of
god
and
his
favor
hath
the
earth
conceived
him
whom
the
veils
of
glory
prevent
not
from
ascending
into
the
kingdom
of
his
lord
the
mighty
the
supreme
have
we
any
good
works
whereby
defects
shall
be
removed
or
which
shall
bring
us
near
unto
the
lord
of
causes
we
ask
god
to
deal
with
us
according
to
his
grace
not
his
justice
and
to
make
us
of
those
who
turn
toward
him
and
sever
themselves
from
all
beside
him
o
king
i
have
seen
in
the
way
of
god
what
no
eye
hath
seen
and
no
ear
hath
heard
friends
have
disclaimed
me
ways
are
straitened
unto
me
the
pool
of
safety
is
dried
up
the
plain
of
ease
is
scorched
yellow
how
many
calamities
have
descended
and
how
many
will
descend
i
walk
advancing
toward
the
mighty
the
bounteous
while
behind
me
glides
the
serpent
my
eyes
rain
down
tears
until
my
bed
is
drenched
but
my
sorrow
is
not
for
myself
by
god
my
head
longeth
for
the
spears
for
the
love
of
its
lord
and
i
never
pass
by
a
tree
but
my
heart
addresseth
it
saying
o
would
that
thou
wert
cut
down
in
my
name
and
my
body
were
crucified
upon
thee
in
the
way
of
my
lord
yea
because
i
see
mankind
going
astray
in
their
intoxication
and
they
know
it
not
they
have
exalted
their
lusts
and
put
aside
their
god
as
though
they
took
the
command
of
god
for
a
mockery
a
sport
and
a
plaything
and
they
think
that
they
do
well
and
that
they
are
harbored
in
the
citadel
of
security
the
matter
is
not
as
they
suppose
tomorrow
they
shall
see
what
they
now
deny
we
are
about
to
shift
from
this
most
remote
place
of
banishment
unto
the
prison
of
akka
and
according
to
what
they
say
it
is
assuredly
the
most
desolate
of
the
cities
of
the
world
the
most
unsightly
of
them
in
appearance
the
most
detestable
in
climate
and
the
foulest
in
water
it
is
as
though
it
were
the
metropolis
of
the
owl
there
is
not
heard
from
its
regions
aught
save
the
sound
of
its
hooting
and
in
it
they
intend
to
imprison
the
servant
and
to
shut
in
our
faces
the
doors
of
leniency
and
take
away
from
us
the
good
things
of
the
life
of
the
world
during
what
remaineth
of
our
days
by
god
though
weariness
should
weaken
me
and
hunger
should
destroy
me
though
my
couch
should
be
made
of
the
hard
rock
and
my
associates
of
the
beasts
of
the
desert
i
will
not
blench
but
will
be
patient
as
the
resolute
and
determined
are
patient
in
the
strength
of
god
the
king
of
preexistence
the
creator
of
the
nations
and
under
all
circumstances
i
give
thanks
unto
god
and
we
hope
of
his
graciousness
exalted
is
he
the
freedom
of
our
necks
from
chains
and
shackles
in
this
imprisonment
and
that
he
will
render
all
mens
faces
sincere
toward
him
the
mighty
the
bounteous
verily
he
answereth
him
who
prayeth
unto
him
and
is
near
unto
him
who
calleth
on
him
and
we
ask
him
to
make
this
dark
calamity
a
buckler
for
the
body
of
his
saints
and
to
protect
them
thereby
from
sharp
swords
and
piercing
blades
through
affliction
hath
his
light
shone
and
his
praise
been
bright
unceasingly
this
hath
been
his
method
through
past
ages
and
bygone
times
the
people
shall
know
what
today
they
understand
not
when
their
steeds
shall
stumble
their
beds
be
rolled
up
their
pages
swords
be
blunted
and
their
footsteps
slip
i
know
not
how
long
they
shall
ride
the
steed
of
desire
and
wander
erringly
in
the
desert
of
heedlessness
and
error
of
glory
shall
any
glory
endure
or
of
abasement
any
abasement
or
shall
he
endure
who
used
to
stay
himself
on
high
cushions
and
who
attained
in
splendor
the
utmost
limit
no
by
my
lord
the
merciful
all
that
is
thereon
is
transient
and
there
remaineth
only
the
face
of
my
lord
the
mighty
the
beneficent
what
buckler
hath
not
the
arrow
of
destruction
smitten
or
what
pinion
hath
not
the
hand
of
fate
plucked
from
what
fortress
hath
the
messenger
of
death
been
kept
back
when
he
came
what
throne
hath
not
been
broken
or
what
palace
hath
not
been
left
desolate
did
men
but
know
what
pure
wine
of
the
mercy
of
their
lord
the
mighty
the
allknowing
was
beneath
the
seal
they
would
certainly
cast
aside
reproach
and
seek
to
be
satisfied
by
this
servant
but
now
have
they
veiled
me
with
the
veil
of
darkness
which
they
have
woven
with
the
hands
of
doubts
and
fancies
the
white
hand
shall
cleave
an
opening
to
this
sombre
night
on
that
day
the
servants
of
god
shall
say
what
those
caviling
women
said
of
yore
that
there
may
appear
in
the
end
what
began
in
the
beginning
do
they
desire
to
tarry
when
their
foot
is
in
the
stirrup
or
do
they
see
any
return
in
their
going
no
by
the
lord
of
lords
save
in
the
resurrection
on
that
day
men
shall
arise
from
the
tombs
and
shall
be
questioned
concerning
their
riches
happy
that
one
whom
burdens
shall
not
oppress
on
that
day
whereon
the
mountains
shall
pass
away
and
all
shall
appear
for
the
questioning
in
the
presence
of
god
the
exalted
verily
he
is
severe
in
punishing
we
ask
god
to
sanctify
the
hearts
of
certain
of
the
doctors
from
rancor
and
hatred
that
they
may
regard
things
with
eyes
which
closure
overcometh
not
and
to
raise
them
unto
a
station
where
the
world
and
the
lordship
thereof
shall
not
turn
them
aside
from
looking
toward
the
supreme
horizon
and
where
anxiety
for
gaining
a
livelihood
and
providing
household
goods
shall
not
divert
them
from
the
thought
of
that
day
whereon
the
mountains
shall
be
made
like
carpets
though
they
rejoice
at
that
which
hath
befallen
us
of
calamity
there
shall
come
a
day
whereon
they
shall
wail
and
weep
by
my
lord
were
i
given
the
choice
between
the
glory
and
opulence
the
wealth
and
dignity
the
ease
and
luxury
wherein
they
are
and
the
distress
and
affliction
wherein
i
am
i
would
certainly
choose
that
wherein
i
am
today
and
i
would
not
now
exchange
one
atom
of
these
afflictions
for
all
that
hath
been
created
in
the
kingdom
of
production
were
it
not
for
afflictions
in
the
way
of
god
my
continuance
would
have
no
sweetness
for
me
nor
would
my
life
profit
me
let
it
not
be
hidden
from
the
discerning
and
such
as
look
towards
the
chiefest
outlook
that
i
during
the
greater
part
of
my
days
was
as
a
servant
sitting
beneath
a
sword
suspended
by
a
single
hair
who
knoweth
not
when
it
shall
descend
upon
him
whether
it
shall
descend
instantly
or
after
a
while
and
in
all
this
we
give
thanks
to
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
and
we
praise
him
under
all
circumstances
verily
he
is
a
witness
unto
all
things
we
ask
god
to
extend
his
shadow
that
the
unitarians
may
haste
thereto
and
that
the
sincere
may
take
shelter
therein
and
to
bestow
on
these
servants
flowers
from
the
garden
of
his
grace
and
stars
from
the
horizon
of
his
favors
and
to
assist
him
in
that
which
he
liketh
and
approveth
and
to
help
him
unto
that
which
shall
bring
him
near
to
the
dayspring
of
his
most
comely
names
that
he
may
not
shut
his
eyes
to
the
wrong
which
he
seeth
but
may
regard
his
subjects
with
the
eye
of
favor
and
preserve
them
from
violence
and
we
ask
him
exalted
is
he
to
make
thee
a
helper
unto
his
religion
and
a
regarder
of
his
justice
that
thou
mayest
rule
over
his
servants
as
thou
rulest
over
those
of
thy
kindred
and
mayest
choose
for
them
what
thou
wouldest
choose
for
thyself
verily
he
is
the
potent
the
exalted
the
protecting
the
selfsubsistent
now
since
suitable
occasion
hath
arisen
it
hath
been
considered
appropriate
that
some
of
the
precepts
of
bahaullah
which
are
contained
in
tracts
and
epistles
should
also
be
inserted
briefly
in
this
treatise
so
that
the
main
principles
and
practice
and
their
foundations
and
basis
may
become
clear
and
apparent
and
these
texts
have
been
copied
from
numerous
tracts
amongst
them
is
this
consort
with
people
of
all
religions
with
spirituality
and
fragrance
beware
lest
the
zeal
of
ignorance
possess
you
amongst
mankind
all
originated
from
god
and
returneth
unto
him
verily
he
is
the
source
of
creation
and
the
goal
of
the
worlds
and
amongst
them
is
this
ye
are
forbidden
sedition
and
strife
in
the
books
and
epistles
and
herein
i
desire
naught
save
your
exaltation
and
elevation
whereunto
beareth
witness
the
heaven
and
its
stars
the
sun
and
its
radiance
the
trees
and
their
leaves
the
seas
and
their
waves
and
the
earth
and
its
treasures
we
ask
god
to
continue
his
saints
and
strengthen
them
unto
that
which
befitteth
them
in
this
blessed
precious
and
wondrous
station
and
we
ask
him
to
assist
those
who
surround
me
to
act
according
to
that
whereunto
they
have
been
commanded
on
the
part
of
the
supreme
pen
and
amongst
them
is
this
the
fairest
tree
of
knowledge
is
this
sublime
word
ye
are
all
the
fruit
of
one
tree
and
the
leaves
of
one
branch
pride
is
not
for
him
who
loves
his
country
but
for
him
who
loves
the
whole
world
and
amongst
them
is
this
verily
he
who
educateth
his
son
or
one
of
the
sons
of
another
it
is
as
though
he
educated
one
of
my
sons
upon
him
be
the
splendor
of
god
and
his
grace
and
his
mercy
which
preceded
the
worlds
amongst
them
is
this
o
people
of
baha
ye
have
been
and
are
the
dawnings
of
affection
and
the
daysprings
of
divine
grace
defile
not
the
tongue
with
cursing
or
execration
of
anyone
and
guard
the
eye
from
that
which
is
not
seemly
show
forth
that
which
ye
have
if
it
be
accepted
the
object
is
attained
if
not
interference
is
vain
leave
him
to
himself
while
advancing
toward
god
the
protecting
the
selfsubsistent
be
not
a
cause
of
grief
much
less
of
strife
and
sedition
it
is
hoped
that
ye
will
be
nurtured
in
the
shade
of
the
lotetree
of
divine
grace
and
practice
that
which
god
desireth
ye
are
all
leaves
of
one
tree
and
drops
of
one
sea
amongst
them
is
this
the
faith
of
god
and
religion
of
god
hath
been
revealed
and
manifested
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
the
king
of
preexistence
only
for
the
union
and
concord
of
the
dwellers
upon
earth
make
it
not
a
cause
of
discord
and
dissension
the
principal
means
and
chief
instrument
for
bringing
about
the
appearance
and
irradiance
of
the
luminary
of
concord
is
the
religion
of
god
and
the
law
of
the
lord
while
the
growth
of
the
world
the
education
of
the
nations
and
the
peace
and
comfort
of
those
in
all
lands
are
through
the
divine
ordinances
and
decrees
this
is
the
principal
means
for
this
most
great
gift
it
giveth
the
cup
of
life
bestoweth
everlasting
life
and
conferreth
eternal
blessedness
the
chiefs
of
the
earth
especially
the
exemplars
of
divine
justice
must
make
strenuous
efforts
to
guard
this
state
and
to
upraise
and
preserve
it
so
likewise
that
which
is
necessary
is
inquiry
into
the
condition
of
the
people
and
cognizance
of
the
deeds
and
circumstances
of
each
one
of
the
different
classes
we
desire
of
the
exemplars
of
gods
power
namely
of
kings
and
chiefs
that
they
will
make
endeavor
perchance
discord
may
depart
out
of
their
midst
and
the
horizons
may
be
illumined
with
the
light
of
concord
all
must
hold
to
that
which
floweth
from
the
pen
of
reminder
and
practice
it
god
witnesseth
and
all
the
atoms
of
existences
testify
that
we
have
mentioned
that
which
will
be
the
cause
of
the
exaltation
elevation
education
preservation
and
reformation
of
the
dwellers
upon
earth
we
desire
of
god
that
he
will
strengthen
his
servants
that
which
this
oppressed
one
seeketh
of
all
is
justice
and
fairness
let
them
not
be
satisfied
with
listening
let
them
ponder
on
what
hath
become
manifest
from
this
oppressed
one
i
swear
by
the
sun
of
revelation
which
hath
shone
forth
from
the
horizon
of
the
heaven
of
the
kingdom
of
the
merciful
one
that
if
any
other
expositor
or
speaker
had
been
beheld
i
would
not
have
made
myself
an
object
for
the
malevolence
and
the
calumnies
of
mankind
finis
by
these
sentences
a
clue
to
the
principles
ideas
line
of
conduct
behavior
and
intentions
of
this
sect
is
placed
in
the
hand
whereas
if
we
seek
to
become
acquainted
with
the
truth
of
this
matter
through
the
accounts
and
stories
which
are
in
the
mouths
of
men
the
truth
will
be
entirely
concealed
and
hidden
by
reason
of
their
manifold
differences
and
contrariety
it
is
therefore
best
to
discover
the
principles
and
objects
of
this
sect
from
the
contents
of
their
teachings
tracts
and
epistles
there
is
no
authority
nor
are
there
any
proofs
or
texts
superior
to
these
for
this
is
the
foundation
of
foundations
and
the
ultimate
criterion
one
cannot
judge
of
the
generality
by
the
speech
or
action
of
individuals
for
diversity
of
states
is
one
of
the
peculiarities
and
concomitants
of
the
human
race
at
all
events
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
eightyfive
ah
they
transferred
bahaullah
and
all
those
persons
who
were
with
him
from
adrianople
to
the
prison
of
akka
and
mirza
yahya
to
the
fortress
of
famagusta
and
there
they
remained
but
in
persia
after
a
while
sundry
persons
who
were
discerning
in
matters
notable
for
wise
policy
and
aware
and
cognizant
of
the
truth
of
the
earlier
and
later
events
made
representation
before
the
presence
of
his
majesty
the
king
saying
what
has
hitherto
been
reported
related
asserted
and
alleged
concerning
this
sect
in
the
royal
presence
was
either
an
exaggeration
or
else
the
speakers
fabricated
statements
with
a
view
to
their
own
individual
designs
and
the
attainment
of
personal
advantages
if
so
be
that
his
majesty
the
king
will
investigate
matters
in
his
own
noble
person
it
is
believed
that
it
will
become
clear
before
his
presence
that
this
sect
have
no
worldly
object
nor
any
concern
with
political
matters
the
fulcrum
of
their
motion
and
rest
and
the
pivot
of
their
cast
and
conduct
is
restricted
to
spiritual
things
and
confined
to
matters
of
conscience
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
affairs
of
government
nor
any
concern
with
the
powers
of
the
throne
its
principles
are
the
withdrawal
of
veils
the
verification
of
signs
the
education
of
souls
the
reformation
of
characters
the
purification
of
hearts
and
illumination
with
the
gleams
of
enlightenment
that
which
befits
the
kingly
dignity
and
beseems
the
worldordering
diadem
is
this
that
all
subjects
of
every
class
and
creed
should
be
the
objects
of
bounty
and
should
abide
in
the
utmost
tranquility
and
prosperity
under
the
wide
shadow
of
the
kings
justice
for
the
divine
shadow
is
the
refuge
of
all
the
dwellers
upon
earth
and
the
asylum
of
all
mankind
it
is
not
limited
to
one
party
in
particular
the
true
nature
and
real
doctrine
of
this
sect
have
now
become
evident
and
well
known
all
their
writings
and
tracts
have
repeatedly
and
frequently
fallen
into
our
hands
and
are
to
be
found
preserved
in
the
possession
of
the
government
if
they
be
perused
the
actual
truth
and
inward
verity
will
become
clear
and
apparent
these
pages
are
entirely
taken
up
with
prohibitions
of
sedition
recommendations
of
upright
conduct
amongst
mankind
obedience
submission
loyalty
conformity
and
acquisition
of
laudable
qualities
and
encouragements
to
become
endowed
with
praiseworthy
accomplishments
and
characteristics
they
have
absolutely
no
reference
to
political
questions
nor
do
they
treat
of
that
which
could
cause
disturbance
or
sedition
under
these
circumstances
a
just
government
can
find
no
excuse
and
possesses
no
pretext
for
further
persecuting
this
sect
except
a
claim
to
the
right
of
interference
in
thought
and
conscience
which
are
the
private
possessions
of
the
heart
and
soul
and
as
regards
this
matter
there
has
already
been
much
interference
and
countless
efforts
have
been
made
what
blood
has
been
shed
what
heads
have
been
hung
up
thousands
of
persons
have
been
slain
thousands
of
women
and
children
have
become
wanderers
or
captives
many
are
the
buildings
which
have
been
ruined
and
how
many
noble
races
and
families
have
become
headless
and
homeless
yet
naught
has
been
effected
and
no
advantage
has
been
gained
no
remedy
has
been
discovered
for
this
ill
nor
any
easy
salve
for
this
wound
to
insure
freedom
of
conscience
and
tranquility
of
heart
and
soul
is
one
of
the
duties
and
functions
of
government
and
is
in
all
ages
the
cause
of
progress
in
development
and
ascendency
over
other
lands
other
civilized
countries
acquired
not
this
preeminence
nor
attained
unto
these
high
degrees
of
influence
and
power
till
such
time
as
they
put
away
the
strife
of
sects
out
of
their
midst
and
dealt
with
all
classes
according
to
one
standard
all
are
one
people
one
nation
one
species
one
kind
the
common
interest
is
complete
equality
justice
and
equality
amongst
mankind
are
amongst
the
chief
promoters
of
empire
and
the
principal
means
to
the
extension
of
the
skirt
of
conquest
from
whatever
section
of
earths
denizens
signs
of
contentiousness
appear
prompt
punishment
is
required
by
a
just
government
while
any
person
who
girds
up
the
loins
of
endeavor
and
carries
off
the
ball
of
priority
is
deserving
of
royal
favors
and
worthy
of
splendid
gifts
times
are
changed
and
the
need
and
fashion
of
the
world
are
changed
interference
with
creed
and
faith
in
every
country
causes
manifest
detriment
while
justice
and
equal
dealing
towards
all
peoples
on
the
face
of
the
earth
are
the
means
whereby
progress
is
effected
it
is
right
to
exercise
caution
and
care
with
regard
to
political
factions
and
to
be
fearful
and
apprehensive
of
materialist
sects
for
the
subjects
occupying
the
thoughts
of
the
former
are
designs
of
interference
in
political
matters
and
desire
of
ostentation
while
the
actions
and
conduct
of
the
latter
are
subversive
of
safety
and
tranquility
but
this
sect
are
steadfast
in
their
own
path
and
firmly
established
in
conduct
and
faith
they
are
pious
devoted
tenacious
and
consistent
in
such
sort
that
they
freely
lay
down
their
lives
and
after
their
own
way
seek
to
please
god
they
are
strenuous
in
effort
and
earnest
in
endeavor
they
are
the
essence
of
obedience
and
most
patient
in
hardship
and
trouble
they
sacrifice
their
existence
and
raise
no
complaint
or
cry
what
they
utter
is
in
truth
the
secret
longing
of
the
heart
and
what
they
seek
and
pursue
is
by
the
direction
of
a
leader
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
regard
their
principles
and
their
chief
and
not
to
make
a
trivial
thing
a
pretext
now
since
the
conduct
of
the
chief
the
teachings
of
his
epistles
and
the
purport
of
his
writings
are
apparent
and
well
known
the
line
of
action
of
this
sect
is
plain
and
obvious
as
the
sun
of
whatever
was
possible
and
practicable
by
way
of
discouragement
determent
eradication
intimidation
reprehension
slaughter
banishment
and
stripes
there
was
no
lack
yet
nothing
was
thereby
effected
in
other
countries
when
they
perceived
severity
and
persecution
in
such
instances
to
be
identical
with
stimulation
and
incitement
and
saw
that
paying
no
attention
was
more
effectual
they
abated
the
fire
of
revolution
therefore
did
they
universally
proclaim
the
equal
rights
of
all
denominations
and
sounded
the
liberty
of
all
classes
from
east
to
west
this
clamor
and
outcry
this
uproar
and
conflagration
are
the
consequences
of
instigation
temptation
incitement
and
provocation
for
thirty
years
there
has
been
no
rumor
of
disturbance
or
rebellion
nor
any
sign
of
sedition
notwithstanding
the
duplication
of
adherents
and
the
increase
and
multiplication
of
this
body
through
many
admonitions
and
encouragements
to
virtue
this
sect
are
all
in
the
utmost
repose
and
stability
they
have
made
obedience
their
distinctive
trait
and
in
extreme
submissiveness
and
subordination
are
the
loyal
subjects
of
the
king
on
what
lawful
grounds
can
the
government
further
molest
them
or
permit
them
to
be
slighted
besides
this
interference
with
the
consciences
and
beliefs
of
peoples
and
persecution
of
diverse
denominations
of
men
is
an
obstacle
to
the
expansion
of
the
kingdom
an
impediment
to
the
conquest
of
other
countries
an
obstruction
to
multiplication
of
subjects
and
contrary
to
the
established
principles
of
monarchy
in
the
time
when
the
mighty
government
of
persia
did
not
interfere
with
mens
consciences
diverse
sects
entered
in
and
abode
beneath
the
banner
of
the
great
king
and
many
different
peoples
reposed
and
served
under
the
shadow
of
that
mighty
governments
protection
the
extent
of
the
empire
increased
from
day
to
day
the
greater
portion
of
the
continent
of
asia
was
under
the
just
rule
of
its
administration
and
the
majority
of
the
different
religions
and
races
were
represented
amongst
the
subjects
of
him
who
wore
its
crown
but
when
the
custom
of
interference
with
the
creeds
of
all
sects
arose
and
the
principle
of
inquiring
into
mens
thoughts
became
the
fashion
and
practice
the
extensive
dominions
of
the
empire
of
persia
diminished
and
many
provinces
and
vast
territories
passed
out
of
her
hands
until
it
reached
such
a
point
that
the
great
provinces
of
turan
assyria
and
chaldea
were
lost
untilwhat
need
of
prolixitythe
greater
part
of
the
regions
of
khurasan
likewise
passed
out
of
the
control
of
the
government
of
persia
by
reason
of
the
interference
with
matters
of
conscience
and
the
fanaticism
of
its
governors
for
the
cause
of
the
afghan
independency
and
the
revolt
of
the
turcoman
tribes
was
in
truth
this
thing
else
were
they
at
no
time
or
period
separate
from
persia
in
face
of
its
evident
harmfulness
what
necessity
is
there
for
persecuting
the
harmless
but
if
we
desire
to
put
in
force
the
sentence
of
the
doctors
of
religion
no
one
will
escape
fetters
and
chains
and
the
keenness
of
the
sword
for
in
persia
apart
from
this
sect
there
exist
diverse
sects
such
as
the
mutasharris
the
shaykhis
the
sufis
the
nusayris
and
others
each
one
of
whom
regards
the
other
as
infidels
and
accuses
them
of
crime
under
these
circumstances
what
need
that
the
government
should
persecute
this
one
or
that
one
or
disturb
itself
about
the
ideas
and
consciences
of
its
subjects
and
people
all
are
the
subjects
of
the
king
and
are
under
the
shadow
of
the
royal
protection
everyone
who
hears
and
obeys
should
be
undisturbed
and
unmolested
while
everyone
who
is
rebellious
and
disobedient
deserves
punishment
at
the
hands
of
his
majesty
the
king
above
all
the
times
are
completely
changed
while
principles
and
institutions
have
undergone
alteration
in
all
countries
such
actions
hinder
development
and
progress
and
cause
decline
and
deterioration
of
the
violent
agitation
which
has
befallen
the
supports
of
oriental
government
the
chief
cause
and
principal
factor
are
in
truth
these
laws
and
habits
of
interference
while
that
state
the
seat
of
whose
dominion
over
the
atlantic
and
the
baltic
is
in
the
furthest
regions
of
the
north
has
by
reason
of

extensive

is

and
where
the

indies
can
such

save
by

justice
to
all

and

at
all
events
by
means
of
just
laws
freedom
of
conscience
and
uniform
dealing
and
equity
towards
all
nationalities
and
peoples
they
have
actually
brought
under
their
dominion
nearly
all
of
the
inhabited
quarter
of
the
world
and
by
reason
of
these
principles
of
freedom
they
have
added
day
by
day
to
the
strength
power
and
extent
of
their
empire
while
most
of
the
peoples
on
the
face
of
the
earth
celebrate
the
name
of
this
state
for
its
justice
as
regards
religious
zeal
and
true
piety
their
touchstone
and
proof
are
firmness
and
steadfastness
in
noble
qualities
virtues
and
perfections
which
are
the
greatest
blessings
of
the
human
race
but
not
interference
with
the
belief
of
this
one
or
that
one
demolition
of
edifices
and
cutting
off
of
the
human
race
in
the
middle
ages
whereof
the
beginning
was
the
time
of
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
end
the
capture
of
constantinople
at
the
hands
of
the
followers
of
islam
fierce
intolerance
and
molestation
of
far
and
near
arose
in
all
the
countries
of
europe
by
reason
of
the
paramount
influence
of
religious
leaders
the
matter
came
to
such
a
pass
that
the
edifice
of
humanity
seemed
tottering
to
its
fall
and
the
peace
and
comfort
of
chief
and
vassal
king
and
subject
became
hidden
behind
the
veil
of
annihilation
night
and
day
all
parties
were
slaves
to
apprehension
and
disquietude
civilization
was
utterly
destroyed
the
control
and
order
of
countries
was
neglected
the
principles
and
essentials
of
the
happiness
of
the
human
race
were
in
abeyance
the
supports
of
kingly
authority
were
shaken
but
the
influence
and
power
of
the
heads
of
religion
and
of
the
monks
were
in
all
parts
complete
but
when
they
removed
these
differences
persecution
and
bigotries
out
of
their
midst
and
proclaimed
the
equal
rights
of
all
subjects
and
the
liberty
of
mens
consciences
the
lights
of
glory
and
power
arose
and
shone
from
the
horizons
of
that
kingdom
in
such
wise
that
those
countries
made
progress
in
every
direction
and
whereas
the
mightiest
monarchy
of
europe
had
been
servile
to
and
abased
before
the
smallest
government
of
asia
now
the
great
states
of
asia
are
unable
to
oppose
the
small
states
of
europe
these
are
effectual
and
sufficient
proofs
that
the
conscience
of
man
is
sacred
and
to
be
respected
and
that
liberty
thereof
produces
widening
of
ideas
amendment
of
morals
improvement
of
conduct
disclosure
of
the
secrets
of
creation
and
manifestation
of
the
hidden
verities
of
the
contingent
world
moreover
if
interrogation
of
conscience
which
is
one
of
the
private
possessions
of
the
heart
and
the
soul
take
place
in
this
world
what
further
recompense
remains
for
man
in
the
court
of
divine
justice
at
the
day
of
general
resurrection
convictions
and
ideas
are
within
the
scope
of
the
comprehension
of
the
king
of
kings
not
of
kings
and
soul
and
conscience
are
between
the
fingers
of
control
of
the
lord
of
hearts
not
of
his
servants
so
in
the
world
of
existence
two
persons
unanimous
in
all
grades
of
thought
and
all
beliefs
cannot
be
found
the
ways
unto
god
are
as
the
number
of
the
breaths
of
his
creatures
is
a
mysterious
truth
and
to
every
people
we
have
appointed
a
separate
rite
is
one
of
the
subtleties
of
the
quran
if
this
vast
energy
and
precious
time
which
have
been
expended
in
persecuting
other
religions
and
whereby
no
sort
of
result
or
effect
has
been
obtained
had
been
spent
in
strengthening
the
basis
of
the
monarchy
fortifying
the
imperial
throne
making
prosperous
the
realms
of
the
sovereign
and
quickening
the
subjects
of
the
king
ere
now
the
royal
dominions
would
have
become
prosperous
the
seedplot
of
the
people
would
have
been
watered
by
the
bounty
of
princely
justice
and
the
splendor
of
the
kingdom
of
persia
would
be
evident
and
apparent
as
the
true
dawn
throughout
the
horizons
of
the
world
these
questions
and
considerations
at
all
events
certain
persons
have
reported
but
let
us
return
to
our
original
subject
the
royal
personage
was
pleased
to
investigate
the
hidden
secret
in
his
own
noble
person
according
to
the
account
transmitted
it
became
clear
and
obvious
before
the
royal
presence
that
most
of
these
suspicions
arose
from
the
intrigues
of
persons
of
influence
who
were
continually
engaged
in
fabricating
matters
behind
the
veil
of
fancy
and
casting
suspicion
upon
the
community
and
who
to
attain
advantages
for
themselves
and
preserve
their
own
positions
were
wont
to
make
motes
appear
as
globes
and
straws
as
mountains
in
the
mirror
of
their
imagination
for
these
suspicions
there
was
absolutely
no
foundation
or
basis
nor
had
these
assertions
any
proof
or
verisimilitude
what
power
and
ability
have
the
helpless
people
or
what
boldness
and
strength
have
poor
subjects
that
they
should
inflict
injury
or
hurt
on
the
sovereign
might
or
be
able
to
oppose
the
military
forces
of
the
crown
from
that
time
till
now
disturbance
and
sedition
have
been
on
the
wane
in
persia
and
clamor
and
strife
have
ceased
although
still
on
rare
occasions
certain
of
the
official
doctors
do
for
their
own
personal
and
private
advantage
stir
up
the
common
folk
raise
a
hue
and
cry
and
by
their
importunity
and
pertinacity
molest
one
or
two
individuals
of
this
sect
as
happened
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
in
isfahan
for
there
were
amongst
the
inhabitants
of
isfahan
two
brothers
siyyids
of
tabataba
siyyid
hasan
and
siyyid
husayn
celebrated
in
those
parts
for
piety
trustworthiness
and
nobility
men
of
wealth
engaged
in
commerce
behaving
towards
all
men
with
perfect
kindliness
and
courtesy
and
to
all
outward
appearance
no
one
had
observed
in
either
of
these
two
brothers
any
swerving
from
what
was
best
much
less
any
conduct
or
behavior
which
could
deserve
torment
or
punishment
for
as
is
related
they
were
admitted
by
all
preeminent
in
all
praiseworthy
and
laudable
qualities
while
their
deeds
and
actions
were
like
exhortations
and
admonitions
these
had
transacted
business
with
mir
muhammad
husayn
the
imamjumih
of
isfahan
and
when
they
came
to
make
up
their
accounts
it
appeared
that
the
sum
of
eighteen
thousand
tumans
was
due
to
them
they
therefore
broke
off
further
transactions
prepared
a
bond
for
this
sum
and
desired
it
to
be
sealed
this
thing
was
grievous
to
the
imamjumih
so
that
he
came
to
the
stage
of
anger
and
enmity
finding
himself
in
debt
and
having
no
recourse
but
to
pay
he
raised
clamor
and
outcry
saying
these
two
brothers
are
babis
and
deserve
severe
punishment
from
the
king
a
crowd
at
once
attacked
their
house
plundered
and
pillaged
all
their
goods
distressed
and
terrified
their
wives
and
children
and
seized
and
despoiled
all
their
possessions
then
fearing
that
they
might
refer
the
punishment
to
the
step
of
the
kings
throne
and
loose
their
tongues
in
demand
of
redress
he
ie
the
imamjumih
fell
to
thinking
how
to
compass
their
death
and
destroy
them
he
therefore
persuaded
certain
of
the
doctors
to
cooperate
with
him
and
they
pronounced
sentence
of
death
afterwards
they
arrested
those
two
brothers
put
them
in
chains
and
brought
them
before
the
public
assembly
yet
seek
as
they
might
to
fix
on
them
some
accusation
find
some
fault
or
discover
some
pretext
they
were
unable
to
do
so
at
length
they
said
you
must
either
renounce
this
faith
or
else
lay
down
your
heads
beneath
the
sword
of
punishment
although
some
of
those
present
urged
them
saying
say
merely
we
are
not
of
this
sect
and
it
is
sufficient
and
will
be
the
means
of
your
deliverance
and
protection
they
would
by
no
means
consent
but
rather
confirmed
and
declared
it
with
eloquent
speech
and
affecting
utterance
so
that
the
rage
and
violence
of
the
imamjumih
boiled
over
and
not
satisfied
with
killing
and
destroying
them
they
inflicted
sundry
indignities
on
their
bodies
after
death
to
mention
which
is
not
fitting
and
of
which
the
details
are
beyond
the
power
of
speech
indeed
in
such
wise
was
the
blood
of
these
two
brothers
shed
that
even
the
christian
priest
of
julfa
cried
out
lamented
and
wept
on
that
day
and
this
event
befell
after
such
sort
that
everyone
wept
over
the
fate
of
those
two
brothers
for
during
the
whole
period
of
their
life
they
had
never
distressed
the
feelings
even
of
an
ant
while
by
general
report
they
had
in
the
time
of
the
famine
in
persia
spent
all
their
wealth
in
relieving
the
poor
and
distressed
yet
notwithstanding
this
reputation
were
they
slain
with
such
cruelty
in
the
midst
of
the
people
but
now
for
a
long
while
the
justice
of
the
king
has
prevented
and
withheld
and
none
dares
attempt
such
grievous
molestations

prefatory
nature
and
books
about
it
often
during
a
long
and
dusty
walk
in
midsummer
i
have
chanced
suddenly
upon
a
wayside
spring
and
stooping
drank
directly
from
the
bosom
of
mother
earth
filled
with
the
pleasant
recollections
of
such
moments
how
tame
is
all
other
tipple
even
though
the
crystal
is
a
marvel
of
art
with
beady
bubbles
winking
at
the
brim
so
too
i
find
it
with
matters
of
graver
import
i
would
that
no
one
should
aid
me
in
gathering
my
stores
but
with
my
own
hands
i
would
delve
at
the
fountainhead
the
spirit
of
such
an
aim
is
a
spur
to
youth
but
becomes
a
source
of
amusement
rather
than
a
more
serious
matter
in
our
maturer
years
i
am
more
than
willing
now
to
take
nature
at
second
hand
but
is
this
safe
how
far
can
we
trust
another
s
eyes
ears
and
sense
of
touch
and
smell
there
are
critics
scattered
as
thickly
as
motes
in
a
sunbeam
veritable
knowalls
who
shriek
beware
when
nature
is
reported
but
for
all
this
outdoor
books
are
very
tempting
to
a
host
of
people
and
in
the
long
run
educate
rather
than
misinform
that
ever
two
naturalists
should
wholly
agree
after
careful
study
of
an
animal
is
not
probable
there
will
be
the
same
differences
as
exist
between
two
translations
of
the
same
book
what
a
crow
a
mouse
or
a
gorgeous
cluster
of
blooming
lotus
is
to
me
these
will
never
be
to
another
but
because
of
this
do
not
persist
that
your
neighbor
is
blind
deaf
or
stupid
i
recently
had
a
horse
ask
me
to
let
down
the
bars
to
another
it
would
have
been
merely
the
meaningless
fact
that
the
horse
neighed
having
an
outdoor
book
in
hand
when
and
how
should
it
be
read
it
is
no
doubt
very
tempting
to
think
of
a
shady
nook
or
babbling
brook
or
both
in
connection
with
the
latest
outdoor
volume
possibly
as
you
start
out
for
a
quiet
day
you
string
together
a
bit
of
rhyme
concerning
the
book
as
leigh
hunt
did
and
others
have
done
since
it
is
a
common
practice
to
carry
a
book
into
the
fields
but
not
a
logical
one
how
can
a
book
even
one
of
outdoor
topics
compete
with
nature
certainly
if
nature
is
to
the
reader
but
a
convenient
room
a
lighter
and
more
airy
one
than
any
at
home
does
it
not
signify
a
serious
lack
in
the
mind
of
that
person
from
a
notice
of
a
recent
publication
i
clip
the
following
a
capital
book
to
slip
into
one
s
pocket
when
taking
an
outing
if
because
of
its
size
it
could
be
readily
slipped
into
one
s
pocket
then
it
was
a
capital
way
of
getting
rid
of
it
what
sort
of
an
outing
can
one
have
who
reads
all
the
while
is
not
the
cloudflecked
sky
something
more
than
a
ceiling
the
surrounding
hills
more
than
mere
walls
the
grass
and
flowers
more
than
carpet
there
is
one
pleasure
even
greater
than
that
of
reading
and
that
is
being
out
of
doors
to
read
at
such
a
time
seems
to
imply
one
of
two
things
either
that
the
reader
knows
nature
thoroughly
or
is
indifferent
to
such
knowledge
the
former
phenomenon
the
world
has
never
seen
the
latter
to
speak
mildly
deserves
our
pity
to
escape
ridicule
which
is
something
to
insure
happiness
which
is
more
to
avoid
great
dangers
which
is
of
even
greater
importance
one
must
know
something
of
nature
in
one
sense
she
is
our
persistent
foe
she
mantles
with
inviting
cover
of
rank
grass
her
treacherous
quicksands
she
paints
in
tempting
colors
her
most
poisonous
fruits
she
spreads
unheralded
the
insidious
miasma
from
the
meadow
and
the
swamp
but
neither
the
quicksand
the
unwholesome
fruit
nor
noxious
vapors
is
an
unmixed
evil
let
us
take
them
as
they
are
see
them
as
parts
and
parcels
of
a
complete
whole
and
each
hour
of
every
outing
is
an
unclouded
joy
nature
never
excuses
our
ignorance
whatever
one
s
position
in
life
does
a
knowledge
of
nature
prove
unneeded
should
we
not
know
that
potatoes
grow
beneath
the
sod
as
well
as
apples
grow
upon
trees
gather
a
crowd
at
random
on
the
streets
or
corner
a
halfdozen
at
some
social
gathering
and
how
many
can
tell
you
the
lifehistory
of
a
mushroom
or
a
truffle
do
potatoes
grow
upon
bushes
was
asked
not
long
since
this
was
positively
painful
but
worse
things
have
happened
a
young
lady
from
a
city
renowned
for
its
schools
startled
her
country
cousins
by
asking
while
toying
with
an
ear
of
corn
which
end
when
you
plant
do
you
put
in
the
ground
the
blunt
or
the
pointed
one
if
botany
is
impracticable
in
the
curriculum
of
the
public
schools
ought
not
at
least
the
natural
history
of
our
common
articles
of
food
to
be
taught
can
not
such
ignorance
as
this
implied
be
banished
from
the
land
but
i
have
wandered
let
us
come
back
to
books
if
books
even
those
descriptive
of
nature
are
out
of
place
in
the
woods
meadows
or
by
the
brookside
when
should
they
be
read
clearly
when
the
scenes
they
treat
of
are
not
accessible
why
should
we
be
entertained
with
a
description
of
a
bird
or
flower
when
they
are
both
before
us
it
seems
incredible
that
any
one
should
be
better
pleased
with
another
s
impressions
however
cunningly
told
than
with
those
of
his
own
senses
it
is
a
strange
mental
condition
that
can
delight
in
the
story
of
a
bird
and
yet
have
no
desire
to
see
the
creature
to
be
a
witness
to
all
the
marvelous
cunning
that
this
bird
exhibits
few
are
those
among
us
whose
outings
cover
a
lifetime
and
when
the
happy
days
of
freedom
come
to
us
let
books
be
kept
behind
and
with
untrammeled
eyes
and
ears
let
us
drink
in
the
knowledge
that
comes
to
us
at
no
other
time
summer
is
all
too
short
a
season
for
other
occupation
than
enthusiastic
sightseeing
and
soundhearing
long
before
autumn
most
of
us
must
be
back
to
the
busy
town
business
demands
our
workday
hours
and
now
during
the
leisure
of
long
winter
evenings
with
what
delight
one
may
recall
vacationdays
reading
outdoor

the

now

one

a
winter
sunrise
the
waning
moon
was
scarcely
visible
in
the
western
sky
and
not
a
star
shone
overhead
when
i
ventured
out
of
doors
at
the
call
of
the
gathering
crows
these
noisy
scavengers
of
the
river
s
shore
had
evidently
slept
with
one
eye
open
and
at
the
first
faint
glimmering
of
the
dawn
signaled
in
no
uncertain
tones
the
coming
day
across
the
brown
meadows
floated
their
clamorous
cries
and
roused
me
when
my
own
slumber
was
most
profound
but
i
responded
promptly
willing
at
least
if
not
wildly
anxious
to
witness
a
winter
sunrise
i
have
said
the
meadows
were
brown
such
was
their
color
when
i
saw
them
last
but
now
every
wrinkled
blade
of
last
year
s
grass
was
daintily
feathered
with
pearly
frost
a
line
too
of
steelgray
crystals
topped
every
rail
of
the
old
worm
fence
and
capped
the
outreaching
branches
of
the
scattered
trees
the
glint
of
splintered
glass
filled
the
landscape
knowing
the
view
would
there
be
least
obstructed
i
walked
leisurely
to
a
high
knoll
in
the
lower
meadows
leaving
a
curiously
dark
streak
behind
me
where
i
brushed
away
the
frost
as
i
passed
not
a
bird
greeted
me
the
sparrows
and
chickadees
of
yesterday
were
still
asleep
the
crackling
of
brittle
twigs
beneath
my
feet
was
the
only
sound
i
heard
save
of
course
the
blended
voices
of
the
distant
crows
the
brightening
of
the
eastern
sky
proceeded
slowly
cloud
above
cloud
threatened
to
shut
out
the
light
until
the
day
had
well
advanced
while
from
the
river
rose
a
filmy
bank
of
smokelike
fog
that
settled
in
huge
masses
over
the
intervening
marshes
but
still
the
crows
were
clamorous
and
i
had
been
told
that
their
songs
at
sunrise
augured
a
fair
day
so
twixt
hope
and
fear
i
reached
the
high
knoll
in
my
neighbor
s
meadow
it
was
at
the
nick
of
time
without
a
heralding
ray
in
the
whole
horizon
a
flood
of
rosy
light
leaped
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
and
every
cold
gray
crystal
of
the
frost
glowed
with
ruddy
warmth
then
deafening
loud
was
the
din
of
the
foraging
crows
as
though
they
exulted
at
the
fullfillment
of
their
prediction
and
from
that
moment
on
the
day
was
beautiful
and
if
crows
could
be
so
enthusiastic
over
a
bright
winter
day
why
not
other
birds
what
of
that
host
of
arctic
finches
that
tarry
with
us
until
spring
i
listened
in
vain
for
the
foxie
sparrow
s
warble
the
call
of
the
peabody
bird
and
whistling
of
the
purple
finch
these
were
all
here
yesterday
and
making
merry
now
every
one
was
mute
the
ceaseless
cawing
of
the
crows
may
have
drowned
their
voices
but
i
think
not
however
in
other
ways
and
no
less
cheerful
ones
the
vivifying
effect
of
sunrise
was
soon
apparent
everywhere
about
me
my
friends
the
meadow
mice
were
in
their
glory
their
grasswalled
runways
were
roofed
with
ice
and
not
a
breath
of
the
chilly
breeze
that
fretted
the
outer
world
could
reach
them
i
quite
forgot
the
increasing
beauty
of
the
eastern
sky
in
my
eagerness
to
watch
the
mice
i
could
look
down
upon
them
through
the
transparent
roofs
of
their
crystal
palaces
and
wonder
what
might
be
their
errands
every
one
was
in
a
hurry
and
none
stopped
to
nibble
at
a
blade
of
grass
or
tarried
at
a
cluster
of
seedpods
was
it
the
mere
pleasure
of
activity
that
prompted
them
it
was
very
warm
beneath
the
ice
and
far
from
cold
above
it
but
all
the
while
i
might
be
frightening
the
poor
creatures
so
i
withdrew
at
the
thought
to
the
cover
of
a
clump
of
bushes
quiet
then
seemed
partially
restored
and
soon
one
mouse
came
from
an
opening
in
the
roof
where
many
runways
met
it
picked
its
painful
way
over
the
frost
as
though
every
crystal
was
a
pricking
needle
i
moved
and
away
it
darted
but
not
to
tell
its
fellows
another
and
another
came
and
like
the
one
first
seen
they
simply
ran
from
post
to
pillar
and
back
from
pillar
to
post
perhaps
a
weasel
was
on
their
track
but
if
we
commence
surmising
there
will
never
be
an
end
to
it
let
me
declare
dogmatically
these
mice
were
taking
a
sun
bath
and
with
this
thought
leave
them
as
i
looked
about
me
the
crows
again
became
the
most
prominent
feature
of
the
landscape
they
hovered
in
a
loose
flock
over
all
the
meadows
literally
in
thousands
and
as
the
rays
of
the
sun
struck
them
they
too
glistened
as
though
the
frost
crystals
had
incased
their
feathers
higher
and
higher
they
rose
into
the
misty
air
and
soon
dispersed
in
every
direction
but
they
will
gather
again
as
the
day
closes
for
over
the
river
somewhere
in
the
woods
they
have
a
roostingplace
i
have
seen
this
knoll
now
thickly
tenanted
by
mice
black
with
crows
day
after
day
within
a
fortnight
what
then
became
of
the
mice
surely
their
cunning
stood
them
well
in
need
to
escape
these
ravenous
birds
and
yet
they
have
done
so
stupid
as
they
seem
when
studied
individually
these
mice
must
have
a
modicum
of
motherwit
to
thrive
in
spite
of
so
many
odds
against
them
but
now
as
the
day
advanced
the
wooded
bluff
a
mile
away
and
the
willows
on
the
rivershore
gave
evidence
that
not
alone
were
the
crows
and
mice
awake
to
the
beauty
and
warmth
of
a
winter
sunrise
the
feathered
world
was
now
astir
and
music
from
a
hundred
throats
filled
the
crisp
air
there
was
it
is
true
not
that
volume
of
sound
that
greets
the
daybreak
in
june
and
no
one
voice
was
as
tuneful
as
a
thrush
this
mattered
not
the
essential
feature
of
a
pleasant
stroll
evidence
that
i
was
not
alone
was
present
for
i
can
not
keep
company
with
meadow
mice
i
call
it
a
dead
day
when
there
are
no
birds
and
he
who
would
know
what
such
a
day
is
should
be
on
the
marshes
or
the
river
when
not
a
sound
rises
from
the
wild
waste
about
him
i
stood
long
listening
to
the
afaroff
choir
and
then
turning
my
steps
homeward
fancied
i
could
distinguish
the
different
birds
that
now
made
the
woods
fairly
ring
there
was
a
ditch
to
cross
before
reaching
the
hillside
and
right
glad
am
i
that
i
looked
before
leaping
it
for
i
saw
a
lazy
frog
slowly
responding
to
the
increasing
warmth
of
the
sunshine
all
night
long
this
creature
had
been
sleeping
in
a
cosy
nook
a
foot
deep
in
the
soft
mud
which
was
protected
here
from
the
north
and
west
and
has
never
been
known
to
freeze
one
eye
and
a
small
fraction
of
the
frog
s
head
were
visible
but
the
former
was
bright
and
i
was
sure
that
no
accident
had
happened
to
bring
it
even
so
far
above
the
surface
i
stood
very
still
expecting
much
but
it
was
like
watching
the
hourhand
of
a
clock
in
time
the
whole
head
was
exposed
then
the
forelimbs
and
this
for
many
minutes
was
the
extent
of
the
frog
s
activity
i
ventured
finally
to
assist
and
lifting
up
the
clammy
creature
placed
it
on
a
floating
fence
rail
whereon
the
sun
shone
as
in
summer
the
frog
was
happy
its
expression
showed
this
its
pulsing
sides
proved
it
and
could
i
have
heard
it
croak
my
own
satisfaction
would
have
been
complete
but
this
it
would
not
do
but
let
it
be
remembered
the
croaking
can
not
be
forced
either
in
june
or
january
and
the
voices
of
frogs
have
been
heard
frequently
during
the
latter
month
even
when
the
winter
has
been
very
severe
a
typical
january
thaw
has
led
them
to
give
tongue
to
croak
unmistakably
although
in
thinner
tones
than
during
a
summer
s
night
chorus
there
were
hours
yet
before
noon
and
my
little
adventure
with
the
languid
frog
prompted
me
to
explore
the
ditch
in
a
rude
way
all
forms
of
aquatic
life
seemed
as
active
as
in
spring
fish
salamanders
snakes
turtles
and
insects
were
not
only
active
but
alert
and
as
difficult
to
capture
as
i
had
ever
found
them
actual
sluggishness
characterized
the
frogs
only
and
yet
these
creatures
are
supposed
to
be
less
susceptible
to
cold
than
all
the
others
the
truth
is
the
winter
habits
of
every
form
of
life
are
little
known
and
what
impressions
if
any
most
have
upon
the
subject
are
more
or
less
erroneous
we
have
had
no
winter
as
yet
but
the
same
conditions
that
i
found
today
were
true
of
the
ditchdwellers
last
year
and
the
year
before
when
we
had
not
only
winter
but
winter
intensified
i
did
not
enumerate
the
many
birds
aright
as
i
approached
the
hillside
my
attention
was
suddenly
called
from
the
ditch
to
the
greenbrier
thicket
beyond
by
a
familiar
sound
yet
which
now
late
in
january
seemed
quite
out
of
place
if
not
out
of
tune
and
harsh
it
was
the
querulous
cry
of
a
catbird
this
familiar
thrush
is
no
rara
avis
at
such
a
time
although
probably
in
audubon
s
day
few
if
any
remained
in
new
jersey
during
the
winter
no
author
makes
mention
i
believe
of
such
an
occurrence
the
number
seen
each
winter
gradually
increases
and
the
disposition
to
remain
affects
apparently
these
birds
over
a
steadily
extending
area
so
at
least
from
correspondence
i
am
led
to
believe
i
found
but
three
flowers
as
i
neared
my
home
a
dandelion
a
violet
and
a
pale
spring
beauty
but
earlier
in
the
month
a
friend
had
been
more
successful
and
gathered
not
only
those
i
have
named
but
others
doubtless
these
superlatively
early
blossomings
have
to
do
with
the
present
extraordinary
winter
now
more
than
half
gone
but
not
altogether
perhaps
many
a
plant
is
more
vigorous
than
we
suspect
and
stray
flowers
are
hidden
beneath
the
fallen
leaves
more
often
than
we
know
when
in
the
forbidding
gloom
of
a
winter
dawn
i
ventured
out
of
doors
it
was
with
the
anticipation
of
a
cheerless
walk
if
not
fear
of
actual
discomfort
but
the
brilliant
sunrise
promptly
dispelled
all
this
my
fears
giving
way
to
hopes
that
were
more
than
realized
midwinter
minstrelsy
it
is
a
common
impression
i
find
that
when
the
northern
songbirds
come
in
autumn
from
canada
to
the
middle
and
southern
states
they
leave
their
music
behind
them
and
during
their
sojourn
here
they
only
chirp
and
twitter
at
best
and
far
oftener
are
moody
and
silent
this
absurdity
is
not
readily
explained
unless
it
be
that
lovers
of
birds
are
persistently
indoors
from
november
until
may
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
a
keen
cold
frosty
morning
is
rendered
the
more
charming
by
reason
of
the
best
efforts
of
the
winter
wren
purple
finch
or
whitecrowned
sparrow
but
that
not
one
of
them
is
necessarily
mute
because
the
mercury
is
down
to
zero
indeed
temperature
alone
seems
to
have
almost
nothing
to
do
with
the
movements
or
habits
generally
of
our
birds
either
the
resident
or
migratory
species
all
depends
upon
the
foodsupply
and
a
feast
in
winter
is
followed
by
a
merry
heart
as
surely
as
a
successful
wooing
in
may
results
in
ecstatic
song
i
think
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
during
the
present
season
as
yet
winter
only
in
name
there
has
been
really
less
activity
and
disposition
on
the
part
of
all
our
birds
to
sing
than
when
we
have
had
snow
and
ice
in
abundance
i
worked
my
way
recently
through
a
tangled
trackless
bit
of
swamp
and
while
climbing
over
the
prostrate
trunk
of
a
huge
tree
startled
a
winter
wren
as
it
crept
from
beneath
a
smaller
log
near
by
it
seemed
as
astonished
that
i
should
have
ventured
so
far
from
the
open
meadow
as
i
was
to
see
any
bird
less
mopish
than
an
owl
the
wren
stood
contemplating
me
for
at
least
one
minute
a
long
time
for
a
wren
to
remain
in
one
spot
and
then
gave
vent
to
its
astonishment
by
not
a
chirp
but
a
short
series
of
sweet
notes
that
well
repaid
me
for
my
recent
labors
then
darting
into
the
thicket
the
wren
was
gone
but
i
was
not
left
alone
at
the
same
moment
a
troop
of
treesparrows
settled
upon
the
clustered
waterbirches
and
their
united
voices
rose
to
the
dignity
of
a
bird
s
song
such
it
evidently
was
intended
to
be
for
the
chattering
of
birds
when
they
merely
chirp
or
twitter
which
is
but
their
conversation
is
never
so
softly
modulated
but
pitched
in
a
hundred
different
keys
this
became
noticeable
directly
afterward
for
the
birds
scattered
among
the
undergrowth
and
the
short
quick
utterances
that
i
soon
continually
heard
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
two
or
three
notes
which
before
they
had
separated
they
uttered
in
concert
and
as
i
returned
home
while
crossing
a
wide
meadow
where
the
rank
grasses
afforded
excellent
cover
i
found
many
small
brown
birds
that
ran
through
them
as
aimlessly
as
frightened
mice
they
were
titlarks
as
it
proved
none
sang
until
i
was
near
at
hand
when
one
after
the
other
rose
a
short
distance
from
the
ground
flew
a
few
feet
and
uttered
while
on
the
wing
a
sharp
but
belllike
note
that
was
truly
musical
another
and
another
started
up
at
almost
every
step
but
only
to
alight
again
directly
at
times
there
were
four
or
five
in
sight
at
once
and
then
their
united
voices
sounded
sweetly
in
the
still
air
quickening
my
steps
the
flock
finally
rose
in
a
body
and
so
fitful
and
irregular
was
their
progress
had
there
been
a
stiff
breeze
at
the
time
they
might
have
been
mistaken
for
drifting
autumn
leaves
i
need
not
pursue
this
feature
of
winter
bird
life
further
so
far
as
the
migratory
species
are
concerned
but
a
word
with
reference
to
those
birds
which
are
here
throughout
the
year
the
resident
species
the
robin
carolina
wren
songsparrow
and
thistlebird
sing
i
am
sure
with
unabated
ardor
in
spite
of
the
cold
a
miserably
damp
foggy
or
even
windy
day
has
a
depressing
effect
and
at
such
a
time
i
usually
find
the
woods
meadows
and
the
river
shore
quite
silent
unless
indeed
there
be
crows
in
abundance
during
the
last
week
in
january
when
much
of
the
time
there
was
a
chilly
northwest
wind
and
often
a
clouded
sky
the
songsparrows
thronged
the
willow
hedges
and
sang
their
mayday
melodies
i
heard
them
soon
after
sunrise
at
midday
and
once
after
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
it
was
fast
growing
dark
there
is
yet
another
feature
of
bird
music
which
is
characteristic
of
winter
the
singing
of
passing
flocks
when
high
in
the
air
day
after
day
of
late
soon
after
sunrise
a
merry
company
of
bluebirds
fly
over
the
house
and
each
one
sings
as
he
passes
by
toward
sunset
they
return
to
the
cedar
and
pine
woods
across
the
river
and
then
too
they
may
be
heard
their
movements
are
as
regular
as
those
of
the
crows
that
roost
somewhere
in
the
same
neighborhood
i
have
often
failed
to
see
them
they
flew
at
so
great
an
elevation
but
their
song
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
that
of
any
other
bird
nor
are
they
like
the
chats
ventriloquists
somewhere
in
the
upper
regions
they
were
floating
along
and
their
music
drifting
earthward
brightens
the
winter
landscape
until
we
think
of
early
spring
but
the
bluebirds
are
not
always
so
unsociable
there
is
a
rick
of
cornstalks
not
far
away
about
which
i
find
a
pair
almost
daily
and
did
not
the
pestiferous
housesparrows
worry
them
so
much
i
am
sure
they
would
sing
more
frequently
they
appear
to
realize
that
their
songs
may
be
heard
and
so
bring
down
upon
them
an
attack
so
if
they
warble
at
all
it
is
very
softly
as
though
not
quite
discouraged
and
hopeful
of
better
times
they
have
held
their
little
fort
however
since
early
autumn
and
i
am
in
hopes
will
outwit
their
enemies
when
nesting
time
arrives
no
it
is
not
true
that
the
country
is
desolate
even
in
midwinter
i
heard
a
bluebird
sing
during
the
great
storm
of
march
and
since
then
have
been
hopeful
although
for
more
than
one
mile
during
my
recent
outings
comparative
silence
reigned
and
now
what
of
today
the
last
one
of
the
month
i
heard
the
crested
tit
whistling
in
the
faroff
woods
before
the
sun
had
risen
and
not
less
musical
was
the
distant
cawing
of
the
myriad
crows
that
were
just
leaving
their
roost
overhead
in
the
tops
of
the
tall
pines
were
nuthatches
and
chicadees
and
shortly
after
a
host
of
pine
finches
they
were
all
fretting
as
i
fancied
because
the
wide
reaches
of
meadow
near
by
were
still
shut
from
view
but
it
was
not
harsh
scolding
after
all
and
as
the
day
brightened
their
voices
cleared
until
later
when
the
birds
had
scattered
among
the
hedges
they
all
sang
sweetly
for
at
such
a
time
the
ear
is
not
critical
and
even
the
plaint
of
the
nuthatch
is
not
out
of
tune
on
and
on
i
walked
expecting
in
the
wilder
woods
and
about
the
marshy
meadows
to
find
birds
and
birds
many
that
sang
and
others
that
would
interest
by
virtue
of
their
ways
i
confidently
looked
for
the
host
of
winter
finches
and
the
overstaying
herons
but
i
saw
none
heard
none
by
noon
the
whole
country
was
sadly
silent
and
not
even
a
crow
passed
by
yet
the
day
was
perfect
save
a
little
cooler
it
was
typical
indiansummer
weather
plant
life
responded
to
the
inviting
sunshine
and
i
gathered
violets
and
spring
beauty
even
the
saxifrage
shone
through
the
brown
leaves
its
white
buds
almost
unfolded
it
is
in
vain
to
conjecture
what
had
become
of
the
birds
of
the
early
morning
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
i
was
greatly
disappointed
and
had
i
not
been
astir
so
very
early
would
have
been
the
more
sorely
puzzled
as
it
was
the
birds
had
not
utterly
forsaken
us
and
proved
in
their
own
way
and
in
their
own
time
that
midwinter
minstrelsy
is
not
a
myth
a
cold
wave
when
mr
isaac
norris
of
philadelphia
merchant
and
man
of
observation
recorded
the
weather
in
the
vicinity
of
that
city
and
earlier
he
did
not
mention
cold
waves
as
such
but
remarked
that
there
was
greater
irregularity
then
than
formerly
adding
the
significant
statement
at
present
it
is
warm
even
the
very
next
day
after
a
severe
cold
and
sometimes
the
weather
changes
several
times
a
day
whether
since
these
sudden
changes
of
temperature
have
become
more
frequent
or
not
i
have
no
satisfactory
means
of
determining
but
am
inclined
to
think
such
to
be
the
case
but
new
or
old
as
a
meteorological
freak
a
cold
wave
is
worthy
of
the
rambler
s
study
in
spite
of
the
discomforts
sure
to
be
encountered
for
it
necessarily
affects
all
animal
life
that
was
astir
before
it
reached
us
yesterday
there
were
birds
in
the
woods
and
about
the
meadows
even
spiders
had
spread
their
webs
in
the
sunny
glades
and
stray
flies
hummed
in
the
sheltered
hollows
of
the
hill
so
that
thoughts
of
an
early
spring
came
continually
to
the
fore
as
i
watched
and
listened
to
the
busy
life
about
me
myself
reclining
at
full
length
on
a
prostrate
tree
had
there
been
no
intimation
of
the
cold
wave
s
coming
in
the
morning
paper
it
would
have
been
suspected
as
on
its
way
for
all
day
the
barometer
was
suspiciously
low
and
soon
after
sunset
a
faint
moaning
in
the
chimney
corner
and
a
far
shriller
sound
among
the
treetops
suggested
a
coming
change
the
sudden
upleaping
of
sparks
too
from
the
backlog
counts
for
something
for
an
hour
or
more
the
coals
had
been
red
or
purple
and
scarcely
a
flame
however
small
shot
from
the
glowing
mass
then
at
the
whisper
of
the
fretful
wind
suddenly
long
trains
of
brilliant
sparks
flew
upward
and
again
both
the
backlog
and
the
black
foresticks
were
ablaze
doubtless
in
the
good
old
times
this
never
passed
unnoticed
and
every
one
ventured
a
prediction
when
there
was
no
likelihood
of
erring
so
he
who
spake
first
in
the
days
of
our
grandfathers
became
the
greater
weatherprophet
during
the
night
the
cold
wave
came
as
i
write
we
are
having
the
first
icemaking
weather
of
the
season
although
february
is
well
advanced
the
chill
gray
clouds
scarcely
concealed
the
sun
as
it
rose
and
later
when
the
sky
was
clear
a
rosy
blush
tinted
the
drifted
snow
upon
the
fields
what
now
of
the
busy
birds
the
spiders
and
humming
flies
of
yesterday
have
they
folded
their
tents
like
arabs
and
silently
disappeared
facing
the
north
wind
i
pushed
through
brake
and
brier
listening
at
every
step
for
the
chirp
of
a
startled
bird
for
some
time
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
a
living
creature
nor
indeed
did
i
wonder
at
their
absence
at
last
a
solitary
crow
struggled
against
the
fierce
wind
and
uttered
at
times
a
most
melancholy
plaint
it
was
all
but
sufficient
to
send
me
home
and
i
stood
for
a
moment
pitifully
undecided
but
the
crow
i
saw
did
make
some
headway
and
i
took
a
hint
of
it
the
icy
gusts
that
swept
the
hillside
soon
forced
me
however
to
seek
shelter
and
i
crept
for
some
distance
along
the
bed
of
a
deep
dry
ditch
overhung
by
blackberry
canes
and
smilax
here
i
found
a
more
springlike
temperature
and
was
not
surprised
when
from
the
clusters
of
dead
grass
blue
jays
hopped
before
me
they
were
evidently
startled
at
my
appearance
in
their
snug
retreat
but
still
were
not
timid
as
when
in
the
open
woods
i
often
approached
within
a
few
paces
and
they
hid
i
am
sure
in
the
tangled
vines
and
bushes
on
the
banks
of
the
ditch
instead
of
flying
out
into
the
meadow
but
if
jays
there
should
be
other
birds
i
thought
and
i
stopped
again
and
again
to
listen
it
was
the
same
old
story
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
the
roar
of
the
wind
overhead
weary
at
last
with
creeping
through
such
cramped
quarters
i
sat
down
to
rest
at
a
convenient
point
and
never
have
i
been
so
fortunate
in
the
choice
of
an
outlook
it
is
clearly
evident
that
our
resident
birds
and
mammals
soon
know
every
nook
and
corner
of
their
chosen
haunts
and
more
that
they
pass
from
point
to
point
in
accordance
with
fixed
plans
and
do
not
wander
aimlessly
about
if
you
overtake
in
broad
daylight
as
sometimes
happens
any
animal
larger
than
a
mouse
it
is
not
likely
to
be
confused
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
such
indecision
would
invariably
prove
fatal
their
actions
under
such
circumstances
indicate
full
knowledge
of
their
surroundings
and
convince
one
of
this
fact
if
not
true
then
every
surprised
animal
must
take
in
at
a
glance
every
tree
burrow
ditch
and
path
and
select
between
them
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
my
own
observations
lead
me
to
conclude
that
our
mammals
which
are
largely
nocturnal
survey
at
night
the
whole
country
and
know
every
inch
of
the
ground
every
tanglewood
is
to
them
a
city
with
its
main
thoroughfares
and
side
alleys
and
it
is
this
knowledge
that
enables
them
to
outwit
their
foes
within
a
few
days
a
skunk
came
boldly
into
the
yard
in
broad
daylight
defied
the
dog
by
assuming
a
bold
front
and
was
making
for
the
only
near
place
of
safety
within
easy
reach
when
in
the
yard
an
opening
under
a
side
porch
by
mere
accident
only
it
was
run
down
and
killed
this
dreaded
creature
had
evidently
been
belated
and
coming
home
after
sunrise
used
wonderful
tactics
when
it
encountered
the
dog
it
played
with
him
it
ran
this
way
and
that
but
never
far
and
always
faced
the
halftimid
mastiff
it
shook
its
huge
tail
bristled
its
long
fur
snapped
squeaked
and
all
the
while
approached
in
short
stages
the
porch
at
last
seeing
more
than
an
even
chance
of
reaching
it
the
cunning
creature
bolted
and
i
am
almost
sorry
that
it
did
not
escape
so
too
with
our
birds
not
all
of
them
act
upon
foreknowledge
of
a
coming
cold
wave
and
temporarily
migrate
on
the
other
hand
had
they
no
places
of
refuge
the
majority
would
perish
no
bird
could
have
weathered
the
cold
cutting
winds
that
prevailed
last
night
with
the
air
too
at
times
filled
with
stinging
sleet
yet
hunt
the
country
over
after
such
a
night
and
how
seldom
will
you
find
a
dead
bird
lying
upon
the
ground
even
after
such
a
storm
as
the
historic
blizzard
of
a
year
ago
birds
that
had
succumbed
through
exposure
were
comparatively
few
the
fact
that
the
alien
sparrows
in
our
cities
were
destroyed
in
large
numbers
strengthens
my
previous
assertion
for
they
unlike
wild
life
are
largely
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
snug
harbors
such
as
the
country
affords
our
native
birds
and
their
semidomesticated
condition
has
rendered
them
less
provident
and
observing
such
at
least
was
the
tenor
of
my
thoughts
while
resting
in
my
sheltered
outlook
before
many
minutes
had
elapsed
the
expected
chirping
of
winter
finches
was
heard
at
first
in
the
distance
but
directly
almost
overhead
then
everywhere
about
me
a
moment
later
and
a
dozen
were
in
full
view
myself
a
shapeless
mass
upon
a
mossy
log
the
birds
mistook
me
for
a
part
of
it
and
i
had
but
to
look
and
listen
foxie
sparrows
threaded
the
tangled
maze
of
vine
and
cane
singing
a
few
sweet
notes
at
times
as
the
wind
lulled
and
the
warm
sunshine
flooded
the
shelter
with
a
brighter
glow
whitethroats
warbled
in
their
listless
way
and
one
fearless
winter
wren
peered
into
every
cranny
of
the
hollowed
earth
spiderhunting
wherever
the
waters
of
the
last
freshet
had
caverned
the
overhanging
banks
as
it
drew
near
i
almost
held
my
breath
hoping
it
would
venture
to
creep
over
me
once
it
came
very
near
stopped
and
looked
me
squarely
in
the
face
but
without
its
suspicions
being
aroused
probably
i
needed
but
a
few
cobwebs
to
have
brought
it
even
closer
for
long
the
lighthearted
birds
in
joyous
mood
passed
up
and
down
this
hidden
highway
often
within
arm
s
reach
and
not
one
recognized
me
it
was
much
like
being
alone
in
a
strange
city
where
the
feeling
of
desolate
isolation
can
best
be
realized
much
as
i
might
desire
it
i
could
in
no
sense
become
a
part
of
the
happy
world
about
me
here
at
times
is
the
shadow
that
rests
upon
the
rambler
s
path
to
feel
that
at
best
he
is
but
tolerated
and
to
know
that
had
these
happy
creatures
the
power
they
would
drive
him
into
the
bleak
world
beyond
one
interesting
feature
of
bird
life
was
today
very
apparent
never
did
two
or
more
individuals
meet
upon
the
same
twig
but
a
low
scarcely
audible
twitter
was
uttered
i
could
often
see
a
slight
movement
of
the
beak
without
hearing
a
sound
and
notice
a
gentle
tremor
of
the
wings
that
doubtless
meant
much
to
them
but
can
not
be
interpreted
by
us
then
away
they
would
go
following
the
line
of
the
long
ditch
without
grazing
the
tiniest
twig
that
bent
above
them
why
many
a
sparrow
apparently
in
reckless
haste
did
not
come
to
grief
is
indeed
a
puzzle
for
never
i
thought
had
i
found
thorns
so
sharp
so
slender
and
so
thickly
set
but
not
birds
alone
had
sought
shelter
here
the
mice
also
had
been
driven
from
the
windswept
meadows
and
these
ventured
into
the
sunlight
but
were
cautious
to
a
marked
degree
none
came
very
near
and
when
i
was
in
full
view
they
stopped
sat
upon
their
haunches
and
felt
sure
if
i
correctly
read
their
thoughts
that
all
was
not
quite
right
not
one
passed
by
me
their
keen
noses
detected
what
the
proverbially
keen
sight
of
the
birds
had
failed
to
discover
that
i
was
not
a
harmless
bit
of
driftwood
or
did
the
sense
of
hearing
catch
the
sound
of
my
breathing
explain
it
as
one
may
meadowmice
were
never
before
so
knowing
and
i
recall
the
charge
that
i
have
often
made
that
they
are
stupid
so
here
i
sat
for
two
whole
hours
yet
not
aware
that
so
long
a
time
had
elapsed
it
mattered
nothing
that
the
fierce
wind
raged
above
me
that
the
bending
oaks
echoed
its
heartless
boast
i
come
from
the
fields
of
the
frozen
north
o
er
the
waste
of
the
trackless
sea
where
the
winter
sun
looks
wearily
forth
and
yieldeth
his
strength
to
me
this
lessened
not
my
comfort
nor
quickened
my
homeward
steps
wrapping
my
cloak
the
closer
i
recalled
the
day
s
adventures
as
i
withdrew
thinking
how
true
it
was
that
pleasant
surprises
are
ever
in
store
for
the
earnest
rambler
and
many
a
loss
for
him
who
is
fainthearted
it
is
not
well
to
judge
the
world
through
a
window
the
woods
in
winter
when
i
walk
in
the
woods
in
summer
i
think
of
the
trees
as
a
shelter
they
go
to
form
a
protection
alike
against
the
sun
and
passing
shower
and
if
i
turn
from
the
old
cartpath
it
is
but
to
enter
some
oneside
compartment
of
a
great
labyrinth
of
rooms
no
one
tree
calls
for
observation
they
are
as
the
inner
walls
of
a
great
house
and
what
they
surround
alone
commands
attention
it
is
going
out
of
doors
as
much
to
leave
the
thick
woods
as
to
pass
from
your
dwelling
but
now
during
december
s
bright
cheery
winter
days
every
tree
in
these
same
woods
becomes
my
companion
we
are
exposed
to
the
same
sunny
sky
and
as
i
wander
from
one
to
another
each
has
its
pleasant
greeting
for
me
this
has
been
a
lifelong
fancy
of
mine
walk
up
to
a
centuryold
oak
and
how
promptly
it
speaks
to
you
of
giant
strength
and
sturdy
independence
turn
then
to
a
stately
liquidambar
and
you
are
greeted
with
exquisite
grace
i
can
point
out
in
the
old
woods
here
at
home
the
counterparts
of
many
a
man
i
know
the
lonely
wild
apple
on
a
gravelly
knoll
is
as
crabbed
as
my
crusty
neighbor
who
begrudges
me
a
few
flint
arrowheads
i
think
i
should
be
soured
by
wandering
half
a
day
in
a
forest
of
wildapple
trees
there
is
no
such
feeling
when
with
the
oaks
beeches
chestnuts
and
silver
birch
they
recall
no
unfortunates
among
one
s
acquaintance
every
tree
of
them
is
content
with
the
world
as
it
finds
it
and
so
too
am
i
when
surrounded
by
them
the
woods
were
quiet
when
i
entered
not
a
twig
trembled
and
the
dead
leaves
were
too
limp
to
crackle
beneath
my
feet
dainty
frost
crystals
were
plentifully
strown
over
the
dwarfed
bushes
by
the
roadside
and
a
film
of
glittering
ice
with
jagged
sides
reached
out
from
the
banks
of
a
little
brook
near
by
nowhere
did
the
ice
reach
wholly
across
the
stream
and
so
was
the
more
beautiful
by
reason
of
the
inky
waters
that
flowed
sluggishly
beneath
it
where
about
the
roots
of
a
massive
beech
the
brook
had
become
a
little
pool
i
stood
for
many
minutes
alternately
watching
the
waters
that
here
seemed
roused
to
a
semblance
of
activity
and
then
listening
to
the
welcome
cawing
of
the
overflying
crows
brooks
birds
and
trees
your
choice
of
such
good
company
and
yet
there
are
those
who
would
have
gone
mad
here
from
loneliness
for
the
time
i
gave
heed
to
the
brook
wondering
as
usual
what
might
be
beneath
the
surface
and
all
the
while
as
ever
happens
the
creatures
of
the
brook
were
wondering
about
myself
if
one
turns
to
the
textbooks
he
will
find
much
said
of
the
instinct
that
leads
the
lower
forms
of
life
to
seek
a
safe
shelter
as
winter
approaches
the
lower
forms
of
life
in
this
brook
had
no
such
intention
first
i
detected
dainty
little
frogs
the
peeping
hylodes
squatted
on
dead
leaves
and
yellow
pebbles
and
so
spotted
splotched
and
wrinkled
were
they
that
it
took
sharp
eyes
to
find
them
their
idea
of
a
shelter
in
winter
is
from
enemies
and
not
from
the
frosty
air
a
little
warmer
sunshine
today
would
have
moved
them
to
sing
time
and
again
during
november
they
rattled
and
peeped
almost
as
shrilly
as
ever
in
april
and
they
will
again
if
we
are
treated
to
a
green
christmas
the
spirit
of
exploration
seized
me
now
and
i
brushed
the
shallow
waters
with
a
cedar
branch
lazy
mud
minnows
were
whipped
from
their
retreats
and
a
beautiful
red
salamander
that
i
sent
whizzing
through
the
air
wriggled
among
the
brown
leaves
upon
the
ground
it
was
only
after
a
hard
chase
that
i
captured
it
and
holding
it
in
my
hand
until
rested
i
endeavored
to
induce
it
to
squeak
for
it
is
one
of
a
very
few
that
has
a
voice
but
it
was
not
to
be
coaxed
it
suffered
many
indignities
in
silence
and
so
shamed
me
by
its
patience
that
i
gently
placed
it
in
the
brook
soon
black
shining
whirligigs
the
gyrinus
suddenly
appeared
and
a
turtle
as
if
wondering
what
might
be
the
cause
of
the
commotion
thrust
its
head
in
the
air
stared
angrily
at
me
and
returned
to
its
hidden
home
there
was
no
dearth
of
life
in
the
brook
yet
this
is
a
winter
day
the
ground
is
frozen
and
the
rattle
of
wagons
upon
the
highway
penetrates
even
to
this
remote
recess
in
the
deep
woods
as
a
child
soon
tires
of
one
toy
so
i
longed
after
an
hour
s
play
for
a
new
field
and
other
forms
of
life
and
so
much
for
serious
study
as
that
i
might
vary
my
amusement
but
let
not
this
apparent
aimlessness
be
held
unworthy
of
the
rambler
call
it
play
if
you
choose
but
the
incidents
of
such
a
day
come
back
in
bold
relief
when
with
or
without
an
effort
they
are
recalled
i
have
found
it
most
fortunate
that
unconscious
cerebation
is
so
active
when
i
wander
about
toying
as
here
by
the
forest
brook
with
many
forms
of
life
more
than
half
the
acts
of
every
creature
i
meet
are
apparently
meaningless
at
the
moment
of
their
occurrence
but
their
full
significance
is
evident
when
in
thought
i
wander
a
second
time
over
the
same
ground
scarcely
regarded
incidents
come
well
to
the
fore
and
throw
a
flood
of
light
upon
what
lacked
at
the
time
any
evidence
on
the
creature
s
part
of
complicated
thought
herein
i
think
lies
the
secret
of
so
much
disappointment
when
some
people
and
they
are
many
wander
in
the
fields
filled
with
enthusiastic
desire
upon
laying
down
the
teeming
pages
of
thoreau
and
burroughs
they
expect
to
see
with
another
s
eyes
and
appreciate
with
another
s
brain
they
see
a
bird
a
mammal
or
a
host
of
butterflies
and
then
ask
themselves
upon
the
spot
well
what
of
them
the
bare
fact
of
their
presence
is
all
that
the
minds
of
inexperienced
ramblers
encompass
the
wild
life
they
have
met
excites
a
passing
thrill
and
they
give
no
further
heed
to
it
and
it
never
occurs
to
many
to
recall
the
incidents
being
a
bit
disappointed
then
why
give
heed
to
the
subject
later
on
the
contrary
if
at
the
close
of
the
day
in
the
hills
and
hollows
of
the
blazing
wood
upon
the
andirons
if
the
walk
was
in
winter
we
picture
the
scenes
of
the
recent
ramble
these
same
birds
or
mammals
or
whatsoever
else
we
saw
will
be
seen
again
in
a
new
light
why
those
birds
and
not
others
were
where
we
found
them
why
the
fieldmice
or
rabbits
or
a
weasel
were
where
we
saw
them
or
it
will
become
evident
the
various
features
of
every
visited
spot
will
be
remembered
and
the
cheery
blaze
upon
the
hearth
tells
us
as
it
were
the
story
that
could
not
be
read
when
facing
nature
s
open
page
some
of
us
inveterate
ramblers
read
more
than
others
when
in
the
fields
but
no
one
can
afford
to
trust
to
this
alone
to
extract
the
whole
truth
the
past
must
be
recalled
again
and
again
as
i
whiled
away
the
time
with
the
tenants
of
the
brook
so
i
gave
heed
to
every
passing
bird
and
what
a
strange
panorama
as
one
kind
after
another
flitted
by
the
happy
association
of
woods
and
water
here
as
it
attracted
me
drew
them
to
the
spot
yet
no
one
loitered
long
the
busy
brown
treecreeper
traced
the
crannies
of
the
wrinkled
oaks
the
nuthatches
followed
and
their
complaining
squeaks
seemed
expressive
of
disappointment
that
so
little
food
was
to
be
found
was
this
true
were
these
little
birds
really
complaining
it
certainly
seemed
so
but
how
treacherous
is
this
impression
of
seeming
so
too
often
i
fear
the
rambler
is
content
with
it
and
goes
his
way
convinced
that
what
was
vaguely
apparent
was
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
more
nor
less
i
hold
it
probably
true
that
if
every
bird
which
found
itself
too
late
was
disposed
to
complain
there
would
be
a
vast
deal
more
quarreling
than
actually
occurs
how
little
contention
there
is
in
the
birdworld
while
it
is
true
that
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
it
is
equally
so
that
widely
different
species
also
amicably
associate
and
flagrant
is
the
act
that
calls
for
punishment
better
luck
next
time
is
the
homely
proverb
that
actuates
all
nonpredatorial
bird
life
but
the
merit
of
birds
is
their
suggestiveness
promptly
following
the
nuthatches
came
the
everwelcome
songsparrow
it
hopped
with
springtide
liveliness
among
the
dead
leaves
near
the
brook
and
then
flying
to
a
hazel
bush
near
by
it
sang
that
sweet
song
that
not
even
the
mockingbird
ventures
to
repeat
the
woods
vanished
and
the
old
garden
with
its
gooseberry
hedge
was
before
me
i
was
a
wondering
child
again
listening
and
looking
at
the
happy
bird
happy
as
itself
it
is
december
the
day
is
cold
the
trees
are
leafless
the
ground
frozen
but
not
a
thought
of
all
this
had
clouded
my
joy
for
half
a
day
there
is
the
elixir
of
perpetual
summer
even
in
the
woods
in
winter
and
happy
is
he
who
can
find
it
old
almanacs
it
is
a
dilapidated
outbuilding
now
and
the
merest
ghost
of
its
former
self
scarcely
one
of
the
many
marked
features
of
the
old
kitchen
is
left
the
cavernous
fireplace
the
corner
cupboard
the
narrow
box
staircase
the
heavy
double
doors
with
their
long
strap
hinges
the
long
narrow
table
by
the
south
windows
have
all
been
removed
and
sad
too
to
think
that
one
by
one
the
sturdy
farmer
folk
that
lived
in
and
loved
this
now
dark
and
dingy
room
have
all
passed
away
for
me
it
is
the
mecca
to
which
i
most
fondly
turn
when
indulging
in
retrospection
in
and
about
it
were
passed
many
of
those
peculiarly
happy
days
the
recollection
of
which
grows
brighter
as
the
years
roll
by
from
late
autumn
until
spring
when
for
five
months
the
nights
were
long
this
kitchen
was
the
favorite
rendezvous
and
conversation
rather
than
reading
the
popular
amusement
not
that
there
were
no
books
in
the
house
there
were
fifty
volumes
at
least
in
the
old
bookcase
but
i
can
not
recall
one
in
the
hands
of
a
reader
there
are
many
of
them
now
on
my
own
shelves
gibbon
johnson
goldsmith
burns
and
the
journal
of
many
a
quaker
of
colonial
times
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
that
books
were
unpopular
but
rather
that
conversation
was
held
in
higher
esteem
then
certainly
every
neighborhood
had
its
characters
and
their
like
has
not
been
transmitted
to
the
present
generation
i
saw
the
last
of
a
native
folk
who
had
occupied
my
neighborhood
since
now
a
new
people
and
as
different
as
black
from
white
occupy
the
land
but
during
my
early
childhood
my
grandfather
s
help
like
himself
had
always
lived
in
the
neighborhood
they
had
been
boys
together
and
little
wonder
that
when
a
day
s
work
was
done
the
evening
should
have
been
spent
in
reminiscent
talk
the
farmer
was
not
off
to
his
book
at
candlelight
and
the
hands
left
to
their
thoughts
how
glad
now
am
i
that
i
caught
even
in
early
youth
a
glimpse
of
simpler
times
in
one
way
however
the
world
has
not
changed
conversation
continually
turned
upon
the
weather
and
there
was
one
book
to
which
reference
was
often
made
and
quite
frequently
consulted
the
almanac
how
plainly
i
can
see
my
grandfather
adjust
his
heavyrimmed
spectacles
and
turn
to
the
record
of
the
current
month
yes
thee
is
right
abijah
the
moon
changes
in
the
forenoon
then
the
thin
pamphlet
was
hung
again
in
its
place
in
the
chimney
corner
hardheaded
and
alertly
observant
as
were
the
farmers
of
fifty
years
ago
they
all
deferred
to
the
almanac
s
dictum
men
might
say
perhaps
what
they
pleased
but
if
he
who
could
write
an
almanac
ventured
to
predict
who
were
they
to
dispute
it
so
they
thought
and
if
snow
had
been
foretold
for
the
fourth
of
july
they
would
have
explained
the
reason
why
it
did
not
come
and
pity
not
scorn
the
prophet
i
do
not
know
when
the
first
almanac
was
hung
in
the
chimney
corner
but
the
custom
once
started
continued
to
the
end
and
when
the
kitchen
was
dismantled
a
great
pile
of
poor
richards
were
brought
to
light
from
a
dark
hole
in
the
cavernous
corner
cupboard
the
wisdom
crowded
upon
those
torn
and
tattered
pages
seems
to
have
been
lost
and
the
later
generations
were
content
if
i
do
not
misunderstand
them
with
the
commonplaces
and
predictions
to
which
reference
has
been
made
but
with
all
their
unquestioning
reliance
upon
the
almanac
the
men
who
were
daily
out
of
doors
were
prophets
unto
themselves
and
proud
of
the
petty
discoveries
they
claimed
to
have
made
this
it
was
that
spiced
their
conversation
and
made
the
meeting
of
two
or
three
in
a
cozy
kitchen
an
attractive
occurrence
to
young
ears
i
do
not
wonder
that
books
were
ignored
when
every
laboring
man
laid
claim
to
peculiar
knowledge
and
of
course
formulated
weather
proverbs
the
like
of
which
have
never
got
into
print
for
while
the
neighborhood
had
like
all
others
its
common
stock
of
accepted
sayings
not
a
man
for
miles
around
but
had
some
two
or
three
that
he
had
framed
for
his
own
guidance
every
discussion
teemed
with
according
to
joshua
or
jeremiah
s
saying
is
but
every
man
was
largely
a
follower
of
himself
looking
backward
and
studying
my
grandfather
s
help
and
even
my
farmer
neighbors
i
see
in
the
light
of
the
present
that
these
men
were
both
ignorant
and
wise
having
a
rich
store
of
facts
from
which
they
drew
illogical
deductions
apropos
of
this
let
me
add
that
of
a
series
of
sixteen
newspaper
clippings
from
papers
published
in
october
and
november
fifteen
of
them
were
predictions
of
a
winter
of
unusual
severity
in
the
middle
states
the
one
that
maintained
the
coming
of
a
mild
winter
gave
no
reasons
for
such
a
conclusion
but
stated
very
briefly
that
certain
neverfailing
signs
pointed
that
way
it
is
a
pity
that
such
signs
were
not
generally
known
now
that
the
groundgoose
hogbone
theory
has
proved
unreliable
and
so
it
was
a
year
earlier
during
the
autumn
of
i
gathered
by
the
aid
of
several
friends
a
considerable
number
of
newspaper
clippings
concerning
the
character
of
the
coming
winter
most
of
them
predicted
a
very
severe
season
and
a
late
spring
a
few
were
somewhat
more
moderate
in
the
use
of
superlatives
and
one
long
essay
on
the
breastbone
of
the
goose
made
me
shiver
to
read
although
the
day
was
warm
and
in
spite
of
the
assurance
that
each
of
the
phenomenally
cold
periods
would
be
alternated
by
spells
of
falllike
weather
not
one
hit
the
nail
upon
the
head
and
foretold
that
december
and
january
would
be
winter
with
winter
left
out
and
only
today
january
i
find
in
a
local
paper
that
the
muskrats
are
stopping
up
the
entrances
to
their
homes
and
february
will
be
very
cold
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
i
have
just
received
volume
i
of
the
geological
survey
of
new
jersey
in
which
is
a
most
interesting
chapter
on
the
climate
of
this
state
looking
over
a
tabulated
statement
of
the
weather
as
characteristic
of
seasons
i
find
that
we
have
had
six
notably
mild
winters
in
the
past
forty
years
that
of
being
one
of
the
warmest
on
record
armed
with
these
facts
i
hunted
up
our
oldest
neighbor
zephaniah
blank
and
plied
him
with
questions
of
course
as
i
intended
the
conversation
turned
upon
the
weather
as
it
usually
does
and
he
was
very
positive
that
we
had
had
no
such
winter
as
the
present
for
nigh
on
to
thirty
years
the
old
gentleman
could
recollect
the
moderately
warm
winter
of
but
that
of
had
passed
from
his
mind
had
a
reporter
overheard
our
talk
upon
the
subject
the
local
paper
would
doubtless
have
recorded
the
present
as
the
warmest
winter
in
thirty
years
which
is
not
the
fact
besides
we
are
not
yet
out
of
the
woods
for
february
is
often
very
cold
and
march
to
put
the
best
face
upon
it
exceedingly
tricky
considering
that
weather
is
the
most
talkedof
of
subjects
is
it
not
strange
that
upon
no
other
is
so
much
ignorance
displayed
it
has
been
said
that
every
man
is
a
fool
or
a
physician
at
forty
whether
true
or
not
every
sexagenarian
hereabouts
is
a
weather
prophet
and
their
combined
wisdom
is
as
might
be
seen
valueless
every
one
of
these
worthy
men
as
such
is
a
delusion
and
a
snare
but
all
have
faithful
followers
uncle
zephaniah
for
instance
was
very
impatient
to
express
it
mildly
when
i
spoke
of
the
winter
of
the
curl
of
his
lip
the
glitter
of
his
eyes
and
wave
of
his
hand
when
he
remarked
as
if
i
didn
t
know
spoke
volumes
yet
in
spite
of
his
eighty
years
he
did
not
know
there
is
still
another
feature
of
weather
wisdom
if
i
can
call
it
such
that
is
even
more
remarkable
the
proneness
to
forget
the
character
of
a
season
so
soon
after
it
has
passed
it
may
be
hard
to
believe
but
many
a
person
will
stop
to
think
when
the
question
is
put
whether
the
great
march
blizzard
was
last
year
or
the
year
before
unless
such
a
storm
is
coupled
with
some
political
event
or
a
great
disaster
as
fire
or
shipwreck
it
passes
almost
directly
out
of
mind
and
its
magnitude
dwindles
in
comparison
to
some
lesser
event
with
which
the
world
s
history
was
connected
and
the
moral
of
all
this
is
keep
a
diary
swear
only
by
it
and
give
nothing
more
than
a
respectful
hearing
to
unlettered
historians
and
weather
prophets
but
if
the
people
have
changed
the
country
has
not
and
from
the
same
woodland
almanac
from
which
they
drew
their
facts
we
can
draw
ours
can
any
one
read
it
aright
verily
is
not
nature
a
tricksy
author
there
are
the
flowers
that
many
a
town
dweller
thinks
truly
report
the
seasons
pshaw
away
up
in
massachusetts
bradford
torrey
found
over
seventy
plants
in
bloom
during
a
november
afternoon
and
full
well
i
know
of
a
meadow
where
violets
bluets
dandelions
and
bluecurl
can
be
gathered
even
at
christmas
and
all
the
year
round
when
we
have
as
now
a
typical
open
winter
what
of
the
birds
for
of
these
and
blossoms
is
a
naturalist
s
year
made
up
the
woodland
almanac
goes
for
little
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
unless
indeed
you
have
a
trained
ear
for
varying
twitters
bird
music
is
never
lacking
and
i
have
long
held
it
an
open
question
if
we
may
not
spare
the
thrush
when
there
are
foxysparrows
among
the
briers
so
far
as
weather
is
concerned
we
can
not
build
upon
our
birds
and
no
one
of
our
seasons
lacks
them
it
is
the
whim
of
closet
ornithologists
and
petty
critics
to
assert
that
winter
is
comparatively
birdless
but
even
this
is
not
true
there
are
not
so
many
species
but
often
quite
as
many
individuals
and
oftener
more
birdless
indeed
redbirds
meadowlarks
songsparrows
and
blue
jays
at
this
moment
are
making
merry
in
my
garden
notwithstanding
all
this
there
will
always
be
those
who
will
strive
to
the
end
to
decipher
the
woodland
almanac
and
where
is
he
who
claims
not
to
have
solved
its
meaning
it
were
well
if
every
one
spelled
over
a
few
pages
of
it
every
day
it
is
healthy
exercise
fitting
one
to
duties
of
all
kinds
and
never
tending
to
sour
the
temper
of
a
sane
person
if
at
the
close
of
threescore
years
and
ten
he
finds
that
he
is
sure
of
but
the
first
lesson
there
are
four
seasons
weather
wisdom
as
we
all
know
meets
us
at
every
turn
and
while
usually
irritating
occasionally
proves
a
source
of
amusement
some
such
experience
as
the
following
may
have
been
the
fate
of
many
more
than
i
suppose
john
blank
is
one
of
those
unfortunates
who
desire
to
be
thought
a
genius
to
float
with
the
current
is
beneath
his
dignity
uz
gaunt
described
him
well
as
one
who
persists
in
looking
toward
the
west
to
see
the
sun
rise
knowing
my
love
for
the
open
fields
this
wouldbe
genius
has
kindly
treated
me
of
late
to
innumerable
accounts
of
recent
observations
of
beasts
birds
reptiles
and
wild
life
s
less
noble
forms
and
certainly
the
man
has
remarkable
powers
in
one
direction
he
can
misinterpret
admirably
think
of
it
he
exclaimed
excitedly
here
it
is
december
and
i
have
heard
a
frog
croak
it
was
not
a
springtime
croak
of
course
but
a
cry
of
pain
and
i
believe
a
muskrat
dug
it
out
of
its
winter
quarters
and
the
sound
i
heard
was
a
cry
of
pain
it
is
a
wonder
that
he
did
not
hear
the
muskrat
s
chuckle
over
a
good
dinner
also
here
we
have
three
assumptions
that
frogs
never
sing
in
winter
that
they
habitually
hibernate
and
that
muskrats
dig
them
out
of
the
mud
the
aforesaid
john
blank
had
lived
fortyodd
years
on
a
farm
and
did
not
know
that
frogs
voluntarily
sang
or
croaked
during
mild
winter
days
like
many
another
finding
that
it
is
cold
in
december
he
turns
his
back
on
winter
sunshine
here
are
some
statistics
concerning
frogs
in
winter
previous
to
oct
there
had
been
white
frost
some
chilly
days
as
well
as
nights
and
yet
the
frogs
sang
merrily
on
that
date
there
was
frost
snow
and
ice
during
the
following
week
and
then
these
same
frogs
were
again
in
full
chorus
and
later
in
november
as
late
as
the
th
they
rattled
and
piped
not
only
in
the
sheltered
marshes
but
among
the
wilted
stalks
of
lotus
in
an
exposed
upland
field
then
a
long
interim
when
i
was
constantly
in
town
but
at
noon
december
i
heard
them
again
and
on
jan
frogs
of
at
least
two
species
were
croaking
and
too
bees
were
about
snakes
were
sunning
themselves
turtles
crawled
from
the
mud
and
salamanders
squatted
on
dead
oak
leaves
in
the
full
glare
of
an
almost
midsummer
sun
when
john
blank
was
told
of
this
he
looked
his
name
but
he
was
not
disconcerted
did
you
ever
examine
the
marshes
in
winter
i
asked
certainly
not
he
replied
and
added
what
s
to
be
found
in
frozen
mud
cold
water
and
about
dead
grass
more
life
than
you
ever
saw
in
midsummer
was
the
impatient
reply
and
with
this
i
moved
off
blank
maintained
his
reputation
and
declined
to
take
a
hint
did
you
ever
see
wild
violets
at
christmas
he
asked
i
laughed
and
assuming
goodnature
said
come
along
and
started
with
the
conceited
nuisance
to
a
sheltered
meadow
the
grass
was
not
dead
although
christmas
was
at
hand
there
were
even
green
leaves
on
the
sassafras
sprouts
the
water
was
not
cold
although
its
surface
had
been
frozen
the
mud
was
very
soft
clustered
about
the
roots
of
a
noble
tulip
tree
were
claytonias
in
bloom
in
the
moist
meadows
were
paleblue
violets
and
beyond
exposed
to
the
sweep
of
every
chilly
breeze
from
the
west
were
houstonias
and
scattered
here
and
there
were
single
dandelions
this
i
remarked
is
no
unusual
matter
referable
to
midwinter
and
ought
to
be
familiar
to
you
but
you
have
probably
not
looked
in
the
proper
places
for
these
things
and
taking
my
cue
from
dear
old
uz
gaunt
added
don
t
look
in
the
west
to
see
the
sun
rise
then
pleading
an
engagement
with
solitude
i
bade
john
blank
goodmorning
the
landscape
lightened
as
the
bore
disappeared
and
how
an
hour
s
outing
with
nature
soothes
the
irritation
of
an
unwelcome
interview
if
i
were
an
editor
i
would
have
a
cage
of
frogs
with
a
bit
of
green
moss
and
a
pool
of
water
like
that
now
at
my
elbow
to
this
i
could
turn
for
mental
refreshment
the
moment
the
retiring
intruder
faced
the
door
of
the
sanctum
there
is
nothing
so
reviving
as
to
contemplate
a
frog
or
better
yet
a
treetoad
here
is
one
from
florida
that
takes
the
world
philosophically
when
it
is
too
cool
on
the
shady
side
of
his
home
he
creeps
to
the
sunny
side
and
as
the
sun
will
not
stand
still
the
toad
moves
with
it
this
seems
too
trivial
to
mention
but
really
is
not
there
are
people
in
my
neighborhood
who
growl
because
the
sun
does
not
shine
through
the
north
windows
and
more
than
one
old
farmer
who
persists
in
shivering
in
the
wagonhouse
under
protest
of
course
while
the
woodshed
is
warm
and
sunny
there
is
a
chance
for
every
man
born
in
the
world
but
this
same
world
is
not
to
be
molded
to
every
crank
s
convenience
even
my
treetoad
knows
that
a
fly
may
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
glass
for
him
although
it
took
months
of
vain
bumping
of
his
precious
head
before
the
idea
reached
his
brain
and
even
now
he
sometimes
forgets
the
lesson
so
painfully
learned
on
the
other
hand
there
is
little
reason
to
believe
that
john
blank
will
look
in
the
sunny
meadows
next
year
for
belated
blossoms
if
he
finds
one
by
accident
in
a
corner
of
a
cold
upland
field
it
will
be
heralded
as
a
great
discovery
there
is
another
treetoad
in
the
frogpen
that
is
a
happy
philosopher
of
late
either
the
food
offered
is
not
the
proper
sort
or
the
creature
habitually
fasts
at
this
time
of
year
which
is
not
improbable
be
this
as
it
may
there
is
no
giving
way
to
despondency
because
of
an
empty
stomach
and
when
his
companions
are
taking
noonday
naps
or
recalling
the
outer
world
that
once
they
knew
this
little
fellow
from
the
door
of
his
mossy
cave
or
perched
upon
a
dead
twig
near
by
sings
merrily
there
are
doubtless
some
who
would
be
stupid
enough
to
declare
it
the
cry
of
despair
but
there
is
no
trace
of
trouble
in
the
sound
no
tremulous
quaver
as
though
fraught
with
grief
it
is
the
clear
joyous
exultation
of
supreme
content
as
we
hear
it
in
the
woods
during
bright
october
days
again
perhaps
those
gifted
with
an
ear
for
music
would
call
the
treetoad
s
song
a
squeak
this
matters
not
for
when
that
treetoad
pipes
his
single
note
i
take
an
outing
my
study
walls
vanish
the
hillside
and
meadow
the
winding
creek
rolling
field
and
shady
orchard
are
again
as
of
old
the
playground
of
my
rambling
life
a
quaker
christmas
the
winters
seemed
colder
whether
they
were
or
not
when
i
was
a
boy
and
some
thirty
years
ago
there
was
one
christmas
week
when
it
seemed
as
if
the
glacial
period
had
suddenly
returned
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
and
thick
blueblack
ice
on
the
creeks
and
flooded
meadows
one
had
not
to
take
a
circuitous
route
to
reach
whatever
point
he
wished
and
this
to
the
boys
of
the
neighborhood
made
the
outdoor
world
more
attractive
not
an
old
hollow
tree
even
in
the
treacherous
swamps
but
could
now
be
reached
and
so
the
home
of
every
owl
coon
or
opossum
was
at
every
boy
s
mercy
what
then
if
it
were
cold
boots
and
overcoat
were
equal
to
every
need
and
the
wide
and
wild
world
was
before
us
there
was
a
skeleton
in
my
closet
nevertheless
christmas
was
approaching
but
never
a
sign
of
it
within
the
walls
of
the
old
farmhouse
for
years
it
had
come
and
gone
with
scarcely
a
mention
made
of
the
fact
and
now
having
heard
something
of
holiday
festivities
from
city
cousins
i
vowed
i
would
revolutionize
the
family
custom
in
one
respect
but
how
a
hundred
plans
came
as
if
by
magic
but
each
was
handicapped
by
impracticability
a
condition
of
affairs
that
is
very
common
to
most
men
s
maturer
years
it
must
be
a
secret
of
course
the
opposition
would
prove
formidable
indeed
if
the
matter
were
openly
discussed
never
a
christmas
had
been
celebrated
for
a
full
century
in
the
old
house
and
why
now
but
i
was
determined
and
so
it
came
about
that
i
had
a
merry
christmas
it
was
a
simple
matter
after
all
and
how
often
it
happens
that
after
days
of
puzzling
over
the
impossible
an
easy
solution
of
a
difficulty
comes
at
the
proper
moment
when
it
was
time
to
act
all
was
plain
enough
on
one
plea
or
another
i
went
from
house
to
house
as
if
the
call
was
by
mere
accident
and
made
known
my
wishes
to
a
judicious
member
of
each
family
visited
all
agreed
to
broach
the
subject
and
so
it
resulted
that
two
or
more
members
of
five
families
each
group
in
blissful
ignorance
of
his
neighbor
s
movements
determined
to
spend
the
day
with
my
grandfather
it
was
the
first
surprise
party
in
that
staid
quaker
neighborhood
and
never
before
so
merry
a
christmas
of
course
the
originator
was
all
innocence
but
the
puzzled
expression
on
his
grandfather
s
face
and
the
perplexity
of
the
womenfolk
were
fun
indeed
to
him
there
s
company
coming
i
remarked
as
a
carriage
turned
in
the
lane
sure
enough
remarked
my
aunt
who
turning
to
her
sister
added
and
there
is
almost
nothing
for
dinner
i
grinned
before
the
first
carriage
drove
up
to
the
house
a
second
was
in
sight
and
the
third
was
not
far
behind
truly
remarked
neighbor
a
to
neighbor
b
we
did
not
expect
to
meet
thee
here
we
ve
been
intending
to
drive
over
for
some
time
but
the
work
at
home
prevented
and
that
is
what
i
was
about
to
remark
the
same
impulse
has
moved
us
both
a
certain
small
boy
smiled
this
is
quite
a
christmas
celebration
the
somewhat
bewildered
host
replied
and
no
sooner
had
the
sound
of
his
voice
died
away
than
neighbor
c
was
announced
and
neighbors
d
and
e
followed
in
his
wake
i
lingered
to
hear
the
result
but
did
not
dare
show
myself
my
face
was
very
red
for
poor
sedate
grandfather
was
stuttering
really
truly
this
is
treally
ruly
i
heard
no
more
but
made
a
dash
for
the
back
yard
unlucky
dash
i
collided
with
my
portly
aunt
and
both
sprawled
upon
the
entry
floor
the
company
came
streaming
from
the
parlor
but
what
came
of
it
i
never
learned
i
was
up
and
away
before
the
mystery
was
solved
a
rest
on
the
far
side
of
the
barn
finally
restored
me
joy
and
fear
made
it
a
merry
and
mad
christmas
both
but
the
point
was
gained
the
monotony
of
winter
farmlife
was
broken
very
much
broken
in
fact
for
now
the
tables
were
turned
and
voices
were
calling
for
me
some
in
persuasive
some
in
authoritative
tones
at
last
i
responded
and
oh
what
relief
when
the
one
thing
needed
was
to
run
down
chickens
how
many
i
quietly
asked
a
dozen
it
was
an
unfortunate
question
a
glitter
full
of
meaning
flashed
in
the
eyes
of
my
portly
aunt
she
held
me
responsible
for
the
day
s
excitement
and
extra
labor
and
i
knew
it
but
i
grinned
whenever
i
caught
glimpses
of
the
gathered
neighbors
who
could
not
cease
to
wonder
over
the
strange
coincidence
dinner
was
served
in
due
time
it
took
two
tables
to
seat
the
guests
and
the
old
kitchen
was
full
for
once
all
went
well
until
the
portly
lady
who
still
smarted
from
her
fall
asked
of
me
what
all
this
meant
what
does
what
mean
i
asked
in
reply
that
all
these
friends
should
happen
here
today
how
should
i
know
i
asked
thee
does
know
all
about
it
the
old
lady
insisted
and
so
a
confession
was
forced
what
else
could
i
do
twenty
curious
faces
were
centered
upon
me
and
the
truth
came
out
never
mind
never
mind
chimed
in
my
good
grandfather
at
the
proper
moment
i
was
sure
a
committee
was
about
to
take
me
to
task
for
some
offense
and
as
i
have
come
off
so
well
so
shall
he
that
boy
will
make
something
some
of
these
days
remarked
one
longheaded
man
but
alas
his
usual
good
judgment
failed
for
once
that
boy
so
far
as
he
is
aware
has
not
made
much
since
then
much
worth
the
making
but
has
no
end
of
blunders
who
cares
it
was
my
first
jolly
christmas
and
a
complete
success
and
would
that
the
same
season
could
once
again
be
jolly
a
new
place
to
loaf
one
must
plow
deeply
nowadays
to
unearth
novelty
the
world
has
been
written
up
and
that
which
we
now
read
is
but
the
echo
of
some
wellnigh
forgotten
author
many
will
be
quick
to
question
this
and
battle
for
their
originality
but
a
few
days
of
honest
search
on
their
part
among
really
old
books
will
bring
them
to
confusion
it
is
with
living
writers
as
with
the
oldest
inhabitants
who
declare
they
never
knew
such
weather
they
had
better
not
face
statistics
blooming
orchards
in
january
are
on
record
and
february
roses
gladdened
our
greatgrandmothers
is
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
i
had
been
asking
of
myself
as
i
daily
tramped
about
the
farm
or
on
rainy
days
ruminated
in
the
attic
in
a
forest
of
discarded
furniture
the
outlook
for
a
while
was
certainly
discouraging
and
then
suddenly
the
haymow
came
to
mind
as
a
boy
i
loved
the
haymow
how
is
it
now
in
my
maturer
years
spurred
by
the
impulse
of
so
bright
a
thought
i
went
to
the
stable
and
with
oldtimed
suppleness
clomb
the
straight
ladder
what
memories
of
summer
days
in
the
meadows
rushed
in
with
the
odor
of
the
heapedup
hay
a
fancy
perhaps
but
even
the
sweetscented
vernal
grass
that
yearly
adds
its
charm
to
a
single
corner
of
one
field
seemed
stored
in
the
dark
loft
it
matters
not
that
corner
with
its
wealth
of
bright
blossoms
the
glittering
sunshine
of
may
s
perfect
mornings
the
song
of
nesting
thrushes
and
the
rosethroated
grosbeak
s
matchless
song
were
plainly
seen
and
heard
it
mattered
not
that
it
was
january
instead
of
june
and
the
shrill
north
wind
whispered
its
wellnigh
forgotten
warnings
summer
reigned
in
the
haymow
the
noontide
glare
that
webbed
the
dark
with
trembling
threads
of
light
aided
my
fancy
and
i
reveled
in
daydreams
that
was
a
painful
pleasure
when
the
past
was
measured
and
forty
years
marked
off
the
distance
between
my
first
visit
and
the
present
would
life
have
appeared
as
rosyhued
could
i
have
looked
as
far
forward
as
unto
today
perhaps
not
and
what
of
the
retrospective
glances
that
dimly
discern
the
timid
child
floundering
then
in
the
halffilled
mow
with
what
wonder
were
the
darting
swallows
marked
as
they
sped
to
their
nests
upon
the
rafters
and
then
fled
through
a
gaping
chink
to
the
outer
world
what
mystery
shrouded
the
hastening
mice
that
ran
across
the
mow
s
wide
windowsill
squeaked
as
they
met
and
hurried
on
their
way
why
would
they
not
stop
and
speak
to
the
little
child
even
then
birds
and
mice
gave
rise
to
strange
and
painful
thoughts
for
why
indeed
should
they
fear
the
child
that
longed
to
be
their
playmate
that
fancy
has
not
fled
unto
this
day
i
love
them
now
as
then
and
no
longer
wondering
why
they
fear
man
regret
the
fact
almost
as
keenly
as
in
days
gone
by
and
later
when
a
sturdy
lad
but
lazy
what
a
favorite
hidingplace
when
there
were
distasteful
tasks
to
be
shirked
the
rattle
of
a
loose
shingle
today
became
the
familiar
calling
of
my
name
when
errands
were
to
be
run
when
the
hated
churn
was
ready
wood
to
be
cut
or
burdens
to
be
carried
but
like
all
else
that
this
world
offers
the
haymow
was
not
perfection
i
paid
dearly
for
my
thoughtlessness
more
than
once
there
was
much
evidence
of
a
busy
day
about
the
house
some
thirty
years
ago
and
at
breakfast
i
imagined
that
i
would
be
in
demand
but
to
even
think
of
work
upon
such
a
perfect
day
for
idling
was
painful
and
as
usual
i
soon
disappeared
but
nature
was
perverse
not
a
familiar
nook
about
the
farm
responded
as
it
usually
did
even
the
trees
were
so
wrapped
in
their
own
affairs
as
to
turn
the
cold
shoulder
everything
went
wrong
and
hours
before
noon
i
longed
to
be
called
i
listened
for
some
familiar
voice
or
the
regulation
toottoot
of
the
dinnerhorn
the
old
roosters
about
the
barn
crowed
in
a
bantering
way
as
if
calling
me
the
foolish
boy
that
i
was
it
was
irritating
beyond
endurance
and
so
with
the
usual
unreason
of
piqued
youth
i
crept
into
the
haymow
and
while
smarting
from
selfinflicted
pain
fell
asleep
hours
passed
and
then
starting
from
a
nightmare
dream
i
went
sullenly
to
the
house
every
one
smiled
as
i
entered
what
was
the
matter
every
one
was
silent
but
the
secret
could
not
be
kept
a
picnic
party
had
called
for
me
it
is
so
seldom
thee
hears
me
remarked
my
aunt
that
i
did
not
think
it
worth
my
while
to
call
thee
today
and
then
every
one
smiled
exasperatingly
no
dinner
no
picnic
no
appetite
for
supper
but
my
eyes
were
opened
it
is
the
same
haymow
as
forty
years
ago
when
first
i
saw
it
the
same
as
eighty
years
ago
when
my
father
watched
it
building
and
made
it
his
playground
if
not
a
lazy
lad
s
refuge
here
is
the
same
loose
floor
that
needs
a
thick
mat
of
hay
to
render
it
safe
to
walk
over
and
in
one
sense
the
same
dusty
festoons
of
cobwebs
clinging
to
every
corner
while
the
roof
as
of
old
is
starred
with
mudwasps
nests
and
dotted
with
the
swallows
masonry
my
father
s
playground
did
he
too
i
wondered
often
linger
here
thinking
much
the
same
thoughts
and
planning
his
life
s
battles
while
idly
resting
on
the
hay
it
is
not
upon
record
nor
need
be
but
the
old
haymow
bears
testimony
to
his
onetime
presence
here
flinging
open
the
heavy
shutter
of
the
south
window
i
glanced
at
the
shining
oaken
sill
and
frame
both
were
covered
with
rudely
carved
letters
initials
of
many
a
lad
long
since
grown
to
manhood
and
not
one
of
them
now
living
how
closely
i
was
linked
to
a
longgone
past
in
the
bright
sunshine
of
this
january
day
there
was
no
trace
of
winter
in
the
landscape
from
my
outlook
i
saw
nothing
of
the
familiar
fields
and
distant
river
so
dear
to
my
own
boyhood
but
that
wilder
valley
and
more
rugged
fields
that
were
the
pet
theme
of
my
father
s
stories
when
he
charmed
his
hearers
telling
of
his
youth
how
tame
is
the
present
when
compared
with
what
has
been
what
though
the
world
has
wonderfully
advanced
there
is
not
for
me
for
one
and
i
voice
many
another
aught
in
the
present
or
aught
that
imagination
conjures
up
as
the
possible
future
that
can
charm
as
does
the
sweet
calling
back
of
days
gone
by
round
about
a
spring
in
winter
we
dwellers
in
the
northern
hemisphere
naturally
think
of
winter
as
cold
and
shudder
at
the
idea
of
plunging
into
the
water
at
this
season
the
common
demand
is
if
cold
must
be
endured
let
it
at
least
be
rid
of
moisture
but
all
animals
are
not
of
this
way
of
thinking
to
avoid
the
cutting
blasts
of
the
north
wind
the
stinging
sleet
the
pelting
hail
and
driving
snow
many
a
creature
boldly
plunges
in
or
hovers
about
the
sparkling
waters
of
every
bubbling
spring
the
reason
is
at
such
spots
there
is
a
uniform
and
not
low
temperature
the
impression
is
wellnigh
universal
that
the
great
majority
of
animals
other
than
a
few
hardy
birds
are
asleep
from
autumn
until
spring
that
they
are
hibernating
as
it
is
called
it
is
quite
true
when
we
walk
across
an
exposed
field
or
follow
a
woodpath
over
some
high
hill
such
an
impression
will
not
be
disturbed
by
anything
that
we
see
or
hear
but
these
are
not
the
only
routes
open
to
us
stroll
along
the
river
shore
even
when
it
is
blocked
with
ice
and
in
the
little
ponds
of
open
water
you
will
be
pretty
sure
to
see
abundant
forms
of
life
but
better
yet
stray
over
the
meadows
where
in
more
senses
than
one
perpetual
summer
reigns
break
the
thick
ice
if
necessary
that
shuts
from
view
the
shallow
pool
scoop
up
the
dead
pond
weeds
that
mat
the
soft
mud
below
and
see
how
every
bit
of
it
teems
with
curious
life
the
brilliant
dragonflies
that
darted
so
angrily
about
you
last
summer
dropped
their
eggs
here
in
the
water
and
these
hatching
produced
creatures
so
widely
different
from
their
parents
that
few
people
suspect
any
kinship
veritable
dragons
on
a
small
scale
they
are
none
the
less
active
because
ice
and
snow
have
shut
out
the
sunlight
with
their
terrible
jaws
they
tear
to
fragments
in
a
moment
every
insect
within
their
reach
like
the
dragonflies
better
known
perhaps
as
devil
s
darningneedles
there
are
many
other
insects
that
likewise
spend
their
early
days
in
the
meadow
pools
and
as
the
collector
will
find
every
scoopful
of
mud
and
leaves
will
be
tenanted
by
a
range
of
forms
some
grotesque
others
graceful
and
all
of
abounding
interest
these
curious
creatures
have
not
their
little
world
to
themselves
there
are
many
fishes
continually
plowing
up
the
mud
with
their
gristly
snouts
and
ready
to
swallow
every
protesting
wriggler
that
dares
show
itself
in
spite
of
the
nipping
jaws
whether
the
slim
and
slippery
salamanders
commonly
called
lizards
do
the
same
i
do
not
know
but
they
tunnel
the
mud
and
burrow
under
every
heap
of
watersoaked
leaves
and
are
so
active
be
the
weather
what
it
may
that
some
nourishment
must
be
taken
and
there
are
frogs
not
one
of
them
disposed
to
exertion
perhaps
but
none
the
less
able
to
leap
or
burrow
headlong
in
the
yielding
mud
the
instant
they
suspect
danger
during
the
present
winter
i
have
even
heard
them
faintly
croaking
at
midday
but
this
of
course
is
quite
unusual
during
january
not
a
turtle
need
be
looked
for
sunning
itself
however
warm
may
be
the
weather
but
like
the
other
creatures
i
have
named
they
are
not
asleep
in
a
shallow
basin
lined
with
the
cleanest
of
white
sand
through
which
bubbled
an
intermitting
stream
of
sparkling
water
i
recently
surprised
a
mudturtle
poking
anxiously
about
evidently
in
search
of
food
the
creature
had
a
lean
and
anxious
look
and
its
bright
eyes
meant
mischief
as
it
proved
when
i
reached
forward
to
pick
it
up
i
was
bitten
after
a
fashion
and
therefore
delighted
for
i
had
never
before
known
these
turtles
to
be
snapping
and
a
discovery
however
insignificant
is
truly
delightful
active
life
then
in
many
of
its
varied
forms
can
be
found
during
the
winter
in
the
mud
sand
and
water
of
almost
every
spring
and
this
fact
very
naturally
has
its
influence
round
about
the
spot
there
is
no
small
winter
bird
sparrow
titmouse
wren
or
creeper
that
evidently
prefers
the
immediate
surroundings
of
a
spring
to
all
other
spots
but
every
one
of
twenty
or
more
delights
to
make
daily
visits
to
such
a
locality
and
the
sight
of
the
green
growths
that
crowd
the
water
s
edge
prompts
them
all
to
greater
cheerfulness
i
have
thought
than
when
treading
the
mazes
of
upland
thickets
or
scanning
the
dreary
outlook
of
a
snowclad
field
but
yesterday
more
like
june
than
january
it
is
true
i
stood
by
a
little
spring
that
welled
up
from
among
the
roots
of
an
old
maple
to
watch
the
movements
of
a
minnow
that
had
strayed
from
the
creek
near
by
while
there
a
wee
nuthatch
came
darting
down
from
the
trees
and
perched
upon
a
projecting
root
scarcely
an
inch
above
the
water
it
sat
for
a
moment
like
a
fairy
kingfisher
and
then
plunged
into
the
shallow
depths
with
all
the
grace
of
an
accomplished
diver
more
than
this
as
it
shook
the
glittering
drops
from
its
feathers
upon
emerging
it
sang
sweetly
this
unlookedfor
conclusion
of
its
bathing
frolic
was
the
more
remarkable
as
the
ordinary
utterance
of
the
bird
is
anything
but
musical
there
are
large
birds
also
that
frequent
the
springs
habitually
in
winter
and
the
fact
of
their
presence
is
of
itself
evidence
that
other
active
animal
life
must
also
abound
i
refer
to
herons
bitterns
and
i
may
add
crows
the
former
two
subsist
almost
exclusively
upon
frogs
and
fish
while
the
latter
are
content
with
anything
not
absolutely
indigestible
how
vividly
i
can
recall
my
astonishment
when
stooping
once
to
drink
from
a
bubbling
spring
at
the
base
of
the
river
bluff
a
dark
shadow
passed
over
me
and
i
sprang
with
such
a
sudden
motion
to
my
feet
that
i
lost
my
balance
a
great
blue
heron
unheeding
my
presence
or
ignoring
it
was
slowly
settling
down
to
the
very
spot
where
i
stood
and
had
i
remained
quiet
it
would
have
perched
upon
me
i
believe
as
it
was
it
gave
an
impatient
flirt
to
its
whole
body
showing
annoyance
and
not
fear
and
flew
slowly
down
the
river
before
i
had
wholly
regained
my
composure
and
had
time
to
step
aside
the
huge
bird
returned
and
at
once
took
its
stand
in
the
shallow
water
as
silent
motionless
erect
as
a
sentinel
is
supposed
to
be
this
was
many
years
ago
and
i
have
seldom
failed
to
see
them
sometimes
many
together
winter
after
winter
since
the
moody
bittern
on
the
other
hand
is
much
more
disposed
to
migrate
in
autumn
but
at
least
a
single
one
is
likely
to
be
found
on
sheltered
hillsides
particularly
where
there
are
springs
with
marshy
areas
surrounding
them
i
have
learned
this
recently
of
these
birds
and
either
have
overlooked
them
in
years
past
or
it
is
a
new
departure
for
them
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
latter
should
be
true
our
familiar
catbird
is
losing
its
migratory
instinct
very
rapidly
judging
from
the
numbers
that
winter
in
the
valley
of
the
delaware
river
i
have
seen
several
recently
and
every
one
of
them
was
in
a
greenbrier
thicket
and
feeding
on
the
berries
of
this
troublesome
vine
but
if
there
were
no
green
things
in
or
about
the
springs
in
winter
they
would
be
cheerless
spots
after
all
in
spite
of
the
many
forms
of
animal
life
that
we
have
seen
frequent
them
the
fact
that
it
is
winter
would
constantly
intrude
if
the
water
sparkled
only
among
dead
leaves
happily
this
is
not
the
case
at
every
spring
i
saw
and
there
were
many
of
them
during
a
recent
ramble
there
was
an
abundance
of
chickweed
bitterdock
corydalis
and
a
species
of
forgetmenot
sometimes
one
or
two
of
these
only
and
more
often
all
of
them
none
in
bloom
but
all
as
fresh
and
bright
as
ever
a
plant
in
june
then
too
in
advance
of
the
plant
proper
we
find
the
matured
bloom
of
the
skunkcabbage
would
that
it
had
as
pretty
a
name
as
the
plant
deserves
with
its
sheathlike
covering
bronze
crimson
golden
and
light
green
brightening
many
a
dingy
spot
where
dead
leaves
have
been
heaped
by
the
winds
all
winter
long
these
fresh
growths
cause
us
to
forget
that
the
general
outlook
is
so
dreary
and
give
to
the
presence
of
the
abundant
animal
life
a
naturalness
that
would
otherwise
be
wanting
and
not
only
about
the
springs
but
in
them
often
choking
the
channels
until
little
lakes
are
formed
are
found
many
plants
that
know
no
summer
of
growth
and
then
a
long
interval
of
rest
the
conditions
of
the
season
are
too
nearly
alike
and
while
in
winter
there
is
less
increase
growth
never
entirely
ceases
and
certainly
the
bright
green
of
the
delicate
foliage
is
never
dulled
anacharis
or
waterweed
i
find
in
profusion
at
all
the
larger
springs
if
not
then
callitriche
or
waterstarwort
the
latter
is
as
delicate
as
the
finer
ferns
and
often
conceals
much
of
the
water
in
which
it
grows
as
it
has
both
floating
and
submerged
leaves
in
both
these
plants
fish
frogs
and
salamanders
and
large
aquatic
insects
congregate
and
are
so
effectually
hidden
that
when
standing
on
the
side
of
the
spring
basin
a
person
is
not
likely
to
see
any
living
thing
and
if
the
spirit
of
investigation
does
not
move
him
he
will
go
away
thinking
animal
life
is
hibernating
for
so
indeed
it
is
set
down
in
many
books
but
it
does
not
always
do
to
plunge
the
hand
in
among
the
weeds
and
so
try
to
land
whatever
may
be
tangled
in
the
mass
you
pull
ashore
some
of
the
insects
resent
such
interference
by
biting
severely
the
waterboatmen
or
notonectæ
for
instance
and
they
have
the
advantage
of
seeing
all
that
is
going
on
in
the
world
about
them
for
they
swim
upon
their
backs
a
delicate
and
beautifully
marked
sunfish
that
is
silvery
white
with
inky
black
bands
across
it
is
common
in
the
delaware
tidewater
meadows
and
is
found
nowhere
else
recently
in
a
spring
pool
where
the
flow
of
water
was
almost
stopped
by
aquatic
mosses
hypnum
and
fontinalis
i
found
nearly
a
hundred
of
these
fish
gathered
in
a
little
space
all
were
active
and
so
vigorous
that
an
abundant
food
supply
can
be
presupposed
but
i
did
not
bring
the
microscope
to
bear
upon
this
question
and
it
is
upon
minute
forms
of
life
such
as
would
be
readily
overlooked
by
the
casual
observer
that
they
subsist
but
as
is
everywhere
the
case
these
fish
are
not
free
from
molestation
although
to
the
onlooker
they
seem
to
be
dwelling
in
a
paradise
there
is
a
huge
insect
murderous
as
a
tiger
that
singles
them
out
i
have
thought
from
the
hosts
of
more
commonplace
species
which
we
can
easily
spare
it
is
known
as
a
belostoma
and
has
not
so
far
as
i
can
learn
any
common
name
if
they
were
better
known
they
probably
would
have
a
dozen
they
are
wide
and
flatbodied
aquatic
insects
of
more
or
less
ovate
outline
furnished
with
powerful
flattened
swimming
legs
and
the
front
ones
are
fitted
for
seizing
and
holding
tightly
the
victims
upon
which
they
pounce
when
i
found
the
timid
banded
sunfish
huddled
together
in
the
water
moss
i
thought
of
the
savage
belostoma
and
hunted
for
them
none
seemed
to
be
lurking
in
the
moss
but
just
beyond
in
an
open
space
where
twigs
had
drifted
and
dead
leaves
lay
about
i
found
two
of
them
and
i
doubt
not
they
were
lying
in
wait
knowing
where
the
fish
then
were
and
that
sooner
or
later
some
would
pass
that
way
to
determine
by
means
of
crude
experiments
how
far
a
waterbug
has
intelligence
is
a
difficult
if
not
impracticable
undertaking
but
i
can
assure
the
reader
that
the
many
i
have
watched
in
aquaria
seemed
to
be
very
cunning
and
constantly
planning
how
they
might
surprise
the
fish
for
these
on
the
other
hand
knew
the
danger
of
their
presence
and
shunned
them
in
every
possible
way
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
i
think
that
aquaria
have
fallen
into
disrepute
they
are
not
as
has
been
said
failures
but
if
the
labor
of
their
care
can
not
be
undertaken
let
him
who
would
know
more
of
common
aquatic
life
not
fail
to
occasionally
ramble
round
about
the
springs
in
winter
a
bayside
outing
a
cool
gray
mist
overspread
the
wide
reach
of
meadows
and
shut
from
view
the
still
wider
reach
of
water
beyond
the
clouds
were
sullen
and
with
each
gusty
sweep
of
sharp
east
wind
were
dashes
of
chilling
rain
the
outlook
was
dismal
the
more
so
that
my
companions
and
myself
had
journeyed
scores
of
miles
to
reach
the
pleasantville
meadows
perhaps
the
village
itself
was
pleasant
but
now
its
suburbs
were
forbidding
let
me
misquote
euripides
what
the
morning
is
to
be
human
wisdom
never
learns
so
it
proved
the
east
wind
was
soon
tempered
to
three
shorn
lambs
the
sun
peeped
out
upon
us
from
time
to
time
and
long
before
noon
nature
was
smiling
and
contentment
reigned
that
which
most
impressed
me
as
i
neared
the
water
was
the
painful
silence
that
prevailed
over
all
the
scene
not
a
sound
save
that
of
one
s
own
footsteps
was
to
be
heard
the
impression
of
an
absolutely
deserted
country
of
a
region
that
had
been
swept
by
a
pestilence
fatal
even
to
insect
life
took
strong
hold
of
me
but
only
for
a
moment
presently
up
from
the
tufts
of
tall
grass
rose
on
every
side
whistling
meadowlarks
filling
the
air
at
once
with
sweet
sounds
how
my
heart
leaped
my
cheeks
tingled
with
what
eagerness
i
strove
to
catch
their
every
note
for
dear
to
me
now
as
when
a
boy
the
world
daily
opened
up
a
new
scene
of
delights
is
that
old
evernew
refrain
of
the
meadowlark
i
see
you
you
can
t
see
me
but
i
did
see
them
to
the
few
scattered
stunted
trees
they
flew
and
perching
at
the
very
tops
were
sharply
limned
against
the
palegray
sky
did
i
exert
some
subtle
influence
over
them
whether
or
not
they
soon
returned
and
from
hidden
byways
in
the
rank
grass
sang
again
and
again
to
cheer
me
while
at
work
for
not
as
a
rambler
merely
but
to
labor
diligently
had
i
come
so
far
separated
from
the
bay
by
a
narrow
strip
of
meadow
rises
a
little
hillock
that
tall
weeds
would
have
hidden
this
was
one
of
our
objective
points
the
other
was
an
adjoining
sandridge
over
the
former
we
proposed
to
search
for
whatsoever
the
indians
had
left
behind
into
the
latter
we
proposed
to
dig
believing
some
of
these
people
had
been
buried
there
all
this
we
did
the
little
hillock
was
a
shellheap
or
kitchen
refuseheap
as
they
are
called
by
european
archæologists
probably
nothing
tells
so
plainly
the
story
of
the
past
as
do
these
great
gatherings
of
burned
and
broken
shells
so
recent
was
every
firemark
so
fresh
the
bits
of
charcoal
so
sharp
the
fragments
of
roasted
shells
it
would
not
have
startled
the
relichunters
had
the
indians
filed
past
on
their
way
to
the
adjoining
fishing
grounds
and
yet
when
critically
examined
this
particular
spot
had
evidently
been
long
deserted
careful
and
longprotracted
search
failed
to
bring
to
view
any
trace
of
other
than
most
primitive
indian
handiwork
one
patient
searcher
in
fact
had
to
content
himself
with
a
few
flint
flakes
and
the
tiniest
bits
of
rude
pottery
while
another
hunter
was
more
fortunate
and
drew
from
the
side
of
a
deep
and
narrow
path
a
pretty
quartz
knife
and
later
two
slender
shapely
arrowheads
were
found
a
beggarly
show
perhaps
but
what
if
our
hands
were
not
busy
picking
up
relics
our
fancies
were
up
and
doing
we
had
evidences
and
to
spare
that
a
primitive
people
had
once
dwelt
here
and
imagination
supplied
all
deficiencies
as
to
the
matter
of
when
and
why
and
of
the
manner
of
their
simple
lives
such
ever
is
the
charm
of
an
outing
like
this
one
has
to
deal
so
continually
with
stern
facts
in
everyday
life
that
fancy
is
the
better
company
when
out
for
a
stroll
nor
need
we
deceive
ourselves
a
bit
of
burned
clay
in
hand
means
the
primitive
potter
in
the
near
foreground
given
a
single
flake
of
stone
and
the
knife
spear
arrow
and
all
their
belongings
are
in
the
hands
of
men
who
stand
out
boldly
before
us
fancy
within
bounds
is
the
twinsister
of
fact
but
mischief
brews
when
she
oversteps
the
mark
an
hour
with
potsherds
is
monotonous
one
longs
for
some
more
shapely
trace
of
human
handiwork
but
among
heaps
of
broken
and
burned
shells
these
are
not
frequent
herein
the
kitchenmiddens
of
the
new
jersey
coast
differ
as
a
rule
from
the
former
village
sites
in
the
river
valleys
it
would
appear
that
the
indian
s
life
as
a
coastdweller
was
simplicity
itself
it
meant
the
mere
gathering
of
food
from
the
shallow
water
no
contrivances
were
called
for
so
no
specialized
tools
were
left
behind
and
in
their
annual
pilgrimages
to
the
coast
the
inland
people
either
took
but
little
with
them
or
were
very
careful
to
carry
back
everything
they
had
brought
no
wonder
then
we
grow
restive
when
a
richer
harvest
is
promised
by
the
mere
leaping
of
a
fence
there
in
a
grassy
field
it
was
reported
indians
had
been
buried
and
how
exciting
it
is
to
know
that
a
skeleton
may
be
brought
to
light
by
the
mere
turning
of
the
sod
it
has
been
cruelly
said
that
he
who
removes
from
the
ground
a
recently
buried
body
is
a
ghoul
but
if
we
wait
until
the
flesh
has
decayed
then
the
collector
of
dry
bones
becomes
an
archæologist
it
is
not
a
fair
statement
but
whether
true
or
not
we
gave
it
no
heed
but
proceeded
to
dig
scanning
each
spadeful
of
dirt
for
traces
of
bones
we
soon
found
them
and
all
was
excitement
little
by
little
whole
bones
were
exposed
to
view
and
following
these
up
with
the
greatest
care
that
first
of
prizes
to
an
archæologist
a
skull
was
secured
later
a
second
and
a
third
were
found
our
day
was
full
no
not
quite
full
we
knew
that
often
a
bowl
trinkets
and
a
weapon
or
two
were
buried
with
the
body
but
nothing
of
the
kind
was
found
it
was
a
matter
of
dry
bones
only
unless
we
except
the
one
instance
where
the
upper
shell
of
a
large
turtle
rested
on
one
of
the
skulls
this
was
a
cap
that
would
scarcely
prove
comfortable
to
a
living
person
although
not
without
the
merit
of
being
quite
waterproof
the
longest
summer
s
day
is
all
too
short
for
such
eventful
outings
so
little
wonder
that
the
early
setting
of
the
sun
in
february
prompted
our
discontent
who
was
ever
satisfied
in
this
world
he
is
a
halfhearted
rambler
at
best
that
loves
to
quit
such
work
but
the
night
came
down
upon
us
nevertheless
silence
brooded
over
the
broad
meadows
and
the
larks
that
had
cheered
us
until
sunset
ceased
to
sing
could
there
have
been
a
happier
combination
meadowlarks
and
indian
relics
aye
even
the
bones
of
the
indians
themselves
to
say
nothing
of
a
soft
seabreeze
and
a
clear
sky
laden
with
valued
spoils
we
at
last
reluctantly
drew
near
the
village
and
would
that
it
had
been
wrapped
in
egyptian
darkness
how
the
aged
villagers
scowled
at
us
as
we
passed
by
the
lame
the
halt
the
blind
all
came
hobbling
to
the
front
windows
of
their
homes
and
hurled
silent
imprecations
after
us
what
a
sad
ending
to
our
happy
day
and
why
forsooth
in
our
innocent
zeal
we
had
disturbed
the
bones
of
a
few
indian
fishermen
that
for
centuries
had
been
resting
in
perfect
peace
we
the
irate
villagers
claimed
being
in
full
possession
of
good
health
could
withstand
the
fury
of
the
outraged
spirits
of
departed
redskins
but
not
so
the
afflicted
villagers
every
rheumatic
crone
averred
that
her
pains
had
grown
to
agony
since
we
broke
the
sod
invisible
arrows
had
whizzed
by
their
ears
and
more
than
one
sufferer
had
been
struck
as
the
red
marks
upon
their
persons
proved
vengeance
had
gone
astray
and
sorely
pressed
the
innocent
while
the
guilty
walked
without
shame
through
the
long
village
street
this
was
indeed
adding
insult
to
injury
speaking
for
myself
did
i
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
impatience
i
should
have
been
vexed
as
it
was
the
day
deserved
to
be
recorded
in
red
letters
as
a
lover
of
quiet
country
strolls
i
had
been
happy
beyond
measure
but
the
way
of
the
archæologist
it
would
seem
is
beset
with
thorns
free
for
the
day
free
for
the
day
i
scarce
need
tell
the
rest
an
aimless
youth
again
and
nature
s
guest
if
magic
lurks
in
any
four
words
of
the
queen
s
english
it
is
to
be
looked
for
here
free
for
the
day
neither
in
books
nor
out
of
them
have
i
met
with
a
phrase
more
full
of
meaning
one
more
comprehensively
suggestive
to
me
eight
weeks
in
the
noisy
city
had
seemed
almost
a
year
and
at
last
came
a
pause
in
my
occupation
and
a
day
to
myself
no
decision
could
be
reached
in
a
reasonable
time
by
calmly
thinking
the
matter
over
so
closing
my
eyes
i
spun
myself
on
one
heel
determined
to
walk
a
good
ten
miles
in
whatever
direction
i
faced
when
my
whirling
body
came
to
rest
fortune
favored
me
for
i
found
myself
looking
directly
toward
the
river
this
put
an
end
to
my
walking
ten
miles
in
a
bee
line
for
the
river
was
not
one
mile
distant
and
except
at
a
distant
point
could
not
be
crossed
with
a
light
heart
i
made
for
the
river
and
reaching
the
shore
sat
in
a
cozy
nook
where
driftwood
had
conveniently
lodged
walking
is
capital
sport
at
all
times
but
a
comfortable
outlook
never
comes
amiss
and
resting
at
the
end
of
one
mile
is
as
natural
as
at
the
end
of
a
dozen
thoreau
speaks
of
looking
seaward
while
at
cape
cod
and
having
all
america
behind
him
i
took
my
cue
from
him
and
looking
only
down
stream
and
not
far
beyond
saw
only
the
rippling
waters
every
ripple
carried
its
atom
of
the
town
dust
from
my
eyes
and
in
an
hour
i
saw
the
world
again
with
clear
vision
something
of
the
old
self
thrilled
my
veins
but
still
i
was
loath
to
leave
so
sweet
a
spot
i
had
no
promise
of
better
things
and
though
early
february
the
wild
words
of
an
ancient
chronicler
came
to
mind
wrote
a
mendacious
englishman
in
of
this
river
the
delaware
that
it
was
scituate
in
the
best
and
same
temper
as
italy
and
goes
on
to
say
it
is
freed
from
the
extreme
cold
and
barrennesse
of
the
one
new
england
and
heat
and
aguish
marshes
of
the
other
virginia
all
of
which
is
a
to
put
it
mildly
mistake
and
then
the
romancer
adds
the
delaware
valley
is
like
lombardy
and
partaketh
of
the
healthiest
aire
and
most
excellent
commodities
of
europe
then
follows
a
bit
of
nonsense
about
the
wild
beasts
and
agricultural
capabilities
why
could
not
those
old
travelers
be
truthful
there
is
not
one
but
deals
in
absurdities
and
it
would
appear
that
they
rounded
off
every
paragraph
with
a
flight
of
the
imagination
if
his
account
be
true
reindeer
and
moose
as
well
as
elk
and
deer
tramped
these
river
shores
but
three
centuries
ago
and
the
buffalo
roamed
over
the
crosswicks
meadows
this
is
extremely
improbable
moose
and
reindeer
bones
have
been
found
it
is
true
and
even
traces
of
the
muskox
but
all
goes
to
show
that
it
was
far
longer
ago
than
three
centuries
that
there
are
traces
too
of
man
found
associated
with
them
goes
for
nothing
such
association
does
not
bring
the
now
arctic
animals
down
to
a
recent
date
in
this
river
valley
but
places
man
in
an
indefinitely
long
ago
if
there
is
any
one
fact
well
established
it
is
the
antiquity
of
man
in
america
and
those
who
even
in
scientific
journals
say
the
evidences
so
far
are
not
trustworthy
and
all
that
utter
greater
absurdities
than
the
old
chronicler
i
have
quoted
a
word
more
if
the
author
quoted
had
in
mind
such
a
winter
as
this
perhaps
he
can
not
be
held
as
intentionally
wrong
as
to
the
climate
but
why
need
he
have
exaggerated
as
if
the
round
of
the
seasons
in
jersey
could
be
better
when
they
are
as
they
should
be
the
truth
two
hundred
and
odd
years
ago
would
not
have
frightened
a
wouldbe
settler
but
such
a
winter
as
this
might
the
present
meteorological
flummux
which
plays
the
fool
with
all
animate
nature
is
what
the
oldtime
indians
called
niskelan
ugly
weather
and
they
gave
it
the
proper
name
but
hang
the
whole
crew
of
historians
and
scientists
this
is
my
holiday
the
water
is
very
blue
today
very
ripply
and
flaked
here
and
there
with
a
dainty
bit
of
foam
this
is
running
water
at
its
best
it
smells
sweetest
now
and
what
an
odor
that
is
which
rises
from
a
broad
river
the
essence
of
the
mountains
many
a
mile
away
the
ooze
of
the
blacksoiled
meadows
over
which
i
have
just
passed
the
dead
leaves
and
brushwood
and
too
the
grand
old
trees
that
line
the
river
s
shore
all
give
up
some
subtle
perfume
which
mingling
over
the
river
is
wafted
to
the
shore
it
intoxicates
every
breath
indrawn
thrills
the
nerves
and
cleanses
the
citysoiled
fibers
of
our
being
but
let
no
more
be
said
as
i
stood
straight
as
a
signallight
upon
the
shore
my
eye
caught
a
strange
mound
of
bleached
driftwood
in
the
distance
and
curiosity
at
once
drew
me
toward
it
a
recently
drowned
cow
that
dogs
had
torn
such
possible
drawbacks
warn
one
against
enthusiasm
as
to
country
odors
as
for
myself
i
walked
down
stream
thinking
new
thoughts
having
an
odd
fish
in
sight
when
by
the
river
s
side
i
am
never
lonely
odd
fish
are
too
plentiful
in
town
never
a
glut
of
them
the
proper
sort
in
the
water
the
average
minnow
is
an
endless
source
of
amusement
its
rough
and
tumble
existence
is
encouraging
to
striving
mortals
the
minnow
s
ingenuity
is
hourly
taxed
to
escape
danger
yet
never
have
i
seen
one
in
despair
today
was
a
redletter
one
in
this
respect
off
in
a
shallow
pool
not
two
yards
square
was
a
huge
humpbacked
minnow
its
spine
was
as
twisted
as
a
corkscrew
and
its
locomotion
as
erratic
as
lightning
how
could
such
a
fish
secure
its
prey
was
the
question
that
puzzled
me
and
failing
to
hit
upon
a
solution
i
tried
to
capture
the
fish
for
my
aquarium
when
one
has
neither
net
line
nor
other
device
fishing
is
uncertain
except
with
the
professional
liars
i
tried
scooping
with
my
hands
and
have
only
to
relate
as
a
result
that
the
humpbacked
minnow
appeared
to
make
a
springboard
of
its
tail
and
leap
over
my
hands
with
the
grace
and
ease
of
a
professional
acrobat
after
several
attempts
on
my
part
to
circumvent
the
minnow
it
suddenly
disappeared
i
looked
in
vain
for
it
all
through
the
little
pool
it
had
gone
at
last
i
stepped
back
to
turn
to
new
scenes
when
the
humpbacked
minnow
leaped
from
a
pebble
on
the
water
s
edge
with
about
the
agility
of
a
frog
of
course
this
will
go
the
way
of
all
fish
stories
but
i
do
not
mind
telling
it
for
all
that
it
is
the
unexpected
that
happens
a
remark
by
the
way
that
dates
b
c
when
the
rambler
has
no
particular
quest
in
mind
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
birds
were
in
existence
when
a
large
one
ran
along
the
pebbly
beach
not
more
than
a
rod
before
me
it
was
a
kingrail
with
the
thoughtlessness
characteristic
of
a
half
fool
i
hurled
a
stone
after
it
with
the
usual
result
of
frightening
it
and
so
losing
a
golden
opportunity
to
observe
a
rather
rare
bird
at
a
most
unusual
season
why
will
people
be
such
ninnies
if
a
companion
had
been
with
me
and
attempted
this
i
would
have
prevented
him
yet
nine
times
in
ten
i
give
way
to
the
unfortunate
impulse
to
capture
if
not
destroy
the
rarer
creatures
i
meet
had
i
been
born
without
arms
i
would
by
this
time
have
become
a
naturalist
this
tendency
is
due
without
doubt
to
our
nonhuman
ancestry
but
will
we
never
outgrow
it
the
kingrail
is
a
noble
bird
and
a
few
haunt
the
marshes
all
summer
long
nesting
where
the
tall
grass
is
too
rank
and
tangled
even
to
tempt
a
restless
cow
perhaps
they
have
in
mind
the
danger
of
meddlesome
mankind
and
dwell
in
such
spots
accordingly
taking
the
whole
range
of
bird
life
into
consideration
it
certainly
would
appear
that
birds
give
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
such
matters
and
before
leaving
the
subject
i
will
add
that
to
be
intelligible
in
discussing
birds
ways
one
must
assume
that
they
have
minds
akin
to
ours
and
this
leads
to
the
suspicion
on
the
part
of
some
and
conviction
in
my
own
case
that
the
birds
mind
and
that
of
man
are
too
closely
akin
to
warrant
much
distinction
birds
then
as
usual
trooped
to
the
fore
as
i
rambled
down
the
river
i
saw
nothing
else
yet
not
a
bird
was
in
view
the
old
histories
came
to
mind
and
closed
my
eyes
to
other
than
an
inner
vision
greate
stores
of
swannes
geese
and
ducks
and
huge
cranes
both
blue
and
white
is
it
not
exasperating
to
think
of
the
change
wrought
in
two
centuries
a
milewide
river
and
banks
of
oldtime
wildness
still
remaining
yet
not
a
feather
rests
upon
the
one
or
shadow
of
a
walking
bird
falls
upon
the
other
far
and
near
up
and
down
and
high
overhead
i
scan
the
country
for
a
glimpse
of
some
one
bird
but
in
vain
the
crows
nowadays
have
the
river
to
themselves
and
none
of
these
were
about
today
the
day
has
been
a
marked
one
for
its
emptiness
tracing
the
river
s
shore
for
miles
ought
to
yield
rich
results
but
here
at
my
journey
s
end
i
am
emptyhanded
what
little
i
have
seen
has
but
soured
my
temper
it
is
most
unwise
to
be
ever
mourning
over
the
unrecoverable
past
but
how
can
one
avoid
it
such
a
walk
productive
of
nothing
worth
recording
may
not
i
hope
be
in
vain
it
at
least
provokes
me
to
say
can
not
wild
life
or
what
little
remains
of
it
be
effectually
protected
can
not
swans
geese
and
ducks
be
induced
to
return
they
can
never
prove
an
obstruction
to
navigation
so
why
should
legislation
on
this
point
be
as
at
present
a
mere
farce
the
day
will
never
come
perhaps
when
people
who
prefer
a
living
to
a
dead
bird
will
be
acknowledged
as
having
a
claim
to
the
wild
life
that
would
appear
to
be
no
man
s
peculiar
property
by
an
overwhelming
majority
mankind
hold
if
a
creature
is
good
to
eat
it
must
be
killed
but
the
insignificant
minority
still
feel
they
have
a
claim
i
would
walk
twenty
miles
to
see
a
wild
swan
on
the
delaware
my
neighbor
would
walk
forty
if
sure
of
shooting
it
water
birds
are
safe
on
the
back
bay
in
boston
and
seem
to
know
it
i
have
watched
them
with
delight
morning
after
morning
while
dressing
but
here
miles
from
town
you
may
pass
a
week
and
see
no
trace
of
even
a
duck
a
few
come
and
go
but
there
are
men
with
guns
lying
in
wait
both
day
and
night
time
was
when
there
were
wild
fowl
and
to
spare
not
so
now
and
the
day
is
quickly
coming
when
geese
even
will
rank
with
the
great
auk
and
the
dodo
it
is
probably
not
difficult
to
prove
that
a
return
ramble
is
less
suggestive
even
if
more
objects
cross
our
path
than
when
we
were
outward
bound
at
the
close
of
a
long
day
we
are
without
suspecting
it
brainweary
as
well
as
physically
tired
what
interested
us
in
the
morning
falls
flat
in
the
evening
the
mingled
voices
of
many
birds
roused
enthusiasm
at
sunrise
and
proved
irritating
at
sunset
it
was
so
today
my
one
thought
was
to
reach
home
but
not
without
lazily
thinking
as
i
retraced
my
steps
i
discussed
with
myself
as
often
before
that
important
question
how
to
see
then
again
i
have
often
been
asked
the
same
question
by
various
people
on
one
occasion
i
replied
with
your
wits
as
well
as
your
eyes
but
this
does
not
cover
the
ground
after
all
how
is
a
person
to
recognize
a
thrush
from
a
sparrow
among
birds
or
a
perch
from
a
minnow
among
fishes
when
the
question
was
last
put
i
found
that
i
had
but
one
course
to
pursue
to
admit
that
i
could
not
tell
the
occurrence
was
somewhat
mortifying
and
i
have
time
and
time
again
since
then
endeavored
to
discuss
upon
paper
this
very
interesting
subject
the
result
to
date
is
flat
failure
but
a
history
of
nugatory
effort
may
prove
of
some
value
can
it
be
done
is
there
a
secret
through
knowledge
of
which
a
young
person
or
an
inexperienced
adult
can
be
taught
to
intelligently
observe
and
correctly
interpret
the
course
of
nature
are
not
those
in
truth
who
do
see
to
advantage
and
quickly
comprehend
the
purport
of
what
they
see
born
with
a
faculty
that
can
not
be
acquired
through
any
course
of
training
i
believe
this
to
be
true
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
those
who
though
less
favored
have
their
interest
aroused
whenever
out
of
doors
and
these
are
spurred
to
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
however
toilsome
because
of
the
demands
of
that
interest
such
find
the
pursuit
of
natural
knowledge
far
from
easy
but
are
compensated
by
the
fact
that
the
play
is
worth
the
candle
with
due
modesty
i
speak
now
from
experience
how
am
i
to
know
asked
my
friend
that
the
bird
i
see
or
hear
is
what
it
is
i
for
one
can
not
solve
the
problem
certainly
even
if
our
language
was
adequate
to
describe
the
appearance
voice
and
habits
of
a
bird
for
instance
so
accurately
that
it
would
instantly
be
recognized
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
any
one
save
a
professional
naturalist
will
know
our
ornithology
by
heart
and
even
he
falls
very
short
of
that
in
hopes
of
simplifying
the
matter
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
recall
my
own
experiences
not
that
i
am
a
trained
observer
but
because
i
can
not
remember
when
i
did
not
know
the
more
common
objects
of
wild
life
that
i
met
with
this
knowledge
a
lifelong
source
of
pleasure
was
acquired
at
an
early
age
probably
because
i
had
a
naturalistmother
who
correctly
explained
the
little
mysteries
that
perplexed
me
and
above
all
taught
me
to
be
considerate
toward
and
respect
the
rights
of
every
living
creature
so
it
happened
that
i
came
to
love
even
every
creeping
thing
and
with
love
came
knowledge
but
the
names
of
things
until
he
knew
its
name
thoreau
looked
upon
a
flower
however
beautiful
as
a
stranger
and
held
aloof
certainly
one
feels
a
great
lift
in
his
pursuit
of
knowledge
as
soon
as
he
learns
the
name
of
an
object
and
until
then
however
interesting
that
object
may
be
it
baffles
him
let
the
observer
if
an
adult
remember
and
the
child
be
assured
that
every
creature
has
a
name
and
that
it
can
sooner
or
later
be
determined
and
now
what
remains
is
to
so
closely
examine
it
that
when
opportunity
affords
to
describe
it
to
a
specialist
or
a
description
is
found
in
a
book
the
creature
will
at
once
be
recognized
years
before
i
had
access
to
audubon
s
or
wilson
s
american
ornithology
i
was
delighted
one
summer
day
with
a
large
bird
that
played
bopeep
with
me
in
the
orchard
i
watched
it
carefully
studied
to
repeat
its
cries
and
then
attempted
to
describe
it
the
bird
was
pronounced
a
creation
of
my
imagination
and
my
labors
rewarded
with
a
lecture
on
romancing
but
long
afterward
i
recognized
the
bird
in
a
museum
and
found
that
i
had
seen
a
rare
straggler
from
the
southern
states
but
nothing
of
all
this
bears
much
if
any
upon
my
friend
s
question
and
no
definite
conclusion
has
perhaps
been
reached
so
i
put
myself
in
my
friend
s
place
and
ask
will
some
one
give
me
the
information
required
the
more
the
question
as
originally
put
is
conned
over
the
more
it
is
like
unto
asking
how
do
we
learn
to
talk
let
there
be
a
desire
for
knowledge
and
the
problem
will
solve
itself
and
as
to
natural
history
the
earnest
observer
will
invent
names
for
objects
which
will
serve
his
purpose
until
he
learns
those
as
in
time
he
will
by
which
they
have
been
recognized
by
others
and
are
in
common
use
he
who
does
this
will
have
taken
the
first
and
most
important
step
and
all
that
follows
will
be
pleasure
rather
than
toil
another
phase
of
this
subject
is
that
of
properly
observing
do
we
always
see
straight
i
prefer
this
homely
phrase
in
putting
the
question
because
i
was
so
often
asked
when
reporting
the
results
of
youthful
rambles
did
you
see
straight
are
you
sure
and
so
the
familiar
questions
come
to
mind
now
have
the
summer
tourists
seen
straight
was
everything
they
saw
really
as
they
saw
it
can
i
not
believe
my
own
eyes
is
the
usual
reply
it
is
the
commonly
accepted
opinion
that
we
can
certainly
but
may
not
many
an
error
arise
from
such
testimony
undoubtedly
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
sightseer
is
really
anxious
to
learn
the
exact
truth
if
he
guards
himself
continuously
against
false
impressions
the
danger
is
comparatively
slight
and
diminishes
to
practically
nothing
by
repetition
of
observation
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
an
occurrence
may
be
very
rare
and
if
observed
by
one
not
familiar
with
the
ordinary
conditions
he
may
be
misled
so
far
as
to
suppose
it
not
unusual
but
it
is
far
from
justifiable
to
assert
that
he
did
not
see
straight
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
study
of
nature
by
which
is
meant
at
this
time
the
observation
of
objects
animate
and
inanimate
as
they
are
and
where
they
belong
not
the
study
of
specimens
taken
from
their
proper
places
if
a
bird
is
seen
out
of
season
or
out
of
place
or
copies
the
song
and
manners
of
a
far
different
species
the
observer
is
not
true
to
himself
if
he
withholds
a
statement
as
to
the
fact
although
others
may
not
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
witness
this
and
no
less
imperative
is
it
to
express
his
opinions
and
give
his
own
interpretations
of
what
he
sees
to
say
that
it
is
indiscreet
to
set
his
unsupported
opinion
against
the
facts
gathered
by
a
host
of
observers
is
simply
absurd
to
fail
to
speak
out
boldly
is
miserable
cowardice
and
he
who
advises
silence
because
an
honest
conviction
wars
with
others
opinions
is
contemptible
evidently
having
no
opinions
or
knowledge
of
his
own
he
champions
the
cry
of
the
crowd
be
it
right
or
wrong
when
a
friend
returns
from
a
distant
land
or
even
from
a
walk
in
the
country
we
do
not
ask
concerning
what
we
have
often
seen
for
ourselves
or
know
from
hearsay
is
a
feature
of
the
land
but
of
those
peculiarities
that
particularly
impress
him
and
his
personal
adventures
and
by
proper
questioning
a
dozen
ramblers
over
the
same
area
will
tell
as
many
different
stories
if
every
observer
or
traveler
was
a
mere
cataloguing
machine
what
a
cool
welcome
would
each
receive
on
his
return
from
an
outing
how
are
we
to
know
whether
or
not
we
see
straight
whether
or
not
we
correctly
interpret
time
alone
will
decide
this
adding
thereto
the
experiences
of
others
from
the
sum
total
of
many
observers
will
ultimately
spring
the
truth
if
happily
we
shall
ever
possess
it
but
no
one
experience
must
be
suppressed
i
saw
the
niagara
river
recently
where
it
is
crossed
by
the
suspension
bridge
and
the
water
was
intensely
black
save
where
flecked
with
snowy
foam
i
had
seen
this
river
at
this
same
spot
previously
and
had
seen
it
since
and
always
except
this
one
instance
the
water
was
deeply
blue
or
brilliantly
green
it
may
never
have
been
black
before
and
may
never
be
so
again
but
this
has
no
bearing
upon
the
fact
that
once
at
least
that
torrent
was
as
a
torrent
of
ink
and
so
it
certainly
is
in
one
s
observations
of
animal
life
if
one
is
a
persistent
painstaking
observer
his
experience
will
teem
with
unique
occurrences
but
they
are
none
the
less
valuable
and
worthy
of
record
because
of
their
character
we
hear
now
and
then
of
misconception
of
nature
some
pretentious
critic
assuming
that
another
sees
what
is
not
to
be
seen
hears
what
is
not
to
be
heard
and
attributes
to
the
lower
forms
of
life
faculties
beyond
their
capabilities
by
what
authority
comes
this
provided
absurdity
does
not
enter
into
the
case
has
the
whole
region
of
the
united
states
been
so
ransacked
by
a
handful
of
professionals
that
the
habits
of
every
living
creature
other
than
man
are
known
even
to
the
minutest
details
if
so
where
is
this
vast
store
of
learning
garnered
it
must
still
be
religiously
guarded
by
this
same
handful
the
world
at
large
knows
this
is
nonsense
there
have
not
been
enough
facts
gathered
to
enable
one
to
more
than
conclude
tentatively
a
botanist
not
far
away
remarked
in
my
hearing
that
he
had
tramped
over
the
whole
neighborhood
in
search
of
sundews
he
was
positive
that
none
grew
within
miles
of
his
home
another
with
keener
vision
tramped
the
same
ground
and
found
them
in
abundance
a
host
of
careful
earnest
and
devoted
observers
may
be
unsuccessful
but
that
does
not
prove
that
some
one
may
not
succeed
where
the
others
failed
nor
can
the
animadversions
of
the
critical
alter
the
fact
that
some
one
has
succeeded
have
any
of
those
who
have
spent
the
summer
in
the
country
amused
themselves
by
watching
some
one
animal
as
it
was
busy
with
life
s
cares
i
hope
so
and
while
so
doing
was
the
creature
credited
with
intelligence
or
blind
instinct
i
trust
with
the
former
but
stay
shouts
the
critic
do
you
realize
the
danger
of
loose
interpretation
how
are
we
to
decide
whether
or
not
an
animal
thinks
as
we
do
hereon
hinges
the
whole
matter
obviously
it
can
never
be
demonstrated
with
what
may
be
called
mathematical
certainty
but
the
average
unbiased
observer
will
admit
that
when
a
creature
acts
under
given
circumstances
precisely
as
he
would
do
that
the
brain
directing
those
movements
is
essentially
such
a
brain
as
his
own
to
prove
that
it
is
something
else
is
left
with
those
who
deny
the
position
that
i
take
animals
think
they
are
not
mere
machines
this
position
is
as
rational
as
to
claim
it
of
some
of
the
lowest
existing
races
of
mankind
for
the
claim
is
laid
upon
the
same
class
of
occurrences
to
wander
abroad
whether
in
the
forest
or
on
the
plain
and
not
to
look
upon
animate
creation
as
endowed
with
intelligence
of
course
of
varying
degrees
is
to
go
not
as
an
observer
in
the
true
sense
but
as
one
deaf
and
blind
to
ramble
with
this
conviction
one
will
not
misread
the
book
of
nature
and
so
be
guilty
of
a
literary
crime
if
he
gives
his
story
to
the
world
an
open
winter
i
have
heard
or
read
that
one
may
experience
a
sense
of
weariness
when
surrounded
by
the
best
that
nature
has
to
offer
a
cloying
with
too
many
sweets
as
it
were
it
seems
hard
to
believe
so
rejoiced
is
the
average
rambler
at
the
return
of
spring
but
that
it
is
true
has
recently
dawned
upon
me
here
in
the
wilds
of
jersey
after
some
six
weeks
of
merely
nominal
winter
wherever
there
is
a
little
shelter
from
the
occasional
north
winds
the
immediate
outlook
is
suggestive
of
early
april
but
the
growing
daffodils
and
blooming
hungerplant
deadnettle
chickweed
spring
beauties
violets
and
dandelions
do
not
give
us
a
springtide
landscape
although
columbine
giant
hyssop
motherwort
selfheal
yellow
corydalis
alum
root
false
mitrewort
and
star
of
bethlehem
are
all
green
in
the
sheltered
nooks
and
the
waters
of
many
a
springbasin
glow
as
emeralds
with
their
wealth
of
aquatic
plant
life
it
avails
nothing
that
these
springs
and
outflowing
brooks
teem
with
fish
frogs
salamanders
and
spiders
nor
does
it
matter
that
the
sun
gives
us
summer
heat
and
that
birds
throng
the
underbrush
as
in
nesting
days
still
it
is
winter
this
is
the
crowning
fact
that
colors
every
thought
and
though
we
can
not
step
but
we
crush
a
flower
winter
will
not
be
ignored
nor
would
i
have
it
so
january
has
its
merits
as
well
as
june
and
i
hail
with
pleasure
that
spot
where
frost
has
gained
a
foothold
here
is
one
such
spot
a
circle
of
dead
weeds
bordering
one
of
moss
and
blackberry
canes
in
rank
profusion
arising
as
an
oval
mound
within
all
it
is
an
oddlooking
spot
today
and
sure
to
attract
attention
it
is
unlike
the
average
clump
of
briers
and
properly
should
be
as
it
is
the
sorry
monument
to
a
giant
that
for
century
after
century
dwelt
here
in
glory
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
know
him
well
but
my
misfortune
to
be
too
young
to
assume
the
role
of
historian
here
stood
the
pearson
oak
perhaps
my
learned
botanical
friends
may
take
exceptions
but
i
hold
that
this
tree
was
nearly
if
not
quite
one
thousand
years
old
how
the
indian
looms
up
when
we
think
of
such
a
tree
here
was
a
silent
witness
to
the
everyday
life
of
an
indian
village
that
in
part
rested
in
the
mighty
shadows
that
it
cast
and
later
from
one
huge
limb
dangled
the
rude
pole
swing
that
was
the
delight
of
the
first
of
my
people
born
in
america
being
the
most
prominent
feature
of
the
neighborhood
this
oak
was
brought
within
the
boundary
line
of
two
great
plantations
and
the
half
acre
beneath
its
branches
was
the
common
playground
of
two
families
little
wonder
then
that
in
time
it
was
also
common
courting
ground
indeed
the
phrase
common
in
several
families
now
referring
to
engaged
couples
under
the
oak
has
reference
to
this
tree
and
the
engagements
that
arose
from
frequently
meeting
there
during
the
first
halfcentury
after
the
place
was
settled
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
winter
nothing
perhaps
but
it
seemed
fitting
that
a
film
of
ice
should
cover
the
little
pool
in
the
circle
as
frost
had
blighted
every
shrub
about
when
recalling
that
longgone
past
that
seems
to
us
so
rosyhued
when
comparing
it
with
the
present
ruin
is
stamped
upon
every
feature
of
the
landscape
here
and
it
is
well
that
the
old
oak
that
witnessed
more
mirth
than
sadness
should
have
passed
away
to
those
who
can
walk
eight
furlongs
and
see
only
a
milestone
winter
may
be
a
dreary
season
but
nature
at
rest
for
those
who
love
her
is
a
sleeping
beauty
again
if
it
so
happens
death
is
everywhere
about
you
it
should
not
prove
repulsive
death
is
the
law
of
life
and
not
a
flower
in
june
can
boast
greater
beauty
than
the
empty
seedpods
of
many
a
decaying
plant
shudder
if
you
will
at
the
word
skeleton
but
handle
that
of
many
a
creature
or
plant
and
enthusiastic
admiration
is
sure
to
follow
in
june
we
glory
in
the
deadly
struggle
for
existence
that
everywhere
is
raging
charmed
by
the
flaunting
banners
the
music
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
why
not
then
be
rational
and
cull
beauty
as
well
as
profit
from
the
battlefield
when
the
struggle
is
over
if
a
shrub
is
beautiful
clad
in
motley
garb
should
not
its
filmy
ghost
in
silvery
gray
merit
a
passing
glance
so
ran
my
thoughts
as
i
crossed
my
neighbor
s
field
seeking
new
traces
of
frost
s
handiwork
but
here
i
failed
the
general
aspect
was
wintry
but
definite
results
of
wintry
weather
could
not
be
found
even
on
cold
clay
soil
dandelions
bloomed
and
tissueice
in
the
wagon
ruts
had
no
discouragement
for
the
grass
that
bordered
it
to
sum
up
the
result
rambling
in
january
during
such
winter
as
this
is
not
attractive
unless
one
is
carried
away
by
the
novelty
of
plants
blooming
out
of
season
or
hearing
sounds
when
he
expected
silence
and
a
word
here
of
winter
sounds
except
immediately
before
a
snowstorm
the
country
is
never
silent
here
and
there
the
fields
may
be
deserted
but
birds
are
somewhere
and
these
of
both
sexes
can
not
keep
quiet
long
of
our
winter
birds
it
can
be
said
that
they
are
essentially
noisy
and
chirp
more
if
they
sing
less
than
birds
in
summer
and
in
the
anomalous
condition
of
the
outdoor
world
at
present
it
was
a
relief
to
reach
a
hedge
with
its
complement
of
birds
their
listless
chirping
now
recalled
days
with
the
mercury
near
zero
when
defying
the
keen
wind
from
the
north
they
sang
a
hearty
welcome
to
the
season
and
hailed
every
snowsquall
as
a
gift
from
the
gods
nowhere
else
however
and
i
walked
several
miles
were
birds
to
be
found
save
here
and
there
a
solitary
crow
and
the
conclusion
is
that
such
a
season
drives
off
rather
than
attracts
certain
species
while
others
having
no
incentive
to
migrate
have
not
wandered
this
far
south
i
do
not
know
what
the
result
of
observation
in
general
has
been
but
certainly
over
my
own
rambling
ground
birds
have
been
noticeably
scarce
flowers
out
of
season
are
no
compensation
for
the
losses
that
a
thoroughly
open
winter
brings
upon
us
the
more
so
if
an
open
winter
lessens
the
number
of
our
birds
as
the
sun
rose
today
the
thought
what
splendid
weather
was
uppermost
and
impelled
by
it
i
struck
across
lots
for
the
uncultivated
nooks
that
are
so
pitifully
few
near
by
the
result
has
been
given
not
a
single
satisfactory
feature
in
the
whole
range
of
half
a
dozen
miles
a
little
here
and
there
to
wonder
over
disappointment
at
nearly
every
turn
more
many
more
somber
than
merry
thoughts
and
not
one
successful
effort
at
thinking
any
thought
to
a
logical
conclusion
to
what
is
this
due
without
doubt
to
the
open
season
nor
is
it
strange
in
no
respect
is
nature
soulsatisfying
when
unseasonable
a
cool
june
morning
is
not
a
contradiction
and
is
delightful
but
sultry
january
days
are
an
utter
abomination
midwinter
kicks
over
the
traces
when
daffodils
sport
in
january
sunshine
as
they
are
doing
this
morning
about
the
crooked
maple
wherein
i
sit
and
write
the
truth
is
the
present
conditions
offer
no
pronounced
feature
of
the
open
country
nothing
hot
or
cold
but
all
in
that
lukewarm
condition
tending
to
nausea
nor
is
this
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
that
takes
so
strong
a
hold
upon
mankind
confined
thereto
it
is
seen
in
half
the
creatures
that
one
meets
a
meadowmouse
is
no
sluggard
at
other
times
and
a
lazy
deermouse
is
a
contradiction
but
with
what
measured
steps
and
slow
a
mouse
comes
hobbling
over
the
dead
leaves
about
the
maple
i
am
perched
in
the
creature
looks
at
the
sky
then
at
the
ground
and
finally
at
a
sorry
shrub
with
seedless
pods
not
a
bit
of
animation
in
its
motions
but
the
same
dejected
feelings
i
recognize
in
myself
evidently
held
the
mouse
in
bondage
then
i
moved
suddenly
but
the
creature
merely
looked
up
as
if
surprised
at
so
much
energy
on
my
part
this
was
irritating
so
i
sprang
catlike
to
the
ground
but
only
to
find
the
mouse
just
out
of
reach
and
evidently
not
alarmed
climbing
again
into
the
maple
i
awaited
further
developments
and
saw
at
last
a
whitefooted
or
deermouse
that
seemed
to
me
to
drop
from
branch
to
branch
as
it
descended
from
its
bush
nest
a
dozen
feet
from
the
ground
this
was
indeed
discouraging
usually
there
is
no
more
graceful
sight
in
the
woods
during
autumn
or
winter
than
that
of
this
dainty
mammal
picking
its
way
adown
a
crooked
highway
of
a
tangled
brierpatch
it
is
a
sight
sure
to
be
recorded
in
full
in
my
notebooks
as
every
time
i
witness
it
some
new
grace
marks
the
event
so
i
anticipated
the
old
delight
when
i
caught
my
first
glimpse
of
the
mouse
and
such
a
result
it
is
true
that
if
one
s
feelings
are
out
of
tune
there
may
be
a
distorted
vision
but
not
so
today
the
world
was
askew
and
has
been
since
the
first
frost
for
whoever
knew
the
crows
to
be
silent
positively
silent
as
compared
with
crows
on
a
crisp
frosty
morning
there
were
forty
by
count
that
flew
over
the
maple
and
only
one
gave
tongue
here
i
may
be
charged
with
fancy
but
that
one
crow
gave
out
no
ringing
caw
that
is
music
to
him
who
loves
the
country
it
was
rather
a
fretful
longdrawn
pshaw
and
fittingly
voiced
the
surroundings
a
winter
in
the
tropics
may
be
very
delightful
but
an
open
winter
in
new
jersey
is
an
utter
abomination
a
foggy
morning
we
know
too
little
of
the
world
except
when
bathed
in
sunshine
not
that
i
recognize
any
advantage
in
groping
in
darkness
this
is
too
like
dogmatizing
on
a
theory
but
between
the
obscurity
of
night
and
brilliancy
of
the
day
there
are
happy
mediums
too
commonly
neglected
i
have
lately
been
wandering
through
a
thick
fog
not
a
metaphysical
but
a
material
one
nor
was
it
gloomy
the
fog
was
thick
yet
through
it
streamed
the
level
rays
of
the
rising
sun
gilding
the
topmost
twigs
of
the
forest
trees
roofing
with
gold
a
trackless
wild
beneath
so
changed
for
an
hour
or
more
was
every
longfamiliar
scene
that
as
i
wandered
i
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
the
late
john
cassin
the
ornithologist
has
left
on
record
how
a
vast
multitude
of
crows
tarried
for
some
time
in
independence
square
philadelphia
having
after
leaving
their
roosting
grounds
lost
their
reckoning
in
a
dense
fog
he
tells
us
how
the
masses
obeyed
a
few
leaders
and
how
methodically
they
all
departed
led
by
their
appointed
scouts
it
was
an
incident
that
thrilled
him
more
than
all
else
that
he
had
witnessed
and
none
knew
our
birds
in
their
homes
better
than
he
the
bewildered
crows
this
morning
recalled
this
story
for
the
poor
birds
were
in
a
hopeless
plight
perhaps
their
leaders
were
at
loggerheads
or
being
none
it
was
a
case
of
each
for
himself
and
illluck
catch
the
hindmost
be
this
as
it
may
their
partycries
filled
the
misty
air
and
relieved
me
of
all
feeling
of
loneliness
from
the
open
meadows
i
ventured
into
a
gloomy
wood
leaving
the
crows
to
solve
their
own
problems
here
the
fog
proved
an
enormous
lens
and
at
the
same
time
obscuring
the
tops
of
even
dwarfed
undergrowth
made
them
appear
as
trees
and
the
taller
grasses
that
had
withstood
the
winter
were
as
shrubbery
it
was
this
most
strange
effect
that
made
my
old
playground
as
a
land
unknown
but
as
the
wild
cries
of
the
troubled
crows
grew
faint
the
sense
of
loneliness
against
which
one
naturally
rebels
assumed
mastery
and
i
longed
for
at
least
sunlight
that
the
familiar
trees
might
be
stripped
of
their
masks
one
s
own
thoughts
should
be
acceptable
company
at
all
times
but
mine
are
not
in
the
gray
of
a
winter
morning
and
fogwrapped
at
that
nevertheless
longing
as
i
did
for
others
voices
i
protested
then
and
there
against
my
dependence
upon
birdlife
are
there
no
other
creatures
astir
i
asked
and
pushed
on
yet
deeper
where
the
old
oaks
were
clustered
into
whatever
seemed
a
shelter
i
peered
and
often
thrust
my
arm
in
hopes
of
feeling
some
furry
yet
not
too
responsive
mass
nothing
resented
my
unmannered
intrusion
then
into
sundry
hollow
trees
i
thrust
my
cane
thinking
at
least
an
owl
might
be
roused
from
his
slumbers
but
illluck
attended
me
a
little
later
as
the
sun
rose
fairly
high
the
upper
fog
descended
and
so
far
increased
the
gloom
in
the
forest
but
beyond
it
as
i
looked
down
a
long
woodpath
i
saw
the
cold
gray
light
that
brightened
the
outer
world
among
the
trees
there
was
no
dispelling
force
and
the
fog
became
denser
until
overcome
by
its
own
weight
it
turned
to
rain
and
such
a
shower
the
mists
of
the
open
air
had
fled
while
through
the
woods
the
raindrops
touched
with
a
mellow
light
shone
as
molten
metal
rebounding
from
the
interlacing
twigs
above
and
the
carpet
of
matted
leaves
below
these
golden
drops
rang
up
as
might
a
myriad
of
bells
the
laggard
life
about
me
rang
up
the
timid
shrews
and
one
darted
among
the
dead
leaves
and
moss
as
though
hotly
pursued
aroused
the
squirrels
and
creeping
stealthily
down
an
oak
s
extended
arms
a
pair
passed
by
thinking
by
their
cunning
to
escape
my
notice
called
forth
a
whitefooted
mouse
daintiest
of
all
our
mammals
that
picked
its
tortuous
way
to
the
meadow
from
its
bushnest
in
the
briers
what
folly
to
suppose
there
is
no
life
about
you
because
it
eludes
your
search
the
quickening
rays
of
the
sun
have
keener
vision
than
any
man
however
gifted
in
woodcraft
and
these
today
peered
directly
into
every
creature
s
lair
i
might
have
searched
in
vain
for
half
a
day
yet
found
nothing
among
the
trees
even
the
nest
of
the
mouse
in
the
bushes
i
had
mistaken
for
a
cluster
of
thornpierced
autumn
leaves
it
would
seem
as
if
every
creature
anticipated
the
possible
visit
of
a
paul
pry
and
was
cunning
enough
to
outwit
him
the
greater
the
effort
made
by
the
intruder
the
less
are
his
chances
of
seeing
much
let
him
be
patient
often
a
moment
or
two
spent
leaning
against
a
tree
effects
more
than
a
mile
of
noisy
plowing
through
the
brittle
crackling
leaves
the
careless
snapping
of
a
twig
may
not
startle
you
but
it
telegraphs
your
whereabouts
to
creatures
many
a
rod
away
how
do
i
know
this
in
this
way
not
long
since
i
was
watching
a
weasel
as
it
tipped
along
the
rough
rails
of
an
old
worm
fence
it
was
intently
engaged
following
the
trail
of
a
ground
squirrel
perhaps
suddenly
as
if
shot
it
stood
in
a
halferect
posture
turned
its
head
quickly
from
one
side
to
the
other
then
rested
one
ear
on
or
very
near
the
rail
as
i
thought
then
reassumed
a
semierect
position
gave
a
quick
barklike
cry
and
disappeared
there
was
no
mistaking
the
meaning
of
every
movement
the
animal
had
heard
a
suspicious
sound
and
recognizing
it
as
fraught
with
danger
promptly
sought
safety
extremely
curious
myself
to
learn
what
the
weasel
had
heard
for
i
was
sure
it
was
the
sound
of
an
approaching
object
i
sat
perfectly
still
awaiting
coming
events
the
mystery
was
quickly
solved
a
man
drew
near
in
about
two
minutes
i
heard
footsteps
and
in
two
more
saw
the
man
approaching
calculating
the
element
of
time
in
the
succession
of
events
it
appeared
that
the
weasel
heard
the
approaching
footsteps
first
fully
one
minute
before
i
did
and
about
six
elapsed
before
the
man
reached
me
from
the
time
of
the
weasel
s
disappearance
in
all
some
seven
minutes
now
allowing
twenty
paces
to
the
minute
and
two
and
one
half
feet
to
the
pace
this
man
was
considerably
more
than
one
hundred
yards
distant
indeed
i
think
he
was
walking
faster
and
took
longer
steps
than
i
have
allowed
in
my
calculation
and
was
really
still
farther
away
than
yards
when
the
weasel
caught
the
sound
of
his
approach
is
it
any
wonder
then
that
the
woods
seem
silent
as
we
saunter
carelessly
along
the
question
now
arises
can
any
animal
distinguish
between
the
sounds
of
the
footsteps
of
our
many
wild
and
domestic
animals
can
any
one
of
them
recognize
the
difference
between
the
steps
of
a
man
fox
cow
or
rat
now
a
weasel
for
instance
would
not
fear
a
cow
or
a
sheep
but
would
flee
ordinarily
from
a
man
or
a
dog
and
so
such
power
of
discrimination
would
be
very
useful
to
it
i
am
positive
that
they
can
distinguish
in
the
manner
pointed
out
between
friend
and
foe
and
so
are
not
required
to
seek
safety
at
every
unusual
sound
i
know
that
the
most
dolorous
screeching
made
by
branches
rubbing
together
whenever
the
wind
blew
had
no
terror
for
squirrels
or
rabbits
yet
they
must
have
trembled
when
they
first
heard
it
i
remember
very
well
that
i
did
that
fish
can
recognize
the
approach
of
a
man
and
will
hide
and
yet
pay
not
the
slightest
attention
to
galloping
horses
or
tramping
cattle
that
come
near
is
well
known
and
i
can
see
no
reason
to
deny
a
like
discriminating
ability
to
those
animals
whose
very
existence
depends
upon
it
the
fact
that
such
a
power
is
the
mainspring
of
their
safety
is
of
itself
a
warrant
for
our
belief
that
they
possess
it
and
from
what
i
have
observed
of
animal
life
i
am
further
convinced
that
the
power
grows
with
the
animal
s
growth
hence
the
necessity
of
the
young
remaining
as
they
do
with
their
parents
until
well
matured
the
sense
of
hearing
in
a
weasel
raccoon
or
other
creature
is
one
that
develops
and
doubtless
varies
in
efficiency
among
individuals
there
is
no
cutanddried
instinct
about
it
i
have
often
thought
how
much
there
is
in
the
saying
common
among
trappers
concerning
very
cunning
animals
of
any
kind
he
is
too
old
to
be
caught
as
chance
has
offered
i
have
experimented
upon
our
wild
animals
as
to
this
very
point
and
though
the
results
were
largely
negative
there
was
nothing
in
them
that
showed
my
inference
or
conviction
rather
to
be
untrue
and
on
the
other
hand
much
that
pointed
unmistakably
the
other
way
but
what
of
the
clearing
fog
true
enough
i
have
drifted
from
it
and
it
has
passed
earthward
and
away
so
may
it
ever
be
let
but
a
bird
pass
by
singing
or
silent
it
matters
not
let
but
the
shadow
of
a
fleeing
creature
cross
my
path
and
clouds
sunshine
storm
or
fairest
weather
are
alike
one
the
old
farm
s
woodpile
in
winter
s
tedious
nights
sit
by
the
fire
with
good
old
folks
and
let
them
tell
thee
tales
of
woful
ages
long
ago
this
was
my
wont
just
forty
years
ago
but
such
nights
were
never
tedious
nor
were
the
ages
woful
of
which
the
old
folks
chatted
sitting
by
the
fire
tonight
i
am
led
to
contemplate
not
so
much
the
heapedup
logs
and
cheerful
blaze
before
me
as
that
other
feature
of
days
gone
by
the
old
farm
s
woodpile
recalling
both
what
i
saw
and
heard
when
a
lad
of
a
few
summers
i
am
startled
to
find
that
one
after
the
other
the
prominent
features
of
my
childhood
s
days
have
largely
disappeared
improved
farm
machinery
may
delight
the
economist
but
its
introduction
has
added
no
new
charm
to
country
life
and
robbed
it
of
more
than
one
was
there
not
a
subtle
something
in
the
swish
of
the
scythe
to
be
preferred
to
the
click
of
the
modern
mower
harvest
comes
and
goes
now
without
a
ripple
of
excitement
upon
the
farm
a
hum
of
the
reaper
for
a
few
hours
and
the
work
is
done
a
portable
steamengine
puffs
in
the
field
for
a
day
and
the
threshing
is
over
but
what
a
long
series
of
delights
at
least
to
the
onlooker
when
grain
was
cradled
shocked
and
then
carted
to
the
barn
and
later
far
in
the
winter
what
music
was
the
measured
thumping
of
the
flails
in
due
course
came
the
present
order
the
natural
outcome
of
relentless
evolution
and
it
is
affectation
to
decry
it
mankind
in
the
long
run
has
been
benefited
and
all
should
be
thankful
but
with
these
major
changes
have
come
minor
ones
that
i
trust
can
be
mourned
without
risking
a
charge
of
silliness
i
need
not
name
them
mention
of
any
one
calls
up
the
rest
so
closely
related
were
they
all
who
can
think
of
the
old
woodpile
a
maze
of
gnarly
sticks
huge
choppinglog
and
the
rudely
hafted
axe
without
a
vision
also
of
the
old
kitchen
with
its
cavernous
fireplace
and
just
outside
the
door
the
mossy
well
with
its
ungainly
sweep
all
these
were
practically
out
of
date
in
my
time
but
here
and
there
were
retained
on
more
than
one
old
farm
i
knew
and
are
still
in
use
within
walking
distance
of
my
home
to
many
perhaps
a
woodpile
is
but
a
pile
of
wood
but
it
is
something
more
can
you
not
see
that
the
ground
is
depressed
as
though
the
earth
had
been
beaten
down
by
the
continued
blows
of
axe
and
beetle
do
you
not
notice
that
the
outlying
weeds
are
different
from
those
that
are
scattered
elsewhere
about
the
dooryard
here
there
is
not
only
a
woodpile
now
but
there
has
been
one
for
many
a
long
year
perhaps
for
more
than
a
century
turn
up
the
soil
and
you
will
find
it
black
examine
it
with
a
lens
and
you
will
find
it
filled
with
wood
fiber
in
every
stage
of
decomposition
dig
deeper
and
you
will
find
many
a
relic
of
a
bygone
generation
pewter
buttons
that
once
shone
like
silver
the
pride
of
beaux
who
though
quakers
loved
a
smartlooking
coat
buckles
worn
at
the
knee
and
upon
the
shoes
bits
of
spectacle
rims
that
once
held
circular
glasses
of
enormous
diameter
a
thousand
odds
and
ends
indeed
of
metal
glass
and
china
discarded
one
by
one
as
they
were
broken
for
the
woodpile
was
a
dustheap
as
well
and
the
last
restingplace
of
every
small
object
that
could
not
be
burned
my
own
earliest
recollection
of
outdoor
sport
is
of
playing
house
about
the
generous
heap
of
gnarly
logs
and
crooked
branches
that
had
been
brought
from
the
woods
during
the
winter
at
some
convenient
corner
the
loose
earth
would
be
scooped
away
water
brought
until
the
hollow
was
filled
and
a
long
row
of
mud
pies
molded
in
clamshells
the
product
of
a
happy
morning
s
work
it
was
usually
when
thus
engaged
that
some
curious
object
would
be
brought
to
light
and
referred
for
explanation
to
the
woodchopper
if
he
were
present
i
can
see
two
old
men
now
whose
sole
occupation
in
their
later
years
so
far
as
i
can
recall
was
to
split
wood
these
two
men
uz
gaunt
and
miles
overfield
were
master
hands
with
an
axe
as
they
promptly
said
of
themselves
with
one
foot
resting
upon
the
choppingblock
and
leaning
upon
his
axe
uz
or
miles
would
critically
examine
whatever
i
had
found
and
then
after
silently
gazing
into
the
distance
to
recall
the
past
with
what
an
air
of
wisdom
would
the
information
be
forthcoming
nor
would
either
of
these
old
men
ever
promptly
resume
his
labor
such
an
interruption
was
sure
to
call
up
a
flood
of
memories
and
delightful
stories
of
long
ago
made
me
quite
forget
my
play
nothing
that
my
own
or
another
s
brain
could
suggest
ever
equaled
in
interest
these
old
men
s
stories
i
can
not
clearly
recall
a
single
one
of
them
now
but
simply
the
effect
they
produced
and
the
sad
fact
that
in
their
estimation
the
present
never
favorably
compared
with
the
days
when
they
were
young
and
is
it
not
ever
so
if
i
have
learned
nothing
else
since
then
i
have
learned
this
that
the
glorious
future
to
which
as
a
child
i
looked
forward
has
proved
everything
but
what
my
fancy
painted
there
was
a
comic
side
to
my
interviews
with
the
woodchoppers
which
i
recall
even
now
with
grim
satisfaction
for
i
think
it
was
right
that
i
outwitted
an
unreasonably
crossgrained
aunt
often
my
heart
was
sorely
troubled
because
in
the
midst
of
a
most
exciting
story
aunt
would
call
out
thee
is
hindering
miles
at
his
work
he
doesn
t
like
to
be
bothered
all
of
which
was
in
the
interest
of
the
work
being
done
and
not
miles
s
comfort
not
like
to
be
bothered
indeed
neither
he
nor
uz
disapproved
of
loitering
for
both
were
old
and
aunt
knew
this
as
well
as
they
before
summer
was
over
a
stratagem
was
devised
that
succeeded
admirably
i
had
merely
to
take
my
place
on
the
off
side
of
the
woodpile
where
i
was
quite
out
of
sight
and
miles
or
uz
would
work
oh
so
diligently
at
the
light
wood
for
half
a
day
which
needed
next
to
no
exertion
and
all
the
while
could
talk
as
freely
as
when
taking
his
nooning
perhaps
it
was
not
well
but
young
as
i
then
was
i
learned
that
in
human
nature
the
real
and
the
apparent
are
too
often
as
widely
apart
as
the
poles
the
wild
life
that
forty
years
ago
lurked
in
the
woods
and
swamps
of
the
old
farm
was
not
different
from
what
is
still
to
be
found
there
but
there
has
been
a
great
decrease
in
the
numbers
of
many
forms
the
wild
cat
and
fox
perhaps
may
be
considered
as
really
extinct
although
both
are
reported
at
long
intervals
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
these
it
is
certain
are
stragglers
the
former
from
the
mountains
to
north
the
latter
from
the
pine
regions
toward
the
seacoast
but
it
has
not
been
long
since
the
raccoon
was
regularly
hunted
during
the
moonlit
winter
nights
and
the
opposum
found
security
in
half
the
hollow
trees
along
the
hillside
the
dreaded
skunk
was
then
abundant
none
of
these
however
can
be
said
to
be
of
common
occurrence
now
and
their
discovery
produces
a
ripple
of
excitement
at
present
while
in
my
early
days
their
capture
excited
scarcely
a
word
of
comment
then
the
old
woodpile
was
not
infrequently
the
hidingplace
of
one
or
more
of
these
varmints
which
raided
the
henroost
kept
the
old
dog
in
a
fever
of
excitement
and
baffled
the
trapping
skill
of
the
oldest
hands
upon
the
farm
now
at
best
when
the
last
sticks
are
cut
and
stored
in
the
woodshed
the
burrow
of
a
rat
is
all
we
find
with
what
glee
do
i
still
recall
an
autumn
evening
years
ago
when
the
unusually
furious
barking
of
the
old
mastiff
brought
the
whole
family
to
the
door
in
the
dim
twilight
the
dog
could
be
seen
dashing
at
and
retreating
from
the
woodpile
and
at
once
the
meaning
of
the
hubbub
was
apparent
some
creature
had
taken
refuge
there
a
lantern
was
brought
and
as
every
man
wished
to
be
the
hero
of
the
hour
my
aunt
held
the
light
the
woodpile
was
surrounded
every
stick
was
quickly
overturned
and
finally
a
skunk
was
dislodged
confused
or
attracted
by
the
light
i
do
not
know
which
the
varmint
made
straightway
for
the
ample
skirts
of
the
old
lady
followed
by
the
dog
and
in
a
second
skunk
dog
lady
and
lantern
were
one
indistinguishable
mass
my
aunt
proved
the
heroine
of
the
evening
nor
did
the
men
object
i
often
pause
at
the
very
spot
and
fancy
that
the
scent
of
the
roses
doth
hang
round
it
still
a
woodpile
if
it
be
not
too
near
the
house
has
many
attractions
for
birds
of
various
kinds
and
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
why
the
whippoorwill
should
of
recent
years
have
forsaken
it
formerly
the
first
of
these
birds
heard
in
early
spring
was
that
which
perched
upon
the
topmost
stick
and
whistled
his
trisyllabic
monologue
from
dark
to
dawn
now
they
frequent
only
the
retired
woodland
tracts
various
insecteating
birds
continually
come
and
go
attracted
by
the
food
they
find
in
the
decayed
wood
but
the
housewren
remains
throughout
its
summer
sojourn
here
that
is
from
april
to
october
while
during
the
colder
months
the
winter
wren
takes
the
other
s
place
these
little
brown
birds
are
exceedingly
alike
in
appearance
in
habits
and
in
size
and
i
shall
never
forget
my
communicating
the
fact
that
they
were
not
the
same
to
miles
overfield
it
was
almost
my
last
conversation
with
him
not
the
same
he
exclaimed
you
might
as
well
tell
me
that
a
snowbird
isn
t
a
chippy
in
its
winter
dress
they
are
not
indeed
i
replied
astonished
to
hear
so
remarkable
a
statement
so
you
set
up
booklearnin
against
me
about
such
things
as
that
eh
miles
remarked
with
unlimited
scorn
in
both
his
voice
and
manner
and
from
that
time
i
lost
favor
in
his
eyes
such
crude
ideas
concerning
our
common
birds
are
still
very
common
nor
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
knowledge
of
local
natural
history
is
still
at
a
discount
is
there
a
country
school
where
even
its
barest
rudiments
are
taught
the
heapedup
logs
that
burning
brightly
made
cheery
my
room
when
i
sat
down
for
a
quiet
evening
s
meditation
are
now
a
bed
of
ashes
and
lurid
coals
they
typify
the
modern
woodpiles
about
our
farms
mere
heaps
of
refuse
sticks
and
windfall
branches
of
our
dooryard
trees
fit
for
kindling
perhaps
but
never
for
a
generous
fire
upon
an
open
hearth
as
i
linger
over
them
the
irrecoverable
past
with
all
its
pleasures
to
the
fore
comes
back
with
painful
vividness
the
fantastic
shapes
of
the
ruddy
coals
the
caverns
in
the
loose
ashes
the
shadows
of
the
andirons
the
filmy
thread
of
smoke
are
a
landscape
to
my
fancy
upon
which
my
eyes
can
never
dwell
again
in
the
faint
moaning
of
the
wind
that
fills
the
chimney
corner
i
hear
a
voice
long
stilled
whose
music
led
me
dancing
through
the
world
place
and
people
are
alike
changed
all
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
part
ii
in
spring
the
april
moon
of
the
thirteen
moons
of
the
year
not
one
is
of
such
significance
to
the
outdoor
naturalist
as
that
of
april
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
a
clear
sky
rather
than
temperature
is
the
important
factor
in
the
migratory
movement
of
our
birds
that
come
from
the
south
in
spring
certainly
the
morning
of
april
th
of
this
year
was
cool
enough
to
have
retarded
birds
sensitive
to
cold
ice
formed
on
shallow
ponds
and
a
heavy
frost
rested
upon
all
the
upland
fields
yet
at
sunrise
the
old
beeches
were
alive
with
those
beautiful
birds
the
yellow
redpolled
warblers
nor
were
they
numb
or
dumb
there
was
not
an
instant
that
they
rested
nor
a
moment
that
they
did
not
sing
the
april
moon
too
has
the
merit
of
brightening
the
marshes
when
in
fullest
force
the
frogworld
comes
to
the
fore
and
perhaps
never
are
these
slimy
batrachians
so
noisy
as
when
the
night
is
warm
the
sky
clear
and
the
moon
full
in
april
take
a
midnight
ramble
then
and
see
if
i
am
not
right
of
course
no
one
wishes
to
be
confined
to
the
company
of
croaking
frogs
but
other
creatures
will
doubtless
cross
your
path
and
i
assume
the
reader
does
not
live
in
an
utterly
desolate
region
my
reference
to
frogs
may
seem
to
imply
contempt
but
it
is
not
deserved
if
they
are
not
overwise
neither
are
they
wholly
stupid
and
it
is
well
for
all
men
to
be
chary
of
their
judgments
there
are
times
and
occasions
when
a
frog
may
outwit
a
philosopher
try
to
catch
one
on
slippery
mud
and
see
which
sprawls
the
more
gracefully
i
recently
rambled
for
half
a
night
over
acres
of
wild
marsh
and
while
i
often
wished
myself
at
home
or
that
i
could
grasp
the
arm
of
a
friend
yet
am
heartily
glad
now
that
it
is
over
that
i
undertook
to
trespass
upon
the
haunts
of
owls
frogs
bitterns
and
a
host
of
minor
creatures
but
let
me
be
more
explicit
and
a
word
further
concerning
frogs
in
the
tide
marshes
where
the
shallow
water
has
been
warmed
by
the
noonday
sun
the
pretty
little
hylodes
were
holding
high
carnival
i
strolled
leisurely
at
this
stage
of
my
ramble
to
the
water
s
edge
but
only
to
find
that
the
creatures
could
only
be
heard
not
seen
unless
indeed
the
trembling
specks
upon
the
glimmering
pools
which
faded
out
at
my
approach
were
they
the
piercing
shrillness
of
their
united
songs
was
something
wonderful
it
was
not
so
much
a
chorus
as
the
wildest
orgies
of
lilliputian
fifers
at
times
the
song
of
this
same
frog
is
the
sharp
clicking
of
a
castanet
hence
their
name
in
zoölogy
acris
crepitans
but
none
were
crepitating
that
night
yesterday
i
waded
into
a
wet
meadow
and
crouched
upon
a
projecting
hassock
thousands
of
the
fifing
frogs
were
about
me
but
i
could
see
none
i
long
sat
there
hoping
that
my
patience
would
be
rewarded
in
time
and
so
it
was
at
last
one
came
cautiously
from
its
hidingplace
in
the
submerged
grass
thrusting
but
its
head
above
the
water
s
surface
and
scanned
closely
its
surroundings
it
eyed
me
most
suspiciously
and
then
slowly
crawled
out
upon
outreaching
grass
until
quite
above
the
water
it
seemed
very
long
before
it
was
suited
to
its
perch
but
when
comfortably
fixed
appeared
to
gulp
in
a
great
mouthful
of
air
in
fact
must
have
done
so
for
immediately
an
enormous
globular
sac
formed
beneath
its
lower
jaw
the
sunlight
being
favorable
i
could
see
that
the
sac
contained
about
two
drops
of
water
then
the
fifing
commenced
the
motion
of
the
mouth
was
too
slight
to
be
detected
but
the
membranous
globe
decreased
or
increased
with
each
utterance
at
no
time
did
it
wholly
disappear
noting
so
much
i
then
moved
slightly
to
attract
the
creature
s
attention
immediately
it
ceased
fifing
but
the
sac
remained
slightly
diminished
in
size
as
i
was
again
perfectly
quiet
its
confidence
returned
and
the
shrill
monotonous
peep
was
resumed
but
pitched
in
even
a
higher
key
as
though
to
make
good
the
loss
of
time
my
slight
interference
had
caused
when
peter
kalm
the
swedish
naturalist
was
studying
the
natural
history
of
new
jersey
he
was
much
struck
with
the
noises
made
by
certain
small
frogs
which
he
heard
and
supposed
that
he
saw
but
it
would
appear
from
a
recent
study
of
the
subject
by
prof
garman
of
cambridge
mass
that
kalm
attributed
the
voices
of
one
species
to
a
very
different
and
much
larger
frog
the
reasons
given
for
this
opinion
by
prof
garman
are
conclusive
that
author
remarks
apparently
the
frog
kalm
heard
was
not
the
one
he
caught
the
cry
is
that
of
hyla
pickeringii
the
frog
taken
was
probably
the
leopard
frog
so
far
garman
but
i
am
convinced
my
friend
is
mistaken
and
that
kalm
heard
the
shrill
peeping
of
the
little
acris
crepitans
which
is
extraordinarily
abundant
while
in
the
locality
where
kalm
was
pickering
s
hyla
is
comparatively
rare
i
lingered
long
by
the
resounding
marsh
so
long
that
the
chilly
damp
provoked
an
aguish
pain
and
admonished
by
it
i
turned
toward
the
leafless
trees
upon
the
bluff
where
i
hoped
to
find
a
drier
atmosphere
the
moon
was
well
upon
her
westward
course
when
i
reached
higher
ground
and
what
a
change
from
the
open
meadows
to
gloomy
woodland
the
dark
shadows
of
noonday
are
not
repeated
during
a
moonlit
night
they
are
not
only
less
distinct
but
quivering
as
though
they
too
shivered
as
the
air
grew
cold
it
is
not
strange
that
one
peoples
the
distance
then
with
uncouth
shapes
and
sees
a
monster
wherever
moves
a
mite
however
one
may
argue
to
himself
that
this
is
the
same
woodpath
down
which
he
daily
passes
without
a
thought
and
that
since
sunset
no
strange
creatures
can
have
come
upon
the
scene
he
sees
a
dozen
such
it
may
be
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
laugh
them
out
of
existence
let
a
spider
crawl
over
your
face
at
noon
and
you
brush
the
creature
from
you
almost
unconsciously
let
a
filmy
cobweb
rest
upon
your
damp
forehead
at
midnight
and
you
struggle
to
be
rid
of
it
as
though
bound
with
a
rope
the
mingled
sounds
of
myriad
frogs
the
hooting
of
owls
the
rustling
leaves
beneath
the
shrew
s
light
tread
even
the
chirping
of
a
dreaming
bird
can
not
assure
you
every
tree
is
the
ambush
of
a
lurking
elf
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
follow
in
your
steps
i
have
abundant
sympathy
for
those
who
walking
through
moonlit
woods
whistle
to
keep
their
courage
up
such
in
a
measure
were
my
own
feelings
until
i
reached
a
glade
where
the
light
fell
softly
upon
the
windswept
sod
there
the
immaterial
world
vanished
and
i
was
no
longer
the
companion
of
uncanny
sprites
resting
from
a
long
journey
yet
not
disposed
to
sleep
a
pair
of
woodcocks
stalked
leisurely
across
my
path
without
deigning
to
notice
my
approach
i
drew
back
a
pace
or
two
and
watched
them
pass
by
they
did
not
leave
the
glade
but
seemed
to
be
scanning
every
foot
of
it
perhaps
discussing
its
merits
as
a
summer
resort
then
first
one
and
then
the
other
took
a
short
upward
and
circuitous
flight
and
in
a
few
seconds
returned
this
was
frequently
done
was
it
to
hail
passing
migrants
i
ask
this
seriously
for
i
have
known
several
pairs
to
frequent
a
cluster
of
rhododendrons
all
through
the
month
of
march
and
yet
none
nested
until
late
in
april
per
contra
i
have
found
their
eggs
in
february
the
movements
of
this
pair
as
i
saw
them
were
mysterious
but
i
could
do
nothing
in
so
uncertain
a
light
toward
unraveling
the
mystery
and
contented
myself
with
attracting
their
attention
i
whistled
shrilly
but
a
single
note
and
as
if
shot
the
birds
came
to
a
halt
i
whistled
again
and
they
drew
nearer
to
me
as
i
thought
but
if
so
i
became
no
mystery
to
them
and
upward
and
outward
over
the
meadows
with
a
great
whirring
of
their
wings
they
vanished
this
was
so
trivial
an
incident
that
had
it
no
sequel
would
not
be
worthy
of
record
i
have
said
i
whistled
shrilly
a
single
note
it
roused
a
sleeping
cardinal
near
by
which
straightened
its
crest
shook
out
its
rumpled
down
stared
into
vacant
space
and
whistled
in
return
i
quickly
replied
and
so
we
had
the
woods
to
echo
with
our
calls
what
can
the
matter
be
asked
another
and
another
of
these
birds
until
the
whole
hillside
sounded
with
their
cries
i
was
lonely
no
longer
the
moon
shone
with
added
luster
the
grewsome
shadows
of
the
dwarfed
cedars
fled
and
but
for
the
twinkling
of
a
million
stars
i
might
have
thought
it
day
but
the
pleasing
fancy
was
of
short
duration
bird
after
bird
resumed
its
slumbers
silence
and
a
deeper
gloom
reigned
in
the
forest
nor
did
my
heart
cease
to
beat
nervously
until
i
reached
my
home
concerning
small
owls
it
may
be
april
according
to
the
almanac
and
yet
midwinter
judging
by
the
thermometer
and
perhaps
as
a
rule
march
winds
continue
their
chilly
gustiness
until
the
fourth
month
is
well
advanced
i
have
scoured
a
weatherwise
neighborhood
for
some
saying
about
this
feature
of
our
climate
but
gathered
nothing
not
absolutely
childish
but
if
so
run
the
days
the
nights
of
april
have
a
merit
peculiarly
their
own
by
the
light
of
the
waxing
moon
let
the
temperature
be
high
or
low
the
northbound
migratory
birds
begin
to
come
i
saw
a
few
of
them
during
the
last
week
in
march
but
it
was
when
the
april
moon
was
eight
days
old
that
field
sparrows
trooped
hitherward
by
thousands
and
how
the
bare
upland
fields
rang
with
their
glee
there
is
another
happy
feature
of
spring
s
initial
days
the
winds
be
they
never
so
boisterous
from
dawn
to
sunset
rest
during
the
night
and
nocturnal
life
rejoices
what
a
mighty
volume
of
sound
arises
from
the
marshes
when
the
windtossed
waters
are
at
rest
the
tiny
hylodes
the
smallest
of
our
frogs
is
fairly
ecstatic
now
and
were
there
no
other
voices
to
be
heard
this
creature
alone
would
dispel
all
feeling
of
loneliness
but
what
of
a
ramble
during
an
april
night
after
an
almost
tempestuous
day
there
was
little
promise
of
anything
akin
to
adventure
judging
the
landscape
from
my
open
door
however
confirmed
in
the
strolling
habit
might
be
the
saunterer
rambling
at
night
with
but
frogs
for
company
is
scarcely
tempting
even
though
the
moon
shines
brilliantly
then
it
occurred
to
me
is
it
not
enough
that
the
wind
had
ceased
and
that
outofdoors
it
is
something
more
than
merely
april
in
name
therefore
expecting
little
and
hoping
less
i
ventured
abroad
directing
my
steps
as
usual
meadowward
and
it
was
not
with
as
might
seem
at
first
an
altogether
undesirable
and
nonreceptive
frame
of
mind
one
is
far
more
likely
to
be
content
with
little
and
not
wholly
disappointed
if
his
walk
proves
without
adventure
but
the
latter
is
seldom
or
never
the
result
it
is
a
strange
night
that
finds
the
whole
world
asleep
certainly
i
never
found
it
so
before
and
did
not
tonight
by
the
pale
light
of
the
cloudwrapped
moon
stately
herons
wended
their
way
from
the
river
to
the
meadows
and
twice
a
little
owl
hooted
at
me
as
i
passed
by
the
hollow
hickory
that
stands
as
a
lonely
sentinel
in
the
midst
of
a
wide
reach
of
pasture
here
was
an
instance
when
to
be
hooted
at
was
a
positive
pleasure
the
little
owlet
questioned
the
propriety
of
my
being
abroad
at
night
nor
was
he
at
all
mealymouthed
he
did
not
complain
merely
but
scolded
unmistakably
and
hovering
above
me
as
well
as
when
flitting
from
branch
to
branch
he
snapped
his
little
beak
most
viciously
it
was
evident
that
fear
of
myself
did
not
influence
the
owl
at
all
but
he
was
provoked
because
my
presence
interfered
with
his
plans
the
bird
knew
well
enough
that
i
would
keep
the
mice
away
by
standing
in
full
sight
out
in
the
open
meadow
i
have
been
puzzled
at
times
to
interpret
the
chirps
and
twitters
of
excited
birds
and
this
irate
little
owl
cried
get
out
as
plainly
as
man
could
speak
it
and
i
got
out
in
all
works
treating
of
the
intelligence
of
animals
there
is
much
said
of
the
mental
status
of
parrots
and
little
or
nothing
of
the
motherwit
of
owls
why
this
oversight
is
a
mystery
unless
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
from
the
nocturnal
preferences
of
most
owls
their
habits
are
very
slightly
known
and
many
interesting
facts
are
doubtless
to
be
discovered
in
this
direction
more
often
heard
than
seen
even
their
notes
are
only
imperfectly
known
as
yet
notwithstanding
this
owls
are
well
known
in
a
general
way
better
known
indeed
than
any
other
family
of
birds
their
appearance
is
striking
their
expression
intelligent
and
that
they
were
selected
in
ancient
and
more
poetical
times
as
the
emblem
of
wisdom
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
the
bird
of
minerva
does
not
belie
its
looks
to
speak
of
an
owl
s
wisdom
in
a
pickwickian
sense
is
to
publish
one
s
own
ignorance
i
would
that
i
might
venture
to
give
in
merited
detail
an
account
of
the
wise
doings
if
not
sayings
of
little
red
owls
that
i
have
held
captives
for
months
and
better
yet
narrate
the
summer
histories
of
owls
at
freedom
that
nested
in
the
old
orchard
or
write
of
the
cunning
ways
of
the
handsome
barnowls
those
beautiful
cosmopolite
birds
that
made
their
home
in
a
hollow
oak
upon
an
upland
field
to
do
this
would
be
to
place
our
common
owls
where
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
they
rightfully
belong
of
all
our
birds
they
are
the
least
governed
by
mere
impulse
and
pass
their
days
as
it
has
appeared
to
me
in
a
most
methodical
and
reasonable
manner
it
has
been
admitted
by
many
a
traveler
that
to
shoot
a
monkey
was
too
like
murder
they
could
not
do
it
would
that
every
farmer
in
the
land
had
the
same
feeling
with
reference
to
the
owls
for
the
same
reason
holds
good
only
to
a
less
extent
it
is
true
that
we
know
very
little
about
the
various
cries
of
owls
but
every
country
lad
at
least
knows
that
the
bird
s
utterances
are
not
merely
slight
variations
of
a
typical
hoot
or
the
towhit
towhoo
of
the
poets
well
i
remember
how
evening
after
evening
when
in
camp
in
southern
ohio
the
great
horned
owls
made
night
melancholy
rather
than
hideous
by
their
sonorous
hoohoohoo
at
first
afar
off
and
then
nearer
and
clearer
sounded
their
incessant
call
as
flitting
from
one
tall
sycamore
to
another
they
slowly
approached
the
red
glare
of
the
campfire
their
hooting
varied
not
a
whit
but
merely
grew
more
distinct
and
for
long
i
thought
them
capable
of
no
other
utterance
but
how
great
an
error
this
was
evident
when
at
last
one
of
these
huge
birds
perched
in
the
oak
that
sheltered
my
tent
the
melancholy
hoohoohoo
was
the
same
but
with
this
were
a
host
of
minor
notes
and
these
were
once
followed
by
a
series
of
explosive
illtempered
ejaculations
when
the
little
red
owls
that
had
their
home
in
this
same
oak
scolded
without
ceasing
at
the
intrusion
i
can
liken
the
hubbub
to
nothing
but
the
subdued
clamor
of
excited
geese
in
like
manner
i
was
scolded
by
the
little
owl
on
the
meadow
hickory
the
moonlit
september
night
on
the
bluff
of
brush
creek
was
vividly
recalled
owls
need
but
to
be
more
closely
studied
and
if
in
confinement
to
be
treated
with
kindness
and
attended
by
one
person
to
demonstrate
that
all
the
wisdom
seeming
to
lurk
behind
their
expressive
faces
is
really
there
in
matters
of
animal
intelligence
i
know
that
i
am
heterodox
for
i
give
the
crow
prominence
equal
to
the
parrot
and
strongly
doubt
if
owls
should
stand
much
behind
them
a
hidden
highway
a
wide
tract
of
meadows
that
skirt
the
river
near
my
home
and
upon
which
much
wealth
and
labor
have
been
expended
in
years
past
was
the
abode
of
desolation
in
the
eyes
of
the
sturdy
settlers
two
hundred
years
ago
and
so
treacherous
the
footing
in
every
direction
so
the
record
runs
that
the
hunted
bears
and
deer
would
come
to
a
stand
rather
than
plunge
headlong
into
the
trackless
waste
with
proper
caution
the
tract
was
finally
explored
mapped
and
ditched
and
now
there
is
small
chance
of
disaster
unless
the
rambler
is
culpably
negligent
i
hold
that
one
should
think
kindly
of
a
ditch
the
commonly
imputed
repulsiveness
of
such
a
waterway
is
more
often
wanting
than
present
and
nearly
all
that
i
have
seen
have
teemed
with
interesting
life
what
are
the
brooks
indeed
that
turn
a
poet
s
head
but
nature
s
own
ditches
as
to
those
of
man
s
creation
they
need
but
a
little
time
and
they
will
assume
every
function
of
a
natural
watercourse
as
i
stood
recently
upon
rising
ground
overlooking
a
pasture
meadow
that
was
brown
as
a
nut
with
its
carpet
of
dead
grass
i
noticed
a
long
straight
line
of
weedlike
growths
still
showing
a
tinge
of
green
as
if
the
frost
had
spared
a
narrow
strip
of
the
exposed
tract
viewing
it
from
other
points
it
was
evident
that
a
ditch
had
once
been
dug
where
these
ranker
grasses
grew
and
through
long
neglect
it
had
finally
been
choked
with
weeds
and
almost
obliterated
it
was
a
delightful
discovery
armed
with
a
spade
a
hoe
and
sundry
tools
of
greater
or
less
efficiency
i
set
out
to
explore
this
onetime
watercourse
thinking
it
child
s
play
to
move
tons
of
matted
weeds
and
mud
how
much
or
how
little
i
accomplished
it
matters
not
but
the
fierce
onslaught
of
unreasoning
enthusiasm
broke
in
the
door
of
a
zoölogical
el
dorado
jetsam
and
flotsam
from
the
yearly
freshets
showers
of
windtossed
autumn
leaves
a
forest
of
rank
growths
that
revel
in
the
mud
all
had
added
their
quota
unchecked
to
the
baneful
work
of
damming
the
little
stream
which
finally
had
been
shut
from
view
but
as
it
proved
not
wholly
overcome
a
narrow
tubelike
channel
still
remained
with
the
mud
below
and
upon
each
side
almost
as
yielding
as
the
water
itself
here
fish
turtles
and
creeping
things
innumerable
not
only
lived
but
wended
their
darksome
way
from
the
open
ditch
not
far
off
to
the
basins
of
the
sparkling
springs
at
the
hillfoot
i
had
discovered
a
hidden
highway
a
busy
thoroughfare
that
teemed
with
active
life
except
with
those
forms
of
life
that
by
their
construction
are
solely
adapted
to
a
subterranean
existence
as
the
earthworm
or
to
a
fixed
one
as
the
oyster
we
commonly
associate
our
familiar
forms
of
wild
animals
with
unlimited
freedom
of
movement
and
suppose
that
they
have
the
wide
world
before
them
to
wander
where
they
list
and
again
that
of
creatures
as
high
in
the
scale
as
fishes
and
upward
the
supposition
is
that
in
proportion
to
their
freedom
of
movement
are
their
chances
of
escape
when
pursued
now
these
like
many
another
common
impression
are
true
in
a
general
way
but
fairly
bristle
with
exceptions
for
instance
there
are
many
extremely
sluggish
fishes
yet
what
creatures
are
more
agile
and
swift
than
the
minnows
in
our
brooks
and
there
are
fishes
that
can
walk
on
the
mud
with
their
bodies
entirely
out
of
the
water
dr
gunther
tells
us
that
the
barramunda
is
said
to
be
in
the
habit
of
going
on
land
or
at
least
on
mudflats
and
this
assertion
appears
to
be
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
it
is
provided
with
a
lung
it
is
also
said
to
make
a
grunting
noise
which
may
be
heard
at
night
for
some
distance
so
far
australia
and
now
what
of
new
jersey
mudflats
and
the
fishes
that
frequent
them
as
i
continued
to
explore
the
hidden
highway
of
snakes
turtles
and
fishes
i
found
in
almost
every
spadeful
of
mud
and
matted
weeds
one
or
more
brownblack
fishes
that
were
as
much
at
home
as
ever
an
earthworm
in
the
firmer
soil
bluntheaded
cylindrical
thickset
and
strongly
finned
these
fishes
were
built
to
overcome
many
an
obstacle
that
would
prove
insuperable
to
almost
any
other
how
indeed
they
burrowed
even
in
soft
mud
is
not
readily
explained
that
they
do
advance
headforemost
into
such
a
trackless
mass
is
unquestionable
how
long
these
mudfish
tarry
in
such
spots
i
can
not
say
but
during
the
longdry
summer
this
onetime
ditch
must
be
almost
as
dry
as
dust
and
then
probably
it
is
quite
forsaken
but
their
powers
of
endurance
may
be
underestimated
of
the
african
lepidosiren
dr
gunther
remarks
during
the
dry
season
specimens
living
in
shallow
waters
which
periodically
dry
up
form
a
cavity
in
the
mud
the
inside
of
which
they
line
with
a
protecting
capsule
of
mucus
and
from
which
they
emerge
again
when
the
rains
refill
the
pools
inhabited
by
them
while
they
remain
in
this
torpid
state
of
existence
the
clay
balls
containing
them
are
frequently
dug
out
and
if
the
capsules
are
not
broken
the
fishes
imbedded
in
them
can
be
transported
to
europe
and
released
by
being
immersed
in
slightly
tepid
water
the
many
mudfishes
that
i
tossed
upon
the
dead
grass
had
clearly
no
liking
for
an
atmospheric
bath
and
floundered
about
in
a
typical
fishlike
fashion
but
not
for
long
finding
no
open
water
near
they
became
quiet
at
once
when
by
chance
they
fell
into
some
little
cavity
of
the
mud
masses
from
which
the
water
had
not
drained
all
such
fortunate
fishes
seemed
quite
at
ease
and
remained
motionless
where
their
good
luck
had
brought
them
but
the
moment
i
attempted
to
pick
them
up
they
twisted
like
eels
upon
their
muddy
beds
and
buried
themselves
headforemost
with
a
rapidity
that
was
simply
marvelous
this
perhaps
is
what
the
reader
would
expect
but
it
struck
me
as
a
little
strange
because
when
i
startled
others
of
these
fishes
as
they
rested
among
the
weeds
or
on
the
sand
of
the
open
ditches
they
usually
gave
a
twist
of
the
tail
that
dug
a
pit
in
a
twinkling
and
in
this
the
fishes
sank
tailforemost
when
in
the
mud
these
curious
minnows
can
only
feel
their
way
and
if
they
procure
any
food
at
all
at
such
a
time
it
can
only
be
such
objects
as
come
directly
in
contact
with
their
mouths
but
how
different
is
it
when
these
same
fishes
are
in
open
water
they
are
expert
flycatchers
then
and
capture
many
an
insect
that
would
be
lost
to
a
trout
or
chub
they
have
not
to
wait
for
flies
to
fall
upon
the
surface
but
seize
those
that
happen
to
alight
upon
overhanging
blades
of
grass
or
any
projecting
twig
the
distance
that
they
will
leap
above
the
water
is
remarkable
the
spring
being
preceded
by
a
withdrawal
from
the
object
and
a
slight
sigmoid
curvature
of
the
body
involving
i
suppose
the
same
principle
as
that
of
a
short
run
before
jumping
mud
minnows
two
inches
in
length
which
i
kept
in
an
aquarium
were
proved
capable
of
leaping
above
the
water
a
distance
equal
to
twice
their
length
but
others
much
larger
could
not
or
would
not
leap
so
far
so
far
as
my
own
observations
extend
exhibitions
of
this
leaping
from
the
water
to
seize
insects
are
not
often
witnessed
and
it
was
my
aquarium
studies
that
led
me
to
watch
these
fishes
closely
when
in
the
muddy
ponds
and
ditches
once
when
so
engaged
i
saw
the
following
one
of
these
minnows
little
more
than
an
inch
in
length
sighted
an
insect
at
the
same
moment
that
it
was
seen
by
a
huge
female
minnow
more
than
thrice
the
other
s
length
the
little
fellow
had
all
the
advantage
however
as
it
was
much
nearer
the
fly
and
at
the
proper
instant
away
it
leaped
caught
the
insect
and
sank
back
but
not
to
the
water
that
hungry
ogress
was
willing
to
be
fed
by
proxy
as
it
were
and
permitting
the
little
minnow
to
swallow
the
fly
she
promptly
swallowed
both
tiring
of
the
fish
at
last
and
having
long
since
wearied
of
reopening
the
ditch
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
other
creatures
that
i
had
unearthed
among
them
were
four
species
of
turtles
each
represented
by
several
individuals
one
of
these
was
the
muhlenberg
tortoise
the
rarest
of
american
chelonians
probably
just
here
over
a
few
hundred
acres
of
the
delaware
meadows
there
are
more
of
them
than
in
the
whole
world
besides
the
fact
of
their
great
rarity
makes
them
the
more
interesting
to
a
naturalist
but
today
they
proved
exceedingly
stupid
far
more
so
than
the
others
which
in
a
mild
way
resented
my
interference
and
pranced
over
the
dead
grass
quite
energetically
reaching
the
nearest
open
ditch
in
good
time
and
to
my
surprise
they
all
seemed
governed
by
a
sense
of
direction
they
went
but
little
if
any
out
of
their
way
not
so
with
the
muhlenbergs
they
seemed
dazed
for
a
long
time
and
finally
after
much
looking
about
they
started
the
four
together
in
the
wrong
direction
and
would
have
had
a
weary
journey
to
reach
open
water
again
and
again
i
faced
them
about
but
they
would
not
go
as
i
wished
such
obstinate
turtles
i
had
never
seen
before
and
i
almost
felt
convinced
that
they
were
impelled
by
some
common
impression
very
different
from
that
which
actuated
the
others
as
is
often
the
case
i
was
all
at
sea
in
my
efforts
to
interpret
their
purposes
letting
them
alone
they
waddled
through
the
grass
for
a
few
yards
only
when
they
reached
little
pools
that
met
all
their
needs
about
what
time
the
summer
birds
have
arrived
and
goldenclub
blooms
in
the
tidewater
creeks
gilding
the
mudflats
that
have
so
long
been
bare
the
turtles
or
three
at
least
of
our
eight
aquatic
species
begin
sunning
themselves
as
it
is
usually
said
but
they
continue
the
practice
through
rainy
and
cloudy
days
every
projecting
stump
stranded
fencerail
or
bit
of
lumber
capable
of
bearing
any
weight
is
sure
to
be
the
restingplace
of
one
and
if
there
is
room
of
a
dozen
turtles
i
once
counted
seventeen
on
a
fencerail
and
thirtynine
on
a
raftlog
that
the
freshets
had
stranded
on
the
meadows
why
at
such
a
time
should
these
creatures
be
so
timid
they
certainly
have
no
enemies
about
here
and
their
horny
shields
would
effectually
protect
them
if
fishing
mammals
like
the
mink
and
otter
should
acquire
aldermanic
tastes
and
yet
so
far
as
i
can
determine
by
experimentation
there
is
scarcely
an
animal
more
timid
than
the
painted
or
spotted
waterturtle
fear
with
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
is
a
contradiction
and
i
am
led
to
suggest
that
the
timidity
is
hereditary
something
over
two
centuries
ago
the
delaware
indians
hunted
and
fished
these
meadows
without
ceasing
and
there
can
still
be
gathered
the
bones
of
such
animals
as
they
ate
from
the
ashes
of
their
campfires
turtlebones
almost
equal
in
number
those
of
our
larger
fishes
have
we
a
clew
here
to
the
mystery
do
the
turtles
of
today
inherit
a
fear
of
man
this
may
seem
an
absurdity
or
verging
toward
it
but
it
is
not
a
critic
at
my
elbow
a
plague
upon
their
race
reminds
me
that
i
once
commented
upon
the
tameness
of
the
turtles
at
lake
hopatcong
in
northern
new
jersey
and
adds
aggravatingly
that
that
region
was
a
favorite
resort
of
the
indians
if
this
stricture
holds
then
i
can
suggest
for
the
delaware
valley
turtles
that
it
is
a
fear
born
with
each
generation
of
the
railway
cars
that
hourly
rumble
over
an
elastic
roadbed
and
cause
the
whole
meadows
to
tremble
terror
may
seize
the
turtles
when
they
feel
their
world
shake
beneath
them
and
this
disturbance
they
may
attribute
to
man
s
presence
this
is
not
so
rational
and
i
do
know
that
turtles
distinguish
between
men
and
domestic
animals
they
are
not
afraid
of
cows
of
this
i
have
abundant
proof
although
i
do
not
accept
as
true
the
remark
of
miles
overfield
afeard
o
cattle
not
much
why
i
ve
seen
tortles
line
a
cow
s
back
when
she
stood
flankdeep
in
the
water
i
had
noticed
that
the
narrow
tubelike
channel
of
the
obliterated
ditch
grew
less
defined
as
i
dug
in
one
direction
so
i
paced
off
a
rod
in
advance
and
made
a
crosssection
here
it
could
not
be
traced
but
a
halfdozen
very
small
openings
circular
in
outline
could
be
seen
and
through
some
of
these
the
water
slowly
trickled
i
found
a
single
molecricket
and
attribute
to
it
and
others
of
its
kind
these
little
tunnels
certainly
more
persistent
burrowers
do
not
exist
and
i
have
known
them
to
cause
mischief
to
a
milldam
which
was
attributed
to
muskrats
they
are
says
prof
riley
the
true
moles
of
the
insect
world
and
make
tortuous
galleries
destroying
everything
that
comes
in
their
way
cutting
through
roots
and
eating
the
fine
underground
twigs
as
well
as
the
worms
and
grubs
which
they
meet
with
during
their
burrowings
a
volume
would
not
suffice
to
enumerate
the
invertebrate
or
insectlike
life
that
lived
in
this
dark
passageway
beneath
the
sod
nor
do
we
wonder
at
finding
such
low
forms
groping
in
utter
darkness
but
why
higher
animals
that
are
found
and
far
more
frequently
in
the
open
air
and
sunlit
waters
should
delight
to
crowd
these
same
gloomy
quarters
is
a
problem
not
so
easily
solved
we
are
left
to
conjecture
and
invariably
do
so
and
are
often
overwhelmed
when
an
army
of
objections
confront
our
theories
notwithstanding
this
there
is
a
pleasure
in
reopening
an
obliterated
ditch
in
letting
in
the
light
upon
a
hidden
highway
for
by
so
doing
we
also
let
in
light
upon
ourselves
seeing
with
clearer
vision
the
wonderful
world
about
us
weathercocks
during
a
sixmile
drive
recently
i
passed
by
eleven
barns
upon
nine
of
which
were
weathercocks
no
two
i
am
positive
pointed
in
the
same
direction
and
only
one
was
very
near
to
being
right
such
at
least
was
the
conclusion
testing
them
by
the
compass
the
movement
of
the
clouds
and
the
wetted
fingers
which
my
companion
and
myself
held
up
alas
i
and
my
friend
were
at
odds
so
far
as
the
last
test
was
concerned
it
is
little
wonder
that
weatherprophets
are
so
apt
to
be
at
loggerheads
if
the
direction
of
the
wind
admits
of
discussion
could
the
various
shapes
of
these
weathercocks
have
had
to
do
with
the
matter
assuming
that
the
nine
we
saw
were
in
working
order
if
so
what
is
a
reliable
pattern
i
remember
a
remarkable
wooden
indian
with
one
foot
raised
as
if
the
fellow
was
hopping
and
with
an
impossible
bow
so
held
as
to
indicate
that
an
arrow
was
about
to
be
discharged
this
wooden
man
obediently
twirled
to
and
fro
in
every
passing
breeze
but
you
were
left
in
a
quandary
as
to
whether
the
wind
s
direction
was
indicated
by
the
uplifted
foot
or
by
the
bow
and
arrow
for
they
pointed
in
opposite
directions
that
is
the
merit
of
the
vane
once
said
the
owner
of
the
barn
over
which
this
shapeless
sculpture
towered
you
can
use
your
own
judgment
of
the
weathercocks
seen
on
our
ride
there
were
one
deer
two
fishes
three
arrows
a
wild
goose
and
two
gilded
horses
at
full
gallop
only
the
wild
goose
told
the
truth
or
almost
told
it
now
as
each
farmer
judges
the
weather
of
the
day
by
the
direction
of
the
wind
think
of
bringing
the
owners
of
these
nine
differing
weathercocks
together
each
puts
implicit
faith
in
his
own
vane
and
we
all
know
what
subject
is
first
broached
when
two
or
twenty
men
are
gathered
together
something
like
this
would
be
the
classification
of
the
unhappy
nine
two
positive
clearweather
folk
two
hopefully
ditto
and
five
that
predicted
rain
before
night
put
it
in
another
way
four
men
would
think
if
they
did
not
call
five
men
fools
and
all
being
equally
obstinate
there
would
be
the
same
division
whatever
was
discussed
so
at
least
the
world
wags
in
one
section
of
our
country
there
is
much
more
stress
laid
upon
the
direction
of
the
wind
in
this
matter
of
the
weather
than
is
warranted
by
the
facts
those
deadly
statistics
that
are
gall
and
wormwood
to
the
weatherwise
prove
this
even
a
northeast
wind
may
blow
for
three
days
without
one
drop
of
rain
when
this
happens
we
hear
of
a
dry
storm
curious
name
for
bright
clear
days
perhaps
with
a
cloudless
sky
that
by
virtue
of
the
cool
breeze
from
the
east
are
wellnigh
perfect
or
we
are
told
that
the
moon
held
back
the
water
and
the
next
storm
will
be
doubly
wet
ay
even
that
jupiter
or
mars
had
a
finger
in
the
pie
and
disturbed
the
proper
order
of
wind
and
rain
it
is
painful
to
think
that
so
many
thousands
still
believe
that
not
only
ourselves
but
even
the
poor
weather
is
under
the
domination
of
the
moon
and
stars
how
little
the
planets
must
have
to
do
to
trouble
themselves
about
our
little
globe
i
don
t
like
to
see
that
star
so
shiny
a
wiseacre
recently
remarked
pointing
to
venus
it
s
a
bad
sign
but
of
what
the
simpleton
could
not
or
would
not
tell
and
as
to
comets
or
even
meteors
if
they
are
more
numerous
than
usual
they
make
hundreds
miserable
the
truth
is
that
the
valuable
treatises
upon
weather
the
outcome
of
patient
study
and
scientific
method
still
go
abegging
while
the
crudities
of
weathercranks
find
ready
credence
and
the
day
is
still
distant
i
believe
when
it
will
be
otherwise
what
can
not
be
said
of
weathercocks
as
symbols
of
disappointment
to
how
many
a
countrybred
boy
has
fallen
the
unhappy
lot
of
being
stormbound
when
a
fishing
frolic
has
been
planned
my
initial
grief
was
that
an
april
day
proved
stormy
that
should
have
been
clear
as
crystal
the
time
the
tide
the
moon
all
the
essential
and
unessential
requirements
of
shadfishing
in
crosswicks
creek
were
favorable
and
tomorrow
saturday
i
was
to
be
one
of
the
party
a
mere
onlooker
to
be
sure
but
what
mattered
that
i
had
heard
of
shadfishing
all
winter
long
and
now
being
seven
years
old
was
allowed
to
be
one
of
the
party
o
tedious
friday
would
school
never
be
dismissed
o
endless
friday
night
had
the
sun
forgotten
to
rise
and
all
saturday
it
rained
that
horrid
wooden
indian
of
which
we
have
heard
fairly
grinned
with
fiendish
delight
as
it
faced
the
leaden
east
and
received
the
driving
rain
with
open
arms
it
never
moved
an
inch
from
dawn
to
sunset
yes
once
it
moved
during
a
lull
i
slipped
outofdoors
and
bribed
an
older
lad
to
stone
the
obstinate
vane
one
sharp
pebble
mutilated
the
headdress
and
sent
the
indian
spinning
about
regardless
of
wind
or
weather
but
when
at
rest
again
the
face
was
looking
eastward
o
pestiferous
weathercocks
that
point
to
the
east
on
saturday
why
vanes
should
have
been
so
generally
shaped
like
a
crowing
chanticleer
as
to
give
rise
to
the
more
common
name
of
weathercocks
is
not
easily
determined
of
a
few
explanations
seen
or
heard
none
had
a
modicum
of
common
sense
when
and
where
too
the
first
vane
was
set
up
whether
cock
or
arrow
is
an
unsolvable
problem
possibly
it
is
necessary
to
grope
backward
into
prehistoric
times
although
rütimeyer
does
not
give
the
common
fowl
as
one
of
the
birds
found
in
the
débris
beneath
the
ancient
lakedwellings
of
switzerland
it
may
be
added
too
that
chickens
are
not
weather
prophets
as
are
geese
and
peacocks
notwithstanding
they
figure
somewhat
conspicuously
in
all
animal
weatherlore
and
have
done
so
since
b
c
if
not
earlier
aratus
in
his
diosemeia
or
prognostics
for
instance
claims
that
a
cock
when
unusually
restless
or
noisy
foretells
a
coming
storm
and
this
nonsense
is
believed
today
by
a
fair
proportion
of
our
rural
population
of
course
modifications
of
this
are
wellnigh
innumerable
and
one
of
them
when
a
small
boy
i
found
useful
if
a
cock
came
to
the
open
kitchen
door
company
was
coming
such
was
the
firm
conviction
of
a
trio
of
aunts
who
ruled
the
household
now
companycoming
meant
pie
or
pudding
and
to
a
small
boy
this
means
a
great
deal
acting
upon
it
the
crowing
of
a
cock
was
faithfully
practiced
in
the
woods
and
then
while
my
brother
singled
out
a
rooster
and
drove
it
to
the
door
i
crowed
lustily
from
behind
the
lilacbushes
and
the
ruse
brought
pie
and
pudding
more
than
once
but
not
too
often
to
weaken
these
credulous
women
s
faith
i
have
mentioned
a
dry
storm
with
the
wind
due
east
there
was
one
such
at
the
close
of
the
first
week
in
april
the
air
was
exasperatingly
chilly
even
the
frogs
in
the
marshes
were
silent
and
humanity
was
illnatured
and
despondent
while
standing
on
the
lee
side
of
an
old
oak
i
chanced
upon
a
glorious
weathercock
one
that
would
shame
the
despairing
thoughts
of
any
reasonable
man
that
prince
of
winter
birds
a
crested
tit
sat
long
upon
a
leafless
twig
facing
the
cruel
east
wind
sat
there
and
sang
clinging
as
for
dear
life
to
the
swaying
branch
t
sweet
here
t
sweet
here
the
burden
of
its
song
the
everhopeful
story
of
this
incomparable
bird
what
if
the
east
wind
did
blow
was
there
not
here
and
there
a
trembling
violet
in
the
woods
a
filmy
veil
of
white
where
the
whitlow
grasses
bloomed
a
flashing
of
the
maple
s
ruddy
fire
where
the
fitful
sunshine
fell
all
these
gave
promise
to
the
bravehearted
bird
of
spring
as
coming
if
not
quite
here
let
me
take
the
hint
give
me
just
such
a
weathercock
for
each
day
of
the
year
appleblossoms
during
the
whole
of
april
the
old
appletrees
in
the
lane
are
closely
watched
and
not
without
a
deal
of
impatience
too
will
they
blossom
freely
is
asked
almost
daily
and
what
a
world
of
anticipation
hinges
upon
this
wondrous
wealth
of
bloom
to
linger
in
the
lane
when
the
old
trees
are
flowerladen
when
the
air
is
heavy
with
a
honeyed
scent
when
the
bees
low
hum
fills
the
long
leafy
arch
and
every
summer
bird
is
happiest
this
is
an
experience
too
valued
to
be
lost
one
that
sweetens
life
until
spring
shall
come
again
the
trees
are
old
they
have
more
than
rounded
a
full
halfcentury
and
now
bend
with
the
weight
of
many
winters
they
are
ragged
rather
than
rugged
yet
game
to
the
last
are
again
sturdily
upholding
to
the
bright
sunshine
of
merry
may
mornings
a
marvelous
wealth
of
bloom
as
seen
from
the
crests
of
the
rolling
hills
beyond
this
double
row
of
trees
recalls
a
huge
snowbank
such
as
has
often
filled
the
lane
in
winter
recalls
such
as
i
have
seen
at
sunrise
when
they
were
tinged
with
a
rosy
light
in
winter
i
have
often
thought
of
the
blossoming
trees
in
may
now
i
recall
the
lifeless
beauty
of
midwinter
snows
in
winter
the
beauty
of
the
marble
statue
held
me
now
the
joy
of
a
living
form
but
appleblossoms
bear
well
a
close
inspection
better
than
a
comprehensive
view
from
the
neighboring
fields
is
to
draw
near
to
walk
beneath
and
beside
them
to
linger
in
their
scented
shade
time
after
time
until
now
a
shadow
of
doubt
has
crossed
our
paths
when
we
gathered
early
bloom
the
wail
of
winter
winds
still
sounded
in
every
passing
breeze
although
we
plucked
violets
from
the
greensward
beneath
budding
trees
too
often
in
april
we
are
overconfident
but
there
is
little
danger
of
disaster
now
appleblossoms
are
the
first
assuring
gift
of
fruitful
summer
grim
winter
is
powerless
now
to
wound
us
tricksy
april
can
play
no
heartless
pranks
what
summer
sound
is
more
suggestive
than
the
hum
of
bees
certainly
not
even
the
song
of
the
returning
birds
as
i
look
among
the
flowerladen
boughs
above
me
i
can
see
not
only
the
bees
from
the
hive
the
true
honeygatherers
but
burly
humblebees
go
whizzing
through
the
rosy
labyrinths
or
dipping
down
to
a
level
with
my
upturned
face
threaten
fierce
vengeance
if
i
draw
too
near
again
and
again
they
come
one
after
another
and
each
time
i
think
a
little
nearer
yet
never
despite
their
bluster
venturing
to
sting
to
be
sure
i
make
no
threats
in
return
nor
run
away
and
so
my
bold
front
may
deter
them
for
they
really
seem
to
read
our
thoughts
at
times
not
so
their
cousins
the
autumn
wasps
they
brook
nothing
i
remember
one
october
morning
throwing
a
stone
at
and
bringing
down
an
apple
upon
which
as
it
happened
a
wasp
was
feeding
at
the
time
the
ruffled
insect
came
the
first
to
the
ground
and
not
only
promptly
stung
me
when
i
stooped
to
pick
up
the
apple
but
followed
me
across
the
lawn
into
the
house
and
darted
most
viciously
at
my
face
time
after
time
when
the
old
beebench
with
its
halfdozen
rude
boxes
stood
by
the
gooseberry
hedge
in
my
grandfather
s
garden
the
lane
when
the
trees
were
in
blossom
was
as
i
recall
that
time
even
more
thronged
by
bees
than
now
and
the
mighty
humming
of
their
wings
forcibly
suggested
the
rapid
flow
of
water
as
the
roar
of
the
milldam
after
a
heavy
rain
so
great
a
volume
of
sound
indeed
was
there
all
day
that
the
night
was
silent
in
comparison
so
ran
my
thoughts
so
returned
vague
visions
of
past
years
as
i
lingered
in
the
lane
today
but
after
all
may
it
not
be
that
i
rather
than
the
conditions
have
changed
how
often
have
i
longed
to
hear
the
songs
to
see
the
bloom
to
catch
the
fragrant
breeze
that
held
me
spellbound
when
a
boy
and
all
these
later
fleeting
years
i
have
hoped
for
them
in
vain
with
the
appleblossoms
come
the
birds
nests
and
who
that
has
lived
in
the
country
knew
not
of
a
robin
s
home
in
some
old
apple
tree
and
did
ever
a
bird
sing
merrier
strains
than
this
same
robin
at
sunrise
or
even
better
as
the
sun
shone
forth
again
after
a
shower
the
rapid
roll
of
his
rejoicing
as
he
perched
upon
his
hometree
s
loftiest
branch
it
is
the
rule
apparently
that
very
old
appletrees
have
great
hollows
in
them
if
the
entire
trunk
is
not
a
shell
then
here
and
there
where
branches
have
decayed
and
fallen
caves
of
considerable
depth
are
found
and
how
quickly
wild
life
tenants
such
snug
quarters
a
few
of
our
mammals
many
birds
several
snakes
besides
one
species
of
salamander
and
the
treetoad
have
been
found
at
home
in
hollow
appletrees
if
therefore
such
a
tree
stands
not
too
near
a
dwelling
its
occupants
may
epitomize
the
fauna
of
a
farm
although
after
a
rain
i
have
found
pools
of
water
in
old
trees
there
were
no
fish
and
these
need
not
be
looked
for
unless
some
venturous
mudminnow
that
now
can
work
its
way
over
narrow
mudflats
shall
in
time
take
to
climbing
trees
as
does
a
perch
that
is
well
known
to
ichthyologists
in
daldorf
says
dr
gunther
in
a
memoir
mentions
that
in
he
had
himself
taken
an
anabas
in
the
act
of
ascending
a
palmtree
which
grew
near
a
pond
the
fish
had
reached
the
height
of
five
feet
above
the
water
and
was
going
still
higher
when
i
peer
into
the
hollow
trees
in
the
lane
here
at
home
i
only
expect
to
find
birds
and
seldom
have
been
disappointed
except
so
far
as
the
english
sparrow
has
ousted
the
oldtime
bluebird
it
is
exasperating
to
think
that
the
latter
have
been
crowded
out
and
now
gather
in
the
more
retired
woodland
areas
to
breed
what
song
better
fitted
with
appleblossoms
of
a
bright
may
morning
than
that
of
the
bluebird
and
now
we
have
instead
the
illtempered
chirping
of
an
alien
sparrow
but
appleblossoms
are
none
the
less
beautiful
because
of
the
unfortunate
changes
meddlesome
men
have
brought
about
they
hold
their
ancient
glory
still
and
yield
as
of
old
that
rich
rare
fragrance
which
never
cloys
surely
no
one
ever
walked
among
rows
of
blooming
appletrees
and
said
it
is
too
sweet
not
even
of
our
native
wild
crabapple
is
this
lightly
to
be
said
and
it
is
unquestionably
of
deeper
tints
and
richer
fragrance
than
the
average
cultivated
tree
i
know
of
one
exception
at
the
end
of
the
row
upon
one
side
of
the
lane
there
stands
a
vigorous
appletree
it
has
more
the
appearance
of
the
trees
in
the
forest
than
of
those
in
an
orchard
and
if
its
fruit
is
not
quite
so
small
as
that
of
the
wild
crab
it
is
but
one
remove
therefrom
this
tree
rests
its
glory
upon
its
blossoms
and
well
it
may
upon
these
go
out
all
its
strength
offering
therefore
beauty
to
the
eye
rather
than
food
for
the
body
it
is
a
tree
with
a
history
perhaps
not
worth
relating
when
set
where
it
now
stands
it
appears
to
have
been
more
exposed
to
the
wind
than
its
companions
and
was
twice
blown
down
when
last
put
back
my
grandfather
remarked
rather
impatiently
now
stay
at
least
if
you
never
bear
an
apple
and
the
tree
stood
still
stands
what
of
the
fruit
it
bears
tough
wrinkled
as
a
toad
and
sour
it
is
said
that
even
the
pigs
refuse
it
squealing
in
disgust
when
by
mistake
they
crunch
it
so
if
my
grandfather
s
muttered
curse
fell
upon
the
fruit
the
tree
revenged
itself
by
adding
beauty
to
its
blossoms
and
today
though
twice
hoarfrost
has
chilled
the
open
buds
if
judged
by
the
eye
alone
it
stands
among
a
goodly
number
brightest
of
them
all
the
building
of
the
nest
those
who
have
lived
a
part
or
all
of
their
lives
in
the
country
know
from
observation
while
those
who
have
spent
their
days
in
town
know
from
hearsay
or
books
that
a
very
large
proportion
of
our
birds
remain
with
us
only
from
april
to
october
or
later
while
yet
others
on
the
approach
of
winter
come
from
the
north
to
escape
the
rigors
of
an
arctic
climate
and
a
considerable
number
of
most
interesting
species
are
strictly
resident
this
striking
feature
of
bird
life
is
by
no
means
confined
to
north
america
and
perhaps
it
is
in
most
respects
more
suggestive
as
observed
on
other
continents
however
this
may
be
it
is
so
noticeable
an
occurrence
on
our
atlantic
seaboard
that
the
coming
and
going
of
this
or
that
bird
has
passed
into
our
folklore
and
more
than
one
weather
proverb
is
based
upon
the
arrival
or
departure
of
wildgeese
fishhawks
and
the
swallows
although
very
much
more
is
now
known
of
these
seasonal
movements
of
our
birds
than
was
but
a
few
years
ago
it
is
not
yet
and
probably
never
will
be
possible
to
determine
the
law
of
migration
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
springtide
northward
and
autumnal
southward
flight
of
our
inland
birds
has
not
that
element
of
regularity
as
to
dates
or
method
that
has
been
so
frequently
insisted
upon
they
come
and
go
but
beyond
this
we
can
be
sure
of
nothing
from
year
to
year
sooner
or
later
our
warblers
thrushes
and
flycatchers
come
as
the
world
grows
green
sooner
or
later
as
the
meadows
and
upland
grow
drearily
brown
these
same
birds
depart
but
if
as
to
birds
collectively
we
can
not
be
positive
in
this
matter
of
the
time
place
and
manner
of
migration
we
can
feel
moderately
confident
of
a
return
summer
after
summer
of
certain
individual
birds
if
they
have
escaped
life
s
perils
in
the
mean
while
says
dr
robert
brown
birds
of
passage
the
individual
swallow
it
is
now
ascertained
returns
from
the
canaries
or
north
africa
to
the
very
spot
on
which
it
built
its
little
mud
mansion
the
previous
summer
and
according
to
the
observations
of
the
celebrated
jenner
marked
birds
were
caught
at
their
old
nests
every
year
for
three
successive
seasons
i
find
the
home
hillside
luxuriantly
green
today
although
the
first
week
of
may
has
not
yet
passed
even
the
tardy
oaks
are
well
in
leaf
and
from
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
woods
and
fields
there
floats
the
merry
song
of
a
nesting
bird
among
them
are
there
any
friends
of
a
year
ago
surely
i
recognize
one
long
before
sunrise
on
the
morning
of
april
th
i
heard
a
loud
chatter
near
my
chamber
windows
there
was
no
mistaking
the
creature
that
uttered
it
and
i
knew
although
it
had
rained
violently
all
the
night
and
was
still
storming
that
the
housewren
had
come
back
to
his
old
castle
on
the
post
i
peeped
through
the
shutter
as
soon
as
there
was
sufficient
light
and
there
stood
the
little
bird
braving
a
keen
east
wind
and
singing
with
all
his
might
now
the
day
before
there
were
no
wrens
near
not
one
was
skulking
along
the
hillside
looking
for
nesting
sites
had
there
by
chance
been
even
a
straggler
ahead
of
time
as
is
not
uncommon
with
many
migratory
birds
it
would
have
been
heard
if
not
seen
for
wrens
are
never
silent
for
a
day
if
indeed
for
any
five
minutes
of
it
unless
asleep
therefore
i
am
confident
that
the
plucky
bird
that
i
saw
in
the
dawn
of
april
th
had
been
guided
by
the
prominent
landmarks
such
as
the
river
meadows
and
the
wooded
bluff
and
had
come
directly
to
his
home
of
the
past
summer
hastening
when
once
he
started
to
the
inconspicuous
box
that
is
perched
upon
a
pole
close
to
my
house
and
hidden
by
two
great
locusttrees
and
a
towering
wildcherry
no
stranger
wren
while
yet
it
was
dark
could
have
found
the
spot
and
proved
himself
so
promptly
at
home
for
early
that
same
day
while
yet
alone
the
bird
commenced
housecleaning
preparatory
to
the
one
great
event
of
the
coming
summer
nestbuilding
while
not
quite
true
that
all
worth
knowing
of
a
bird
is
centered
in
the
few
weeks
occupied
in
rearing
its
young
certainly
at
no
other
time
is
it
seen
to
the
same
advantage
every
faculty
is
quickened
then
and
all
that
a
bird
is
capable
of
effecting
is
apparent
something
more
important
than
foodgetting
commands
its
attention
and
reason
is
exercised
almost
if
not
quite
to
the
exclusion
of
instinct
for
the
nest
of
every
bird
must
meet
its
builder
s
peculiar
needs
and
is
not
fashioned
blindly
after
the
homes
of
its
ancestors
it
is
true
that
a
family
likeness
runs
through
the
nests
of
a
given
species
of
bird
but
to
say
of
a
deserted
one
in
autumn
this
or
that
bird
built
it
is
a
rash
procedure
not
every
bird
builds
a
nest
although
all
lay
eggs
and
as
has
been
intimated
all
nests
are
not
alike
perhaps
the
cupshaped
structure
built
of
twigs
and
lined
with
fine
grass
may
be
said
to
be
the
typical
form
but
many
are
the
modifications
of
this
simple
pattern
and
now
this
beautiful
may
morning
the
birds
are
building
not
here
and
there
a
sparrow
or
a
thrush
but
birds
of
many
kinds
and
building
everywhere
i
can
not
even
mention
them
by
name
or
my
article
would
run
into
a
catalogue
suffice
it
to
say
they
are
building
in
the
barn
and
on
it
in
my
house
and
down
in
the
chimney
under
the
floor
of
the
bridge
in
the
lane
is
a
nest
and
the
trees
shrubbery
and
bare
ground
are
all
occupied
there
is
now
a
nest
for
every
nook
and
corner
and
i
would
that
the
young
people
of
everywhere
were
my
guests
today
provided
they
would
live
up
to
the
law
i
long
ago
passed
for
my
own
government
eyes
on
hands
off
and
now
what
of
the
building
of
particular
nests
i
know
of
twenty
within
a
stone
sthrow
of
my
front
door
and
the
making
of
each
one
had
its
serious
as
well
as
comic
side
at
the
very
outset
a
conflict
of
interests
arose
on
account
of
some
bits
of
material
being
equally
valuable
in
the
minds
of
several
birds
and
when
an
oriole
a
wren
and
an
english
sparrow
wish
to
pull
at
the
frayed
end
of
a
rope
at
the
same
time
something
more
than
a
mere
ripple
of
excitement
is
likely
to
ensue
in
short
nestbuilding
brings
out
in
a
bird
not
only
all
its
belligerency
which
during
the
rest
of
the
year
is
dormant
but
a
great
deal
of
strategic
skill
as
well
for
many
a
time
i
have
seen
the
smaller
bird
succeed
through
cunning
in
outwitting
the
bully
that
depended
on
mere
strength
of
beak
and
claws
the
burden
of
each
bird
s
mind
in
spring
being
i
must
build
me
a
nest
let
us
follow
the
wakeful
wren
that
came
on
a
stormy
morning
to
his
old
home
he
evidently
was
sure
of
his
mate
and
was
for
four
days
ceaselessly
at
work
perhaps
he
found
odd
moments
when
he
could
eat
as
he
constantly
did
to
sing
but
never
a
leisurely
meal
was
his
i
am
very
sure
the
old
homestead
must
be
made
habitable
again
and
how
he
worked
all
the
old
rubbish
of
last
summer
was
pulled
from
the
box
and
none
of
it
taken
back
i
fancy
while
i
watched
the
busy
bird
two
days
after
his
arrival
i
recalled
an
occurrence
of
last
summer
and
wondered
if
there
might
be
a
repetition
of
it
with
my
aid
and
at
all
events
the
bird
s
movements
would
tend
to
show
whether
it
was
the
same
wren
or
not
so
i
placed
tempting
material
for
nestbuilding
on
a
piece
of
very
thin
board
and
set
it
afloat
in
a
huge
basin
it
was
directly
discovered
the
old
wren
was
looking
for
it
i
am
sure
now
but
last
year
s
tactics
were
not
repeated
as
a
whole
then
the
bird
alighted
on
the
strands
of
hemp
and
submerged
them
and
almost
itself
and
only
after
many
trials
hit
upon
the
plan
of
dipping
down
and
seizing
a
strand
while
on
the
wing
would
it
do
this
now
a
year
later
i
was
all
impatience
while
the
wren
flittered
nervously
about
the
basin
but
was
encouraged
by
its
contemplative
manner
at
last
it
attempted
to
alight
on
the
mass
and
i
felt
angry
at
its
stupidity
and
my
own
overconfidence
but
no
it
proved
only
to
be
an
attempt
last
year
s
experience
was
remembered
and
strand
after
strand
was
deftly
picked
up
while
the
bird
was
flying
i
am
confident
now
that
i
am
listening
while
i
write
to
the
very
wren
that
comforted
me
last
summer
while
some
of
our
birds
content
themselves
with
but
shallow
depressions
in
the
ground
and
many
others
place
together
so
few
sticks
and
these
illarranged
that
the
nest
might
readily
be
overlooked
there
is
one
bird
that
is
too
lazy
to
do
even
so
much
but
drops
an
egg
in
the
nest
of
another
bird
this
is
the
habit
too
of
the
european
cuckoo
but
our
cuckoos
are
nestbuilders
and
the
bird
to
which
i
have
referred
belongs
to
a
very
different
group
few
people
seem
to
know
it
at
all
and
yet
it
is
abundant
over
a
wide
range
of
country
and
has
a
dozen
names
mostly
meaningless
the
best
perhaps
of
them
is
cowpen
bird
a
name
derived
i
suppose
from
the
fact
that
the
bird
is
often
found
in
pastures
where
there
are
cattle
or
sheep
indeed
i
have
often
seen
them
standing
upon
the
backs
of
cows
and
sheep
catching
flies
i
presume
though
they
seem
to
be
quite
inactive
when
upon
such
a
perch
although
not
nestbuilders
they
have
something
to
do
with
the
building
of
nests
when
that
tireless
songster
the
redeyed
vireo
builds
its
pensile
nest
on
the
hillside
the
necessity
for
concealment
does
not
occur
to
the
bird
and
so
its
home
is
often
invaded
by
the
female
cowbird
and
a
single
egg
dropped
into
the
structure
as
soon
as
if
not
before
it
is
finished
sometimes
this
is
put
up
with
sometimes
not
i
have
many
times
found
nests
that
were
twostoried
the
intrusive
egg
being
of
course
in
the
basement
and
destroyed
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
bird
wit
of
which
i
know
a
vast
deal
is
taken
into
consideration
while
the
decision
is
being
reached
to
build
a
floor
over
the
obnoxious
egg
and
so
prevent
its
hatching
there
can
be
nothing
of
all
this
ascribed
to
instinct
for
then
all
such
eggs
would
be
destroyed
by
this
means
and
the
bird
become
extinct
on
the
other
hand
it
is
but
a
very
small
percentage
that
have
the
wit
or
courage
to
undertake
the
work
which
is
evidence
enough
that
of
a
given
species
of
bird
the
variation
in
intelligence
among
individuals
is
very
marked
this
indeed
we
see
on
every
hand
when
birds
are
building
particularly
noticeable
is
it
when
the
female
bird
stays
at
home
and
arranges
the
material
which
her
mate
brings
to
her
this
is
mere
drudgery
to
the
male
bird
and
too
often
worthless
bits
are
brought
which
the
toiling
builder
promptly
rejects
and
not
always
with
becoming
patience
either
she
speaks
her
mind
in
unmistakable
tones
and
if
not
heeded
after
the
second
or
third
scolding
open
war
is
declared
on
the
spot
followed
too
often
by
a
wreck
of
all
their
hopes
a
word
more
if
people
young
or
old
would
get
a
correct
knowledge
of
a
wild
bird
s
ways
would
know
what
is
meant
by
animal
intelligence
let
them
study
a
pair
of
nestbuilding
birds
while
they
are
at
work
let
them
draw
near
but
not
too
near
and
see
how
carefully
the
work
progresses
how
skillfully
many
a
difficulty
is
overcome
how
completely
the
finished
structure
meets
all
requirements
do
this
but
do
nothing
more
refrain
from
disturbing
the
timid
builders
abstain
from
robbing
them
when
their
work
is
done
by
gentleness
prove
yourselves
the
friends
of
birds
and
they
will
return
your
kindness
with
a
measure
heaped
up
and
overflowing
a
meadow
mudhole
the
least
suggestive
spot
in
the
world
to
most
people
is
a
mudhole
the
common
impression
seems
to
be
that
fish
avoid
it
that
frogs
and
birds
pass
it
by
and
plants
decline
to
cover
its
nakedness
this
like
a
great
many
other
common
impressions
is
really
very
wide
of
the
mark
if
the
water
be
not
unutterably
filthy
fish
will
condescend
to
tenant
the
shallow
depths
frogs
will
thrive
therein
bitterns
and
the
little
railbird
find
such
a
spot
attractive
and
many
an
aquatic
plant
grows
nowhere
else
so
vigorously
there
are
as
all
know
mudholes
that
are
but
blotchy
remnants
of
man
s
interference
mere
accidents
as
it
were
which
do
not
concern
us
and
also
those
deeper
scars
where
the
fair
face
of
the
landscape
has
been
wounded
severely
as
when
the
icegorged
river
bursts
its
proper
bounds
leaving
a
shallow
pool
in
my
pasture
meadow
such
as
these
are
never
beneath
the
notice
of
a
contemplative
rambler
the
truth
is
in
the
valley
of
the
delaware
the
average
mudhole
is
eminently
respectable
giving
the
matter
a
sober
second
thought
one
will
see
that
mud
is
not
necessarily
offensive
that
of
the
meadows
if
analyzed
proves
to
be
compounded
of
very
worthy
entities
water
clay
sand
and
leafmold
why
because
they
are
associated
should
they
be
so
studiously
shunned
no
chemical
change
has
taken
place
resulting
in
the
formation
of
a
dangerous
mixture
mud
is
unlovable
only
when
you
are
made
its
prisoner
but
even
a
fool
knows
it
is
best
to
remain
outside
the
bars
when
he
comes
to
a
lion
s
cage
the
lily
loves
the
mud
from
which
it
springs
and
who
in
the
wide
world
loves
not
the
lily
let
us
accept
her
as
an
authority
that
this
mud
has
merit
there
is
a
typical
earth
scar
of
the
worthier
sort
within
easy
reach
of
my
dooryard
i
chanced
upon
it
one
february
morning
when
the
surrounding
meadows
were
frostbound
but
the
water
was
free
sparkling
and
full
of
aquatic
life
and
there
is
not
a
month
that
it
has
not
its
growth
of
green
if
not
a
wealth
of
blossoms
even
the
plant
life
of
the
preceding
summer
serves
as
a
covering
in
winter
and
a
january
thaw
starts
the
hardier
grasses
as
surely
as
it
quickens
the
sheltered
upland
dandelions
into
bloom
and
on
this
bleak
february
day
when
the
meadows
were
like
smooth
rock
the
river
a
glacier
and
with
scarce
a
trace
of
green
to
be
seen
on
the
hillside
the
expanding
spathe
of
the
fetid
cabbage
a
plant
full
worthy
of
a
better
name
was
well
above
the
ground
darkly
green
and
beautifully
streaked
with
purple
and
gold
and
a
foot
or
more
below
the
surface
of
the
water
were
even
greener
growths
tangles
of
threadlike
vine
that
quivered
whenever
a
frightened
fish
rushed
by
indeed
these
delicate
growths
are
a
delight
to
our
many
hardy
fishes
that
scorning
to
hibernate
when
food
and
shelter
are
so
accessible
must
laugh
i
think
at
the
darting
icecrystals
that
gather
and
grow
strong
until
they
shut
out
the
sun
but
never
reach
their
weedgrown
habitations
it
was
greener
still
in
march
but
in
april
when
the
meadow
ditches
are
being
decked
with
splatterdock
and
calla
arrowhead
and
sweetflag
goldenclub
and
equisetum
then
from
the
bottom
of
more
than
one
small
pond
spring
up
sharp
spearpointed
rolls
of
rank
green
leaves
growing
until
the
water
s
quiet
surface
is
pierced
and
a
stout
stem
bears
into
view
two
parallel
rolls
of
delicate
leaf
tissue
i
refer
to
the
rare
yellow
lotus
perhaps
not
for
all
time
a
native
but
it
has
long
since
earned
its
right
to
a
place
in
our
flora
most
interesting
is
the
beautiful
adaptation
of
the
leaf
to
its
surroundings
at
the
outset
of
its
growth
tightly
twisted
and
pointed
obliquely
upward
it
meets
with
no
resistance
from
the
water
and
runs
no
risk
of
entanglement
with
other
growths
once
at
the
surface
the
unrolling
is
rapidly
effected
and
a
bronze
chalice
with
an
emerald
lining
is
ready
to
catch
the
dew
as
it
falls
the
circular
perfected
leaf
often
twenty
inches
in
diameter
is
usually
supported
on
a
footstalk
five
or
six
feet
in
height
and
among
them
often
many
floating
leaves
certainly
no
other
of
our
aquatic
plants
has
so
striking
an
appearance
not
even
the
wildrice
at
its
best
that
tangled
trackless
windtossed
waste
above
a
watery
wilderness
gray
gives
as
the
range
of
the
american
species
the
waters
of
the
western
and
southern
states
rare
in
the
middle
states
introduced
into
the
delaware
below
philadelphia
introduced
by
whom
the
indians
are
said
to
have
carried
it
to
the
connecticut
valley
where
it
still
flourishes
in
circumscribed
localities
and
this
i
find
is
the
impression
in
southern
new
jersey
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
little
lake
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
where
also
the
native
lotus
is
found
growing
but
i
have
not
yet
found
a
positive
statement
to
that
effect
rafinesque
in
remarked
as
it
is
scarce
in
the
atlantic
states
it
is
said
to
have
been
planted
in
some
ponds
by
the
indians
the
fact
that
the
southern
and
western
indians
valued
the
plant
is
significant
nuttall
records
that
the
osages
and
other
western
natives
employ
the
roots
of
this
plant
which
is
of
common
occurrence
for
food
preparing
them
by
boiling
when
fully
ripe
after
a
considerable
boiling
they
become
as
farinaceous
agreeable
and
wholesome
as
the
potato
this
same
species
is
everywhere
made
use
of
by
the
natives
who
collect
both
the
nuts
and
the
roots
early
in
the
century
it
was
growing
in
the
meadows
of
the
delaware
below
philadelphia
and
dr
benjamin
smith
barton
considered
it
indigenous
he
says
also
that
efforts
at
cultivating
this
plant
and
multiplying
its
sites
of
growth
have
been
unsuccessfully
made
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
curious
that
kalm
who
gave
so
much
attention
to
the
food
plants
of
our
indians
should
not
mention
the
lotus
it
certainly
could
not
have
been
at
the
time
of
his
visit
here
a
common
plant
yet
the
lower
delaware
where
a
halfcentury
later
it
was
still
found
was
a
locality
about
which
he
botanized
with
much
industry
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
had
he
once
caught
sight
of
its
enormous
leaves
often
thirty
inches
in
diameter
or
seen
the
bright
yellow
blossoms
on
their
towering
stems
he
would
have
omitted
to
make
mention
of
such
an
experience
kalm
spent
a
considerable
part
of
his
time
among
his
countrymen
at
raccoon
now
swedesboro
and
at
woodstown
but
a
few
miles
away
the
native
lotus
grows
luxuriantly
a
relic
it
is
believed
of
indian
waterfarming
there
is
no
improbability
in
the
opinion
that
the
indians
cultivated
the
plant
they
were
certainly
practical
horticulturists
as
well
as
growers
of
field
crops
it
was
of
an
indian
orchard
that
the
pioneer
settler
of
a
new
jersey
town
wrote
when
he
stated
in
that
peaches
were
in
such
plenty
that
some
people
took
their
carts
a
peachgathering
i
could
not
but
smile
at
the
conceit
of
it
they
are
a
very
delicate
fruit
and
hang
almost
like
our
onions
that
are
tied
on
ropes
the
peach
was
probably
introduced
into
florida
by
the
spaniards
and
in
about
a
century
or
less
its
cultivation
by
the
indians
had
reached
northward
as
far
as
new
jersey
the
nuts
and
roots
of
the
lotus
could
as
readily
be
transported
as
the
pits
of
the
peach
so
no
obstacle
was
in
the
way
intertribal
intercourse
was
very
farreaching
as
shown
by
the
occurrence
of
peculiar
forms
of
stone
implements
common
in
distant
localities
and
mexican
obsidian
and
minnesota
red
pipeclay
along
our
eastern
atlantic
seaboard
while
yet
we
have
the
indian
in
mind
it
is
well
to
refer
also
to
the
very
significant
fact
that
these
people
took
the
goldenclub
orontium
aquaticum
from
the
tidewaters
and
planted
it
in
upland
sinkholes
miles
from
the
nearest
spot
where
it
grew
naturally
perhaps
we
can
never
be
positive
about
the
matter
if
a
fiction
it
is
so
pleasing
a
one
i
trust
it
will
never
be
overthrown
to
stand
upon
the
bank
of
a
pond
and
see
in
it
traces
of
both
an
aboriginal
flowergarden
and
a
farm
certainly
adds
to
the
interest
that
surrounds
the
plant
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
emerson
that
thoreau
expected
to
find
the
victoria
regia
about
concord
it
was
but
an
extravagant
method
of
expressing
his
opinion
of
the
merits
of
that
region
but
i
am
not
so
sure
that
the
victoria
is
the
most
beautiful
of
all
aquatic
plants
finding
it
growing
and
blooming
every
summer
in
an
open
field
near
by
i
have
surely
the
right
to
express
my
preference
for
another
it
and
the
lotus
grow
in
the
same
waters
and
i
love
the
lotus
more
give
it
the
first
place
among
flowers
although
there
floats
upon
the
surface
of
these
same
waters
royal
red
lilies
of
india
toothleaved
white
lilies
from
sierra
leone
the
golden
one
of
florida
and
perhaps
more
magnificent
than
all
the
splendid
purple
lily
of
zanzibar
i
can
start
acrosslots
and
quickly
come
upon
them
all
in
an
open
field
but
it
is
the
lotus
that
holds
me
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
the
thought
that
with
the
victoria
as
with
all
its
attendant
lilies
the
hand
of
the
caretaker
is
necessary
a
very
amazon
itself
it
needs
an
amazonian
setting
we
look
for
a
naked
baby
on
the
largest
pad
and
the
infant
s
mother
in
a
canoe
gathering
victorian
seedvessels
these
with
a
troop
of
scarlet
ibises
spurwinged
jacanas
and
chattering
macaws
are
all
needed
to
complete
the
picture
with
them
the
world
has
perhaps
nothing
more
striking
to
offer
without
them
the
plant
is
too
bizarre
too
like
the
eagle
when
shorn
of
its
priceless
gift
of
liberty
not
so
with
the
lotus
it
accords
well
with
the
unpretending
valley
of
the
delaware
is
not
a
thing
apart
but
the
culmination
as
it
were
of
nature
s
vigor
here
and
seemingly
not
out
of
place
even
when
it
fills
a
meadow
mudhole
one
species
is
as
we
have
seen
truly
american
native
and
to
the
manner
born
even
if
introduced
and
cared
for
by
the
indian
along
our
eastern
seaboard
but
now
where
the
wildness
of
the
indians
day
has
been
long
lost
to
us
and
novelty
is
sweet
we
rejoice
to
find
the
lotus
of
the
east
is
no
longer
a
stranger
in
the
land
in
a
now
nameless
little
stream
filling
the
narrow
interval
between
low
hills
till
within
a
few
years
there
grew
little
but
the
yellow
dock
white
arrowleaf
blue
pickerelweed
and
here
and
there
a
lily
it
was
simply
a
typical
muddy
brook
such
as
is
found
everywhere
in
the
drift
areas
of
the
state
every
plant
was
commonplace
but
far
be
it
from
me
to
infer
that
any
one
was
mean
or
meritless
not
a
flower
named
but
is
really
beautiful
yet
save
the
lily
none
would
be
gathered
for
nosegays
why
as
is
so
common
speak
disparagingly
of
the
yellow
nuphar
our
familiar
splatterdock
let
it
be
gathered
with
care
with
no
fleck
of
tideborne
mud
upon
its
petals
and
see
how
rich
the
coloring
and
with
what
grace
the
flower
has
been
molded
i
doubt
not
were
the
nuphar
fragrant
it
would
be
extolled
as
it
deserves
as
were
the
rose
fetid
it
would
be
despised
thus
one
writer
remarks
from
its
filthy
habits
it
has
been
called
with
some
justice
the
froglily
but
wherein
lies
its
filthiness
it
is
hard
to
determine
it
has
no
decided
preference
for
waters
too
stagnant
for
its
fairer
cousin
the
white
nymphæa
and
then
smirched
lilies
are
no
novelties
a
pond
may
be
too
muddy
for
even
them
to
preserve
their
purity
yet
they
will
grow
as
luxuriantly
as
their
unstained
sisters
that
the
nuphar
may
remain
longer
in
the
polluted
waters
than
will
the
nymphæa
does
not
argue
that
it
prefers
such
conditions
and
never
a
frog
but
loved
clean
water
better
than
foul
botanists
should
not
speak
slightingly
of
the
animal
world
it
too
has
its
beauties
and
the
reference
to
the
frog
shows
a
woful
ignorance
of
that
creature
how
many
have
held
the
flowerstalk
of
the
arrowhead
a
seagreen
staff
studded
with
ivory
they
at
least
will
admit
its
beauty
nor
will
the
spike
of
violetblue
flowers
of
the
pickerelweed
fail
to
be
admired
even
if
gathered
and
what
flower
when
torn
from
its
stem
but
loses
grace
no
shrub
so
sprawling
but
fills
its
niche
fittingly
where
these
native
aquatic
plants
grow
they
complete
the
little
landscape
each
would
be
quickly
missed
were
it
absent
they
are
part
and
parcel
of
an
evolved
microcosm
needing
nothing
such
was
this
little
creek
into
the
deep
mud
of
the
stream
widened
here
by
a
dam
to
a
pond
of
several
acres
a
single
tuber
of
the
egyptian
lotus
was
placed
eight
years
ago
and
the
result
awaited
with
much
curiosity
if
not
anxiety
that
same
year
it
sprouted
and
grew
luxuriantly
it
was
soon
too
prominent
a
feature
of
the
landscape
for
its
own
good
the
cows
came
saw
and
tasted
but
did
not
fatally
wound
it
withstood
the
summer
s
heat
but
would
it
withstand
the
winter
s
cold
the
pond
that
before
was
like
all
other
ponds
is
so
no
longer
the
native
growths
that
seemed
so
firmly
rooted
have
disappeared
and
the
lotus
has
taken
all
their
places
so
completely
indeed
that
now
even
the
water
is
shut
from
view
for
more
than
an
acre
s
space
as
the
spot
is
approached
from
the
neighboring
hilltop
we
get
a
bird
seye
view
the
effect
of
which
is
striking
and
thoroughly
unnative
so
far
as
plant
life
is
concerned
and
in
a
measure
disappointing
recall
some
rainy
day
in
a
crowded
city
when
from
an
upper
window
you
have
looked
down
upon
the
street
no
sidewalk
and
but
little
wagonway
to
be
seen
nothing
but
a
waving
expanse
of
upraised
umbrellas
hence
the
disappointment
if
you
have
read
travelers
tales
of
the
lotus
bloom
but
worthier
thoughts
well
up
as
you
draw
nearer
one
has
but
to
glance
over
gray
s
botany
to
notice
how
many
plants
have
been
introduced
from
europe
and
are
now
so
firmly
established
that
native
species
are
forced
to
retire
before
them
the
pond
before
me
exhibits
another
and
so
recent
an
instance
it
has
not
yet
been
recorded
what
radical
changes
this
egyptian
plant
will
work
are
yet
to
be
determined
that
we
can
foresee
one
of
them
the
crowding
out
of
the
nuphar
is
unquestionable
that
any
change
will
be
one
to
be
regretted
is
highly
improbable
to
introduce
the
lotus
is
not
to
repeat
the
blunder
of
the
english
sparrow
it
is
certain
not
to
oust
other
plants
that
are
more
valuable
for
as
yet
we
have
found
little
if
any
value
in
the
products
of
our
marshes
since
the
country
s
settlement
it
has
been
the
aim
of
the
thrifty
to
convert
them
into
dry
land
whenever
practicable
thanks
to
whomsoever
thanks
are
due
many
are
irreclaimable
seeing
how
forcibly
this
wonderful
flower
of
the
lotus
impresses
itself
upon
the
minds
of
the
ancient
egyptians
and
the
east
generally
how
prominently
it
figures
in
eastern
religions
all
idols
of
buddha
are
made
to
rest
upon
opened
lotusflowers
it
is
safe
to
conclude
that
when
familiar
to
all
even
in
this
utilitarian
age
it
will
not
be
merely
ranked
as
one
of
many
flowering
plants
it
is
of
too
commanding
an
appearance
for
this
and
to
literature
will
prove
a
boon
asters
goldenrods
and
buttercups
can
have
a
wellearned
rest
years
ago
the
cultivation
of
the
american
species
proved
a
failure
and
those
who
are
now
best
capable
of
judging
still
record
the
curious
fact
that
the
native
lotus
is
much
more
difficult
to
establish
in
our
waters
than
the
eastern
and
does
not
grow
with
quite
the
same
luxuriance
its
introduction
by
the
aborigines
along
our
eastern
seaboard
has
been
mentioned
perhaps
it
has
lost
vigor
since
it
lost
their
care
and
has
disappeared
excepting
where
its
environment
was
peculiarly
favorable
and
the
question
arises
after
all
is
it
in
the
strict
sense
a
native
may
it
not
indeed
have
been
brought
hither
in
prehistoric
times
the
question
of
a
superlatively
ancient
communication
between
the
continents
is
a
tempting
subject
for
study
and
how
appropriate
when
resting
in
the
shade
of
the
eastern
lotus
such
a
train
of
thought
need
not
stir
up
any
ghost
of
a
mythical
lost
atlantis
still
the
american
form
has
certain
marked
peculiarities
the
mature
torus
has
a
decided
constriction
some
distance
from
the
insertion
of
the
stem
wanting
in
the
foreign
species
and
the
seeds
of
the
former
are
globular
instead
of
distinctly
oval
whatever
the
history
of
the
american
form
that
of
the
eastern
or
egyptian
as
it
is
usually
called
is
too
well
known
to
need
repeating
however
briefly
and
yet
the
plant
is
still
wrapped
in
mystery
a
word
however
concerning
the
term
egyptian
in
connection
with
it
at
present
it
is
a
plant
of
india
of
china
and
japan
australia
the
malay
archipelago
and
the
caspian
sea
an
enormous
range
but
it
is
no
longer
found
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
the
use
of
the
name
rests
upon
the
fact
that
it
was
once
there
not
only
a
cultivated
plant
but
held
sacred
by
the
people
of
that
country
as
it
is
by
the
hindoos
egyptologists
however
are
not
of
one
mind
as
to
the
relation
of
the
lotus
to
the
antiquities
of
the
nile
region
some
questioning
the
matter
altogether
and
considering
the
sculpturing
to
represent
the
lily
of
the
nile
one
of
the
grandest
of
the
white
nymphæas
quite
recently
too
it
has
been
ably
argued
to
be
the
renowned
rose
of
sharon
of
such
a
kingly
flower
solomon
might
well
have
said
i
am
the
rose
of
sharon
perhaps
we
should
be
contented
with
our
splendid
native
flora
but
surely
there
is
room
in
waste
places
our
unappreciated
marshes
and
mudholes
for
the
lotus
a
flower
delicious
as
the
rose
and
stately
as
the
lily
in
her
pride
a
treasure
in
other
lands
why
should
it
not
be
in
ours
if
he
who
causes
two
blades
of
grass
to
grow
where
but
one
grew
before
is
a
public
benefactor
so
he
who
adds
the
lotus
to
our
meadows
must
likewise
be
so
accounted
a
piece
of
color
is
as
useful
as
a
piece
of
bread
with
the
blooming
lotus
within
reach
let
us
come
now
to
a
few
plain
statistics
in
the
little
millpond
it
has
been
exposed
to
precisely
the
same
conditions
as
the
native
plants
and
now
flourishes
in
absolute
perfection
mingled
with
the
fully
expanded
blossoms
may
always
be
seen
the
buds
in
every
stage
of
growth
and
this
from
early
summer
until
frost
happily
there
is
not
as
is
so
often
the
case
a
magnificent
but
brief
display
then
nothing
but
leaves
if
not
a
joy
forever
it
is
at
least
one
of
a
protracted
season
buds
or
blossoms
they
are
alike
beautiful
among
many
that
are
pale
yet
distinctively
tinted
there
often
stands
out
one
or
more
with
the
loosening
petals
tipped
with
deepest
crimson
far
more
are
like
gigantic
tearose
buds
that
soon
open
like
a
tulip
creamy
white
and
rosy
at
the
tips
often
these
glorious
flowers
measure
ten
inches
across
when
fully
open
and
are
supported
by
stems
extending
far
beyond
the
tallest
leaves
one
such
that
i
measured
was
more
than
eight
feet
high
when
the
flower
is
fully
expanded
the
huge
seedpod
or
torus
is
a
prominent
object
herodotus
likened
it
aptly
to
the
nest
of
a
wasp
it
is
of
the
richest
yellow
and
surrounded
by
a
delicate
fringe
of
the
same
color
the
seeds
are
seen
imbedded
in
the
flat
upper
surface
gems
in
a
golden
setting
so
lavish
that
their
own
beauty
is
obscured
after
the
petals
have
fallen
they
are
miniature
boats
of
a
beautiful
pattern
that
catching
the
breeze
sail
with
all
the
grace
of
model
yachts
this
great
seedpod
continues
to
grow
and
is
a
curious
funnelshaped
structure
holding
the
many
seeds
securely
yet
not
concealing
any
the
latter
become
as
large
as
hazelnuts
and
are
quite
as
palatable
and
so
here
in
new
jersey
one
can
be
a
lotuseater
can
float
in
his
canoe
and
pluck
fruit
from
giant
lilies
but
be
not
too
free
to
do
so
it
is
not
the
fabled
lotus
after
all
and
one
s
digestion
may
be
more
disturbed
than
his
mind
pleasantly
affected
in
this
isolated
pond
seen
by
but
few
and
unknown
to
hundreds
living
near
it
a
bit
of
a
far
eastern
landscape
is
reproduced
a
forest
of
graceful
lotus
with
its
strange
leaves
matchless
blossoms
and
wonderful
seedpods
and
what
has
been
here
effected
is
being
repeated
in
the
mudhole
of
my
pasture
meadow
less
than
a
year
ago
when
spring
was
well
advanced
i
placed
a
root
in
the
mud
and
left
it
to
battle
with
the
crowding
native
growths
certainly
the
advantage
was
all
upon
one
side
but
it
did
not
lose
heart
at
being
pitted
against
such
heavy
odds
now
it
overshadows
them
all
for
a
time
they
are
permitted
to
be
cooccupants
but
not
for
long
the
lusty
lotus
is
even
now
reaching
out
to
a
wide
stretch
of
marshy
meadow
and
there
too
i
doubt
not
it
will
flourish
as
at
my
neighbor
s
it
is
a
rightful
ambition
to
be
able
to
sit
down
beneath
one
s
own
vine
and
figtree
let
me
add
the
lotus
for
it
has
come
to
stay
for
how
long
have
waterlilies
been
on
sale
in
our
streets
and
at
our
railway
stations
auguring
well
for
the
love
of
aquatic
plants
and
that
strange
and
scarcely
known
lily
alas
of
almost
mephitic
odor
the
xerophyllum
is
hawked
about
philadelphia
streets
in
early
june
loved
for
its
beauty
despite
the
unfragrance
and
so
too
this
famous
flower
of
other
lands
must
soon
appear
but
not
to
sink
to
the
level
of
a
mere
pretty
blossom
it
is
too
suggestive
a
plant
to
meet
with
such
a
fate
what
margaret
fuller
once
wrote
to
thoreau
well
bears
repeating
seek
the
lotus
and
take
a
draught
of
rapture
an
open
well
it
is
none
of
my
business
but
i
feel
a
twinge
of
indignation
when
as
is
frequently
the
case
i
meet
with
a
pumpmaker
his
long
wagon
with
its
load
of
wooden
tubes
and
other
fixtures
of
the
latest
patterns
of
simple
or
compound
pumps
is
a
positive
eyesore
for
laborsaving
as
this
may
all
be
it
means
nevertheless
the
obliteration
of
the
open
well
and
for
the
old
windlass
or
still
older
sweep
a
hideously
painted
post
of
wood
or
iron
he
who
has
drunk
at
midday
in
july
from
an
old
oaken
bucket
knows
how
great
a
loss
one
suffers
by
the
change
not
even
hawthorne
s
rills
from
the
town
pump
can
quite
reconcile
one
perhaps
it
is
a
fool
s
errand
but
i
have
walked
a
mile
out
of
my
way
scores
of
times
for
no
other
purpose
than
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
bucket
splash
in
the
waters
of
a
deep
well
and
to
draw
it
up
by
means
of
the
wellpoised
sweep
dripping
with
coolness
it
may
be
fancy
but
even
modern
welldiggers
are
a
different
and
prosy
folk
compared
with
the
old
masters
of
the
art
for
art
it
was
they
held
to
locate
with
the
diviningrod
just
where
the
neverfailing
spring
was
bubbling
far
beneath
their
feet
was
a
well
to
be
dug
then
ezek
sureshot
must
do
the
work
and
not
until
years
after
did
it
occur
to
any
one
that
ezek
never
failed
to
learn
the
wishes
of
the
womenfolk
before
he
took
up
the
forked
witchhazel
and
quartered
the
ground
the
result
was
always
the
same
that
mysterious
switch
never
failed
to
point
within
an
inch
of
the
desired
spot
ezek
was
never
known
to
disappoint
his
customers
so
not
one
suspected
his
duplicity
or
lacked
faith
in
the
diviningrod
ay
and
there
are
yet
hosts
of
people
who
still
uphold
its
power
to
locate
not
only
water
but
lost
articles
a
wheat
stubble
was
recently
gone
over
crossed
and
crisscrossed
with
a
diviningrod
to
recover
a
piece
of
metal
as
the
field
was
divided
by
the
man
into
square
yards
it
is
not
strange
the
bit
of
iron
was
found
but
the
credit
was
given
to
the
rod
which
pointed
earthward
at
the
moment
the
man
s
foot
struck
the
missing
object
in
spite
of
what
people
say
there
s
something
very
curious
about
it
was
the
remark
of
one
of
the
head
men
of
the
village
but
this
is
a
digression
happily
there
are
yet
a
few
open
wells
scattered
over
the
country
and
one
of
these
with
its
sweep
is
within
my
range
of
itself
perhaps
not
a
great
deal
can
be
said
but
not
every
hole
in
the
ground
has
such
surroundings
how
seldom
do
we
find
still
standing
and
in
good
repair
houses
that
were
built
early
in
the
preceding
century
looking
west
from
my
study
windows
there
may
be
seen
a
substantial
stone
mansion
built
in
woe
betide
the
tall
man
that
enters
it
carelessly
in
the
dark
the
ceilings
are
unaccountably
low
evidently
there
were
few
giants
in
those
days
at
least
among
the
early
quakers
and
looking
east
can
be
seen
yet
another
house
nearly
as
old
built
of
huge
oak
logs
the
ceilings
of
which
likewise
threaten
the
careless
sixfooter
surely
if
my
ancestors
were
tall
they
must
have
been
painfully
stoopshouldered
by
the
kitchen
doors
of
all
the
original
houses
there
were
open
wells
and
the
sweep
appears
to
have
been
the
first
apparatus
in
use
for
drawing
water
from
the
doorstep
to
the
wellcurb
extended
a
rude
pavement
of
flat
stones
and
if
all
poetry
was
not
smothered
in
the
oldtime
peoples
breasts
there
was
an
elm
or
drooping
birch
casting
a
delightful
shade
in
summer
over
all
later
the
weepingwillow
became
the
favorite
tree
such
was
the
pretty
picture
seen
upon
every
farm
compare
it
with
the
ugly
windmills
that
now
rear
their
hideous
nakedness
against
the
sky
from
the
general
to
the
particular
from
the
past
to
the
present
there
still
stands
a
cottage
off
a
byroad
mossy
as
a
prostrate
oaken
tree
hedged
with
gooseberrybushes
and
a
clump
of
lilacs
and
better
than
all
else
there
is
the
well
and
its
sweep
i
could
never
learn
when
the
cottage
was
built
but
it
was
many
a
year
ago
and
its
present
occupants
may
have
commenced
housekeeping
as
far
back
in
time
to
judge
from
appearances
may
they
and
the
cottage
last
forever
nowhere
else
can
so
much
woodlore
and
wise
weathersaws
be
had
at
first
hands
nowhere
else
is
there
at
least
for
me
the
mosscovered
bucket
that
hangs
in
the
well
there
are
many
features
of
primitive
country
life
that
are
fascinating
yet
why
they
are
so
can
not
readily
be
explained
to
linger
by
this
open
well
is
one
of
these
yet
why
even
hours
can
be
spent
at
such
a
spot
one
can
not
tell
has
it
to
do
with
a
love
of
retrospection
common
to
all
past
fifty
let
this
go
for
an
explanation
whether
one
or
not
stay
can
it
be
that
after
quaffing
a
gourdful
of
the
sweet
waters
i
recall
many
an
invitation
to
the
cottage
and
hope
even
yet
i
am
as
ready
to
respond
when
the
old
lady
s
kindly
face
beams
from
the
open
door
for
straightway
there
are
visions
of
cakes
and
beer
the
liking
for
which
has
never
been
even
dulled
gingercakes
merely
but
such
gingercakes
spicewood
beer
only
but
what
sparkle
what
tingling
spiciness
the
very
essence
of
the
wild
woods
about
the
cottage
the
brilliant
glistening
of
the
old
well
s
brightest
drops
here
are
combined
in
a
beady
golden
draught
that
quickly
inebriates
makes
drunken
with
a
love
of
oldtime
cottage
days
the
old
lady
s
gossip
of
the
days
gone
by
adds
to
the
very
sparkle
of
her
beer
yet
her
whole
life
for
more
than
half
a
century
seems
centered
upon
her
one
adventure
the
coming
and
going
of
her
children
passing
as
too
prosaic
to
mention
not
so
that
one
great
fright
and
its
results
the
now
almost
forgotten
camden
and
amboy
railroad
was
then
in
operation
but
though
scarcely
more
than
a
mile
distant
it
was
as
nothing
to
her
she
knew
neither
what
nor
where
it
was
but
where
the
best
whortleberries
grew
in
the
back
swamp
that
was
knowledge
worth
possessing
although
her
cousin
abijah
had
killed
a
bear
during
the
winter
she
did
not
think
of
it
then
and
started
for
berries
where
few
men
would
care
to
follow
she
knew
every
crooked
path
in
the
sproutlands
and
could
find
her
way
through
them
in
the
dark
she
boasted
and
so
with
a
light
heart
she
gathered
berries
but
at
last
an
ominous
screeching
fell
upon
her
ears
she
stopped
her
work
to
listen
louder
and
more
angry
ay
and
nearer
too
was
that
portentous
scream
could
it
be
another
bear
she
thought
and
at
once
turned
her
face
homeward
the
big
basket
was
not
quite
full
and
there
were
such
loads
of
fruit
within
easy
reach
it
was
tantalizing
but
all
doubt
vanished
with
the
second
shriller
more
unearthly
scream
the
path
was
no
longer
plain
nor
she
surefooted
pitching
recklessly
forward
the
berries
were
bounced
by
handfuls
from
the
basket
and
it
finally
as
a
dragging
weight
was
thrown
aside
and
still
sounding
through
the
swamp
the
terrible
screeching
of
that
angry
bear
the
cottage
at
last
was
seen
through
the
thickset
trees
but
not
so
plainly
the
tortuous
path
the
frightened
woman
was
moved
by
but
one
thought
to
reach
her
home
and
escaping
until
now
all
other
dangers
she
took
one
misstep
almost
at
her
journey
s
end
and
sank
waistdeep
in
yielding
mud
there
was
strength
left
for
but
one
despairing
cry
which
fortunately
fell
not
upon
deaf
ears
in
a
moment
her
husband
came
to
her
rescue
such
was
her
story
but
by
no
means
as
she
told
it
a
quaint
narrative
that
invariably
concluded
with
the
pathetic
remark
and
to
think
i
lost
all
them
beautiful
berries
the
old
lady
had
heard
the
first
screech
of
a
locomotive
that
awoke
the
echoes
in
the
nottingham
swamps
all
the
while
her
patient
husband
sits
by
the
fire
giving
vent
to
his
feelings
by
a
vicious
poke
at
the
smouldering
backlog
for
fifty
years
he
has
been
her
audience
and
the
story
is
now
a
trifle
monotonous
so
much
so
that
no
sooner
has
she
finished
at
least
when
i
was
present
than
he
remarks
if
you
tell
the
lad
that
story
any
more
i
ll
awished
you
d
stayed
stuck
in
the
swamp
and
then
we
have
another
cup
of
beer
and
followed
by
the
old
man
i
start
for
home
and
isn
t
it
funny
the
old
man
tells
me
as
he
has
never
failed
to
do
for
many
a
year
as
i
pause
by
the
open
well
where
we
part
how
he
found
gold
as
he
thought
when
he
dug
the
well
and
kept
the
mighty
secret
until
his
plans
were
laid
and
it
proved
to
be
nothing
but
lumps
of
iron
and
brimstone
if
old
ladies
prove
at
times
to
be
a
bit
garrulous
what
of
the
old
men
who
are
so
prone
to
criticise
part
iii
in
summer
a
noisome
weed
the
whispering
breeze
that
at
sunrise
calls
me
out
of
doors
is
laden
now
with
the
matchless
odor
of
the
blooming
grape
every
draught
of
the
vinous
air
intoxicates
and
the
eye
rests
upon
the
brilliant
landscape
but
is
scarce
content
a
curious
feeling
of
indecision
meets
me
at
the
very
outset
meadow
and
upland
are
alike
urgent
field
and
forest
offer
their
choicest
gifts
rugged
rocks
and
sparkling
river
both
beckon
to
me
whither
then
of
a
bright
june
morning
should
the
rambler
stroll
for
is
it
not
true
that
beauty
when
in
bewildering
confusion
ceases
to
be
beautiful
when
a
thousand
birds
as
a
great
cloud
shut
out
the
sun
they
are
but
a
cloud
but
a
single
one
perched
upon
a
tree
is
a
marvel
of
grace
and
beauty
so
the
sloping
hillside
and
the
weedy
meadows
brilliant
with
every
shade
of
freshest
green
and
starred
with
a
hundred
tints
roseate
golden
and
white
call
for
an
infinite
power
of
contemplation
and
leave
the
wanderer
dazed
shutting
my
eyes
to
the
wealth
of
bloom
about
me
closing
my
ears
to
the
melody
of
every
nesting
bird
i
start
upon
the
doubtful
quest
of
the
commonplace
hoping
to
chance
upon
some
neglected
spot
that
happily
generous
june
has
overlooked
as
has
happened
so
frequently
before
where
i
least
expected
it
there
stood
the
object
of
my
search
a
gem
in
a
setting
not
so
elaborate
that
its
beauties
were
obscured
in
a
longneglected
pasture
a
wide
meadow
torn
by
freshets
foul
with
noisome
weeds
and
strown
with
the
wreckage
left
by
winter
s
storms
grew
many
a
graceful
vine
that
few
have
heeded
for
it
is
not
enough
that
the
botanist
should
long
ago
have
named
it
and
that
others
should
have
besmirched
its
proper
fame
by
calling
it
carrionflower
can
we
not
forgive
the
offense
to
the
nostril
when
the
eye
is
captivated
does
it
go
for
nothing
that
a
plant
beautifies
the
waste
places
and
invites
you
to
contemplate
it
as
the
acme
of
grace
because
in
selfdefense
it
warns
you
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
sitting
in
the
pleasant
shade
of
clustering
thorns
i
see
nothing
now
that
attracts
me
more
than
the
leafy
bowers
of
this
curious
vine
every
one
has
sprung
boldly
from
the
sod
in
full
faith
of
finding
the
support
it
needs
at
least
i
see
none
that
are
standing
quite
alone
two
it
may
be
but
oftener
three
or
four
have
started
at
convenient
distances
and
when
well
above
the
tallest
grass
each
has
sought
out
the
tendrils
of
its
nearest
neighbor
and
these
have
closely
intertwined
so
here
and
there
we
have
a
leafy
arch
and
scattered
among
them
many
a
pretty
bower
these
may
well
have
given
the
indian
a
clew
to
wigwambuilding
had
ever
in
the
distant
past
a
savage
seen
his
child
creep
beneath
the
overarching
branches
of
the
despised
carrionflower
he
would
have
seen
how
easily
a
summer
shelter
might
be
made
perhaps
upon
some
such
hint
the
stuffy
caves
and
rockshelters
were
abandoned
for
the
time
surely
was
when
even
a
more
primitive
dwelling
than
a
tent
was
man
s
protection
against
the
summer
s
sun
and
may
not
these
mutually
supporting
vines
have
struck
the
fancy
of
some
indian
poet
in
the
wigwams
of
these
people
who
but
two
centuries
ago
peopled
these
meadows
and
the
surrounding
hills
may
not
many
a
pretty
tale
have
been
told
of
these
same
despised
carrionflowers
dyer
states
in
his
charming
folklore
of
plants
how
in
the
servian
folksong
there
grows
out
of
the
youth
s
body
a
green
fir
out
of
the
maiden
s
a
red
rose
which
entwine
together
i
should
not
wonder
at
learning
that
so
too
the
indian
believed
that
from
the
bodies
of
braves
who
had
fallen
together
fighting
for
the
same
cause
had
sprung
these
intertwining
vines
that
cling
now
so
firmly
to
each
other
why
indeed
should
not
the
tragedy
of
tristram
and
ysonde
have
been
reenacted
on
the
delaware
meadows
but
though
despised
by
man
this
vigorous
plant
has
hosts
of
other
friends
the
summer
long
scores
of
bugs
butterflies
and
beetles
crowd
about
whether
when
in
leaf
only
or
later
when
in
bloom
or
in
autumn
when
laden
with
its
wealth
of
blueblack
berries
it
is
never
quite
alone
and
many
of
its
attendants
are
fully
as
curious
as
the
plant
itself
one
or
more
minute
beetles
prefer
it
to
all
other
plants
yet
not
because
of
the
peculiar
odor
at
least
the
same
creatures
do
not
crowd
decaying
flesh
on
the
other
hand
the
dainty
flies
that
linger
about
the
ruddy
phlox
the
blue
iris
and
purple
pentstemon
tarry
likewise
about
the
carrionflower
and
find
it
a
pleasant
place
if
one
may
judge
by
the
length
of
time
they
stay
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
find
this
to
be
the
case
as
i
looked
for
a
repetition
on
a
small
scale
of
what
is
recorded
of
those
strange
plants
the
rafflesiaceæ
found
in
the
tropics
forbes
in
his
wanderings
in
the
eastern
archipelago
records
that
once
he
nearly
trampled
on
a
fine
new
species
of
that
curious
family
it
smelt
powerfully
of
putrid
flesh
and
was
infested
with
a
crowd
of
flies
which
followed
me
all
the
way
as
i
carried
it
home
and
was
besides
overrun
with
ants
so
far
my
own
observation
what
say
others
let
us
turn
however
to
a
more
savory
subject
undeterred
by
possible
whiffs
of
sickening
scent
i
followed
the
example
of
my
friend
the
meadowmouse
and
crept
into
the
largest
smilax
wigwam
i
could
find
it
was
sufficiently
roomy
for
all
my
needs
and
shed
the
sun
s
rays
better
than
it
would
have
done
the
drops
of
a
summer
shower
the
east
wind
brought
the
rank
odor
of
the
marshes
and
more
fitfully
the
tinkling
notes
of
the
marshwrens
that
now
crowd
the
rank
growths
of
typha
but
sweeter
songs
soon
rang
out
near
by
as
the
nervous
maryland
yellowthroat
thinking
me
gone
perched
within
arm
s
length
and
sang
with
all
its
energy
the
power
of
that
wee
creature
s
voice
was
absolutely
startling
we
seldom
realize
how
far
off
many
a
bird
may
be
when
we
hear
it
sing
often
looking
immediately
about
us
when
a
strange
note
falls
upon
our
ears
certainly
this
yellowthroat
s
utterance
might
have
been
distinctly
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
such
shrill
whistling
is
no
child
s
play
either
every
feather
of
the
bird
was
rumpled
the
tail
slightly
spread
the
wings
partly
uplifted
and
the
body
swayed
up
and
down
as
the
notes
seven
of
them
were
screeched
i
can
think
of
no
more
expressive
word
it
was
not
musical
and
yet
this
bird
has
long
been
ranked
to
my
mind
as
one
of
our
most
pleasing
songsters
it
needs
a
few
rods
distance
however
to
smooth
away
the
rough
edges
but
the
great
point
gained
in
the
day
s
outing
was
to
find
that
even
the
carrionflower
could
be
put
to
such
good
use
it
makes
a
capital
observatory
wherein
and
wherefrom
to
study
the
life
of
the
open
meadows
to
these
naturebuilt
shelters
you
are
always
welcome
the
latchstring
is
always
hanging
out
and
if
perchance
you
do
not
share
its
single
room
with
many
a
creature
that
loves
the
shade
at
noontide
and
so
while
away
many
an
hour
in
choicest
company
you
may
lie
at
its
open
door
and
watch
the
strange
procession
that
forever
passes
by
it
may
be
a
mink
a
mouse
or
a
muskrat
may
hurry
by
bound
on
some
errand
that
piques
your
curiosity
a
lazy
turtle
may
waddle
to
your
den
and
gaze
in
blank
astonishment
at
you
and
better
than
all
else
the
pretty
garter
snakes
will
come
and
go
salute
you
with
a
graceful
darting
of
their
forked
tongues
and
then
pass
on
perhaps
to
tell
their
neighbor
what
strange
sights
they
have
seen
and
as
the
day
draws
to
a
close
what
myriad
songs
rise
from
every
blade
of
grass
hosts
of
unseen
musicians
pipe
to
the
passing
breeze
and
crickets
everywhere
chirp
so
shrilly
that
the
house
about
me
trembles
the
day
is
done
but
the
night
brings
no
end
of
novelty
the
moping
herons
are
no
longer
stupid
the
blinking
owls
are
all
activity
afar
off
the
whippoorwill
calls
who
knows
why
and
the
marshowl
protests
as
well
it
may
at
such
unseemly
clatter
how
quickly
into
a
new
world
has
the
familiar
meadow
grown
through
the
halfnaked
beam
and
rafters
of
my
leafy
tent
i
watch
the
nightprowling
birds
go
hurrying
by
and
follow
their
shadows
as
the
weird
bats
flit
before
me
for
the
moon
has
risen
and
in
its
pallid
light
every
familiar
tree
and
shrub
and
all
the
nightloving
wildlife
of
the
meadows
is
wrapped
in
uncanny
garbs
it
is
fitting
now
that
a
filmy
mist
should
rise
as
a
curtain
and
shut
out
the
view
he
is
none
of
us
seems
to
shout
every
creature
in
my
ear
and
taking
the
hint
i
pick
my
way
homeward
through
the
dripping
grass
a
wayside
brook
it
is
not
that
i
may
indulge
in
mock
heroics
that
i
champion
the
socalled
wasteplaces
but
out
of
pure
love
for
the
merits
of
even
the
least
of
nature
s
work
a
single
cedar
casts
sufficient
shade
for
me
and
resting
full
length
on
a
bed
of
yarrow
i
have
at
once
the
breath
of
the
tropics
and
the
aroma
of
the
spice
islands
wherewith
to
while
away
these
july
days
from
such
a
spot
there
is
pleasure
too
in
watching
the
shifting
scenes
of
the
sunlit
world
beyond
a
pleasure
greater
than
peering
into
the
depths
of
a
dark
monotonous
swamp
or
pathless
wood
but
if
this
is
simplifying
matters
beyond
reasonable
limits
then
let
us
to
a
wayside
brook
and
to
the
shade
and
spiciness
add
the
music
of
rippling
waters
surely
this
should
suffice
the
idle
saunterer
at
midsummer
when
it
is
ninety
in
the
shade
it
is
wiser
to
watch
the
minnows
in
a
brook
than
to
battle
with
pickerel
in
the
millpond
nor
should
such
contemplation
be
too
trivial
for
one
s
fancy
even
little
fishes
have
their
ups
and
downs
although
everything
goes
swimmingly
with
them
as
has
been
said
somewhere
if
my
memory
plays
me
no
tricks
the
fishworld
is
diversified
by
other
occurrences
than
feeding
or
going
to
feed
others
in
other
words
they
have
impressions
vague
though
they
may
be
of
the
world
about
them
and
existence
is
something
more
than
a
cold
sweet
silver
life
wrapped
in
round
waves
quickened
with
touches
of
transporting
fear
the
brook
need
not
be
deep
nor
wide
and
may
wander
through
many
a
rod
of
dusty
fields
scarcely
covering
the
pebbles
that
bestrew
its
bed
and
yet
contain
fishes
i
have
often
been
surprised
to
find
many
small
minnows
in
brooks
that
were
scarcely
more
than
damp
except
here
and
there
a
springhole
or
pool
about
the
roots
of
a
tree
such
places
are
noble
huntinggrounds
if
the
rambler
is
an
enthusiastic
naturalist
and
many
a
chapter
might
be
written
concerning
our
smallest
fishes
except
to
very
few
they
are
wholly
unknown
on
the
bank
of
a
little
wayside
brook
i
tarried
for
half
a
day
recently
with
minnows
birds
and
dragonflies
to
keep
me
company
and
what
a
royal
time
we
had
at
first
the
fish
were
shy
and
took
refuge
under
flat
pebbles
but
i
coaxed
them
forth
at
last
by
tossing
crumbs
before
them
at
ease
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
they
commenced
their
beautiful
game
of
chasing
sunbeams
the
largest
stone
in
the
stream
being
the
base
from
which
they
ceaselessly
darted
to
and
fro
the
flashing
of
the
fishes
silvery
sides
the
darting
rays
of
sunlight
the
sparkle
of
the
great
bubbles
that
danced
on
every
ripple
proved
a
very
carnival
of
light
and
color
the
soul
of
which
was
this
company
of
funloving
minnows
in
saying
this
i
intend
to
convey
all
the
meaning
that
such
a
phrase
comprehends
in
other
words
to
ascribe
to
these
small
fishes
a
pronounced
degree
of
intelligence
their
life
proved
not
without
its
shadows
however
as
very
often
their
merriment
was
changed
to
terror
in
a
twinkling
it
happened
that
a
gorgeous
dragonfly
came
with
a
sudden
onset
to
the
little
brook
and
filled
these
fish
with
fear
while
it
hovered
above
them
i
leave
it
to
others
to
say
why
the
minnows
should
have
been
afraid
has
any
person
ever
seen
a
dragonfly
catch
a
fish
prof
seeley
writing
of
a
european
cyprinoid
remarks
probably
every
person
who
has
ever
looked
into
a
small
stream
has
been
surprised
by
the
singular
way
in
which
minnows
constantly
arrange
themselves
in
circles
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
with
their
heads
nearly
meeting
in
the
center
and
tails
diverging
at
equal
distances
i
looked
for
this
but
our
jersey
minnows
were
not
so
methodically
inclined
and
all
kept
their
heads
in
one
direction
upstream
until
at
a
certain
point
when
as
if
on
signal
given
they
would
right
about
face
and
dart
downstream
for
a
yard
or
two
reform
and
as
a
company
make
their
way
to
the
dispersing
point
a
thin
slab
of
stone
that
barred
their
further
passage
so
in
this
most
unpromising
spot
i
found
no
end
of
entertainment
and
except
in
midsummer
would
not
have
tired
of
any
single
feature
but
study
even
studies
afield
are
irksome
in
july
and
i
forgot
the
minnows
as
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
large
slab
of
stone
near
where
i
was
lying
it
was
one
of
four
broad
steppingstones
that
nearly
two
centuries
ago
were
placed
here
then
there
flowed
through
a
thick
woods
a
broad
stream
and
near
here
the
first
house
was
built
upon
these
stones
had
stepped
the
grave
elders
and
loitered
the
lighthearted
children
of
three
generations
and
now
not
a
trace
of
house
garden
barn
woods
or
pasture
remains
everything
has
given
way
to
more
pretentious
structures
broader
fields
and
painfully
angular
highways
the
onetime
winding
lane
shaded
by
noble
oaks
is
now
not
even
to
be
traced
across
the
fields
and
instead
thereof
a
narrow
sunny
strip
of
yellow
sand
leads
to
the
public
road
what
an
improvement
once
remarked
a
neighbor
when
the
change
was
made
what
an
improvement
indeed
where
once
was
beauty
one
finds
save
this
little
remnant
of
a
creek
an
endless
array
of
fields
with
scarcely
a
tree
along
the
division
fences
doubtless
could
the
brook
have
been
obliterated
the
work
would
have
been
undertaken
as
it
is
the
narrow
strip
is
all
that
nature
can
call
her
own
and
so
whatever
of
her
charms
can
find
a
place
here
she
sets
them
down
and
so
here
a
rambler
may
be
happy
or
fairly
content
at
least
if
he
does
not
raise
his
eyes
continually
to
scan
the
horizon
i
for
one
on
the
halfloaf
principle
accept
the
wayside
brooks
with
thankfulness
and
now
after
long
years
have
found
that
in
many
an
essential
feature
they
do
not
suffer
so
greatly
as
one
might
suppose
when
compared
with
nature
s
more
pretentious
waterways
let
nature
on
however
small
a
scale
have
the
upper
hand
and
at
such
a
spot
the
rambler
can
afford
to
tarry
but
perhaps
i
am
partial
for
this
was
my
playground
forty
years
ago
still
i
would
say
let
not
the
wayside
dells
go
unregarded
why
ever
longing
for
the
hills
or
sea
who
loves
earth
s
modest
gifts
is
well
rewarded
and
hears
the
woodthrush
sing
as
cheerily
as
when
by
mountain
brooks
it
trills
its
lay
to
soothe
the
dying
moments
of
the
day
here
where
no
busy
toilers
ever
rest
where
but
the
wayside
weeds
reach
from
the
sod
i
love
to
be
the
merry
cricket
s
guest
and
find
though
all
is
mean
no
soulless
clod
the
bubbling
spring
the
mossy
pebbles
near
the
stunted
beech
they
all
are
justly
dear
likeminded
birds
so
i
am
not
alone
linger
as
lovingly
around
the
spot
whose
subtle
charm
such
mighty
spell
has
thrown
that
wander
where
i
will
tis
ne
er
forgot
here
child
and
bird
learned
first
to
love
the
sky
the
tree
the
spring
the
grass
whereon
i
lie
when
timid
spring
warms
with
her
smile
the
way
with
allimpatient
steps
i
hasten
here
no
bloom
so
bright
in
all
the
bowers
of
may
as
the
pale
violets
that
cluster
near
bright
grow
the
skies
nor
troubling
shadows
fall
childhood
returns
when
joy
encompassed
all
wayside
trees
who
that
has
ever
walked
in
the
country
has
not
blessed
the
farmer
who
planted
or
early
settler
who
spared
the
wayside
trees
the
average
country
road
especially
in
the
poorer
farming
districts
is
something
deplorable
only
too
often
even
when
shady
and
otherwise
attractive
there
lies
only
the
choice
of
wallowing
through
sand
stumbling
over
rocks
or
tripping
over
briers
that
would
shame
the
gordian
knot
for
close
entanglement
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
wellworn
paths
far
from
the
town
s
limits
unless
nature
has
provided
them
but
something
a
little
better
than
the
remote
highways
as
they
now
are
might
certainly
be
had
is
there
not
sufficient
tax
collected
in
every
township
to
secure
this
probably
the
farmer
who
never
walks
to
the
village
and
finds
the
wagonway
fairly
passable
may
insist
that
the
pedestrian
can
pick
his
way
however
rough
the
ground
true
but
this
does
not
dissipate
the
pedestrian
s
just
claims
a
man
that
must
walk
because
too
poor
to
ride
is
none
the
less
worthy
of
consideration
and
may
well
grumble
if
his
right
of
way
is
blocked
of
course
man
must
take
the
world
as
he
finds
it
and
alter
it
if
he
can
and
such
an
alteration
is
practicable
where
good
roads
or
footpaths
can
not
be
in
the
planting
and
preservation
of
wayside
trees
such
was
the
current
of
my
thoughts
when
i
met
recently
the
overseer
of
a
highway
resting
at
noon
from
his
labors
to
him
and
for
him
a
little
speech
was
made
and
what
was
the
reply
too
many
shadetrees
will
encourage
the
tramps
so
he
who
loves
to
wander
out
of
town
must
take
the
dusty
highways
as
they
are
and
sigh
for
pleasant
shade
he
can
not
enter
to
plant
a
wayside
tree
to
have
a
country
byway
beautiful
must
not
be
thought
of
it
will
encourage
the
tramps
now
it
so
happens
that
near
where
i
live
a
chestnuttree
was
spared
two
centuries
ago
probably
because
it
was
too
crooked
for
fencerails
certainly
for
no
praiseworthy
motive
was
it
allowed
to
stand
but
it
does
and
so
today
it
casts
a
shadow
in
which
half
a
regiment
might
gather
not
strangely
at
all
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
neighborhood
loves
the
old
tree
and
points
to
it
with
pride
were
it
struck
by
lightning
it
would
have
a
public
funeral
and
yet
i
have
not
found
that
any
of
my
neighbors
except
those
very
near
the
town
have
planted
even
a
single
wayside
tree
on
the
contrary
a
noble
row
of
catalpas
was
felled
not
long
since
for
fenceposts
a
wayside
tree
means
to
the
pedestrian
something
more
than
a
mere
island
of
shade
in
an
ocean
of
sunshine
a
stately
tree
has
many
lovers
and
hosts
of
birds
are
sure
to
crowd
its
branches
such
a
tree
then
becomes
the
mecca
whereat
the
rambler
spends
the
hours
of
hot
high
noon
not
only
pleasurably
but
profitably
for
i
hold
that
a
bird
can
not
be
watched
for
long
without
gain
is
it
nothing
as
one
rests
in
the
shade
after
a
long
tramp
to
have
a
woodthrush
sing
to
him
is
it
not
a
lesson
to
the
weakhearted
to
hear
the
restless
redeye
s
ceaseless
song
the
perverse
grumbler
has
he
a
trace
of
reason
will
at
least
secretly
own
that
much
of
which
he
complains
might
be
far
worse
after
listening
to
the
singing
of
a
bird
perched
in
a
wayside
tree
though
shorn
of
so
much
that
nature
granted
to
the
most
commonplace
of
lands
chaos
has
not
quite
come
again
certainly
however
barren
a
sandy
field
may
look
it
is
not
yet
a
desert
as
any
ornithologist
will
tell
you
birds
though
there
be
little
that
favors
them
and
much
that
is
harmful
beset
them
everywhere
will
persistently
cling
to
a
tree
by
the
roadside
will
even
nest
in
it
although
the
ubiquitous
small
boy
showers
them
with
stones
and
more
though
persecution
is
the
order
of
their
day
will
sing
as
in
a
paradise
regained
thankful
that
the
world
has
even
this
much
of
untamed
nature
left
if
then
in
spite
of
themselves
farmers
love
what
wayside
trees
there
are
why
can
we
not
have
more
think
of
a
leisured
stroll
of
a
hot
summer
s
day
through
a
long
avenue
of
leafy
oaks
skeletonlifting
there
are
probably
very
few
people
but
have
seen
the
pretty
stone
arrowheads
that
are
found
often
in
abundance
after
the
fields
have
been
plowed
i
have
often
filled
my
pockets
with
them
while
wandering
about
and
in
the
words
of
a
friend
been
amazed
at
the
numbers
which
are
sown
over
the
face
of
our
country
betokening
a
most
prolonged
possession
of
the
soil
by
their
makers
for
a
hunting
population
is
always
sparse
and
the
collector
finds
only
those
arrowheads
which
lie
upon
the
surface
but
if
their
handiwork
is
abundant
not
so
their
skeletons
and
it
is
the
uncanny
taste
of
archæologists
to
prize
the
bones
as
well
as
the
weapons
of
the
indians
still
it
is
not
more
objectionable
to
carefully
preserve
the
bones
in
a
glass
case
than
to
scatter
them
with
the
plowshare
because
it
is
well
to
turn
aside
from
beaten
tracks
occasionally
that
we
may
appreciate
their
beauty
the
more
upon
our
return
and
avoid
the
danger
of
having
the
sweets
of
the
upland
or
the
meadow
pall
i
have
been
indulging
of
late
in
archæological
pursuits
been
gathering
relics
though
the
locust
and
wild
cherry
drooped
with
their
burden
of
bright
bloom
and
the
grosbeaks
wooed
me
to
the
hillside
notwithstanding
this
i
resolutely
turned
my
back
upon
bird
and
blossom
alike
and
sought
a
neighbor
s
field
over
which
waved
tall
and
stately
grain
it
was
proposed
to
give
the
day
but
as
it
proved
the
night
was
added
to
archæology
there
were
weighty
reasons
of
course
for
this
intrusion
upon
my
neighbor
s
land
as
no
sane
man
without
a
potent
incentive
would
dare
to
walk
through
growing
grain
what
moved
me
to
so
bold
a
deed
was
this
last
autumn
i
discovered
that
my
farmer
neighbor
had
two
skeletons
and
of
one
of
which
he
neither
had
any
use
nor
knowledge
of
its
existence
when
apprised
of
the
fact
he
expressed
no
surprise
but
resolutely
declined
my
offer
to
become
the
custodian
of
the
superfluous
bones
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
make
appropriation
next
to
impossible
but
i
bided
my
time
and
now
these
bright
june
days
the
grain
kindly
covers
the
ground
and
every
creeping
thing
upon
it
as
it
proved
when
a
dog
bounded
into
the
field
on
the
trail
of
a
rabbit
i
forthwith
took
the
hint
and
crept
upon
the
trail
of
a
dead
indian
the
danger
of
discovery
real
not
fancied
gave
something
of
zest
to
the
work
with
only
a
garden
trowel
the
earth
over
a
marked
spot
was
carefully
removed
and
as
i
had
all
the
while
to
lie
upon
my
breast
while
at
work
the
task
was
a
painfully
slow
one
and
i
more
than
once
wished
myself
away
until
a
few
small
bones
were
brought
to
light
then
all
thought
of
discomfort
vanished
bone
after
bone
was
slowly
uncovered
but
all
alas
were
so
friable
that
not
one
could
be
removed
with
safety
in
a
short
time
the
entire
skeleton
was
laid
bare
but
under
what
strange
circumstances
i
had
it
within
my
grasp
but
could
not
move
it
nor
indeed
myself
more
than
to
crouch
in
the
tall
grain
about
me
it
was
too
like
digging
one
s
own
grave
and
once
imagining
an
approach
i
lay
full
length
by
the
side
of
my
fleshless
friend
the
day
of
my
rejoicing
had
come
it
is
true
but
there
proved
to
be
an
overabundance
of
thorns
with
the
rose
here
was
the
longcoveted
skeleton
but
within
hearing
in
the
adjoining
field
was
a
burly
farmer
passing
to
and
fro
with
his
plow
whenever
he
came
near
the
grinning
skull
grew
pale
as
though
it
too
feared
discovery
and
so
until
the
dinnerhorn
sounded
acrosslots
i
was
held
a
prisoner
how
anxiously
did
i
listen
for
retreating
steps
and
the
rattling
of
the
unloosened
plowchains
welcome
sounds
that
came
at
last
assuring
me
that
the
coast
was
clear
then
leaving
the
treasure
to
the
kindly
sun
that
was
rapidly
warming
it
to
hardness
i
sped
dinnerward
the
fates
were
intolerably
cruel
that
day
at
sunset
when
i
purposed
to
return
innumerable
obstacles
loomed
up
and
every
excuse
to
run
away
from
company
that
had
most
inopportunely
arrived
was
poohpoohed
by
madam
in
a
most
meaning
manner
and
it
was
just
midnight
when
the
open
grave
was
reached
the
full
moon
at
that
moment
broke
through
the
clouds
and
a
flood
of
pallid
light
filled
the
spot
when
i
shook
hands
with
the
fleshless
warrior
and
forced
myself
to
return
the
ghastly
grin
of
his
angular
countenance
there
was
something
of
defiance
too
in
his
eyeless
sockets
and
a
ghost
of
resistance
as
he
was
lifted
from
a
couch
that
he
had
occupied
for
some
three
thousand
moons
at
least
the
rattle
of
his
disjointedness
was
as
harsh
as
the
language
that
once
he
spake
and
while
i
thridded
the
woods
and
skirted
on
my
way
home
the
resounding
marshes
where
every
frog
most
ominously
croaked
every
jostle
of
the
warrior
s
bones
seemed
to
force
a
protesting
syllable
between
his
rattling
teeth
with
all
deference
to
the
votaries
of
archæology
skeletonlifting
by
moonlight
is
i
claim
a
most
uncanny
pastime
why
i
prefer
a
country
life
uz
gaunt
was
in
the
writer
s
experience
the
most
levelheaded
of
farmers
he
once
remarked
town
folks
smile
at
my
vim
and
way
of
putting
things
but
i
d
rather
be
next
neighbor
to
natur
than
to
most
of
the
town
folks
that
remark
impressed
me
many
a
year
ago
as
a
nugget
of
pure
wisdom
and
now
when
on
the
shady
side
of
forty
i
still
think
it
wiser
than
any
casual
remark
learned
essay
or
eloquent
oration
i
have
ever
heard
in
town
it
is
a
sad
error
to
suppose
that
a
rustic
is
akin
to
a
fool
and
a
citizen
s
real
worth
may
be
measured
by
his
manner
of
speaking
of
the
country
people
that
a
significant
difference
obtains
can
scarcely
be
denied
but
it
is
not
one
that
altogether
exalts
the
dweller
in
town
and
degrades
the
farmer
will
any
one
pretend
to
say
that
the
latter
is
less
intelligent
or
refined
the
simple
fact
is
the
two
classes
are
differently
educated
the
townsman
largely
by
books
the
farmer
to
a
great
extent
by
his
surroundings
the
former
comes
by
his
facts
through
hearsay
the
latter
by
observation
in
other
words
the
citizen
tends
to
artificiality
the
farmer
to
naturalness
the
one
is
educated
the
other
acquires
knowledge
dead
weigh
their
brains
and
which
may
claim
the
greater
number
of
ounces
and
here
let
me
say
in
passing
that
not
all
knowledge
worth
possessing
has
yet
got
into
books
is
it
not
true
that
the
brightest
features
of
current
literature
treat
of
the
world
outside
a
city
s
limits
what
indeed
would
modern
novels
be
without
something
besides
brick
and
mortar
for
a
background
will
the
reader
become
enthusiastic
over
a
story
the
scenes
of
which
shift
only
from
brown
s
parlor
to
jones
s
and
back
again
the
thrifty
farmer
may
see
nothing
that
attracts
in
the
ballroom
and
fail
to
follow
the
thread
of
the
story
or
be
charmed
by
the
airs
of
an
opera
but
has
he
not
a
compensation
therefor
in
the
gothic
arches
of
his
woodland
beneath
which
tragedy
and
comedy
are
daily
enacted
and
what
of
the
songs
at
sunrise
when
the
thrush
the
grosbeak
and
a
host
of
warblers
greet
him
at
the
outset
of
his
daily
toil
town
and
country
are
interdependent
but
considered
calmly
and
in
all
its
bearings
does
not
the
former
ask
more
of
the
latter
than
vice
versa
has
not
the
influx
of
rural
vigor
an
incalculable
value
does
it
not
prevent
in
fact
the
very
destruction
of
the
city
by
checking
the
downward
course
that
artificiality
necessarily
takes
but
as
the
heading
of
this
article
indicates
i
do
not
propose
to
enter
into
any
controversy
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
city
or
country
life
but
simply
to
state
why
i
prefer
the
latter
and
may
all
those
to
whom
my
reasons
seem
insufficient
flock
to
the
towns
and
become
what
our
country
certainly
needs
good
citizens
i
prefer
an
oaktree
to
a
temple
grass
to
a
brick
pavement
wild
flowers
beneath
a
blue
sky
to
exotic
orchids
under
glass
i
would
walk
where
i
do
not
risk
being
jostled
and
if
i
see
fit
to
swing
my
arms
leap
a
ditch
or
climb
a
tree
i
want
no
gaping
crowd
when
i
do
so
to
hedge
me
in
in
short
i
prefer
living
next
neighbor
to
nature
i
am
free
to
admit
i
know
very
little
about
the
town
it
has
ever
been
a
cheerless
place
to
me
cold
as
charity
in
winter
hot
as
an
oven
in
summer
and
lacking
nearly
all
those
features
that
make
the
country
wellnigh
a
paradise
in
spring
and
autumn
vividly
do
i
recall
the
saddest
sight
in
my
experience
that
of
seeing
on
the
windowsill
of
a
wretched
tenementhouse
a
broken
flowerpot
holding
a
single
wilted
buttercup
and
near
it
was
the
almost
fleshless
face
of
a
little
child
to
be
indifferent
to
the
town
is
to
be
misanthropic
says
one
and
is
affectation
says
another
perhaps
so
i
neither
know
nor
care
it
concerns
me
only
to
know
it
is
the
truth
none
loves
company
better
than
i
but
may
i
not
choose
my
friends
if
i
prefer
my
neighbor
s
dog
to
my
neighbor
why
not
i
have
not
injured
him
and
if
harm
comes
of
it
it
is
the
dog
that
suffers
have
not
most
people
far
too
many
friends
hoping
to
please
all
you
impress
no
one
you
hold
yourself
up
as
a
model
and
the
chances
are
you
are
secretly
voted
a
bore
certainly
he
who
lives
where
human
neighbors
are
comparatively
few
and
far
between
runs
the
least
risk
of
social
disasters
but
there
is
a
deal
in
the
world
besides
humanity
worth
living
for
and
i
count
it
that
the
world
was
not
made
for
man
more
than
for
his
brute
neighbors
they
too
and
their
haunts
are
worthy
of
man
s
contemplation
is
it
spring
i
would
catch
the
first
whisperings
of
the
soft
south
wind
and
hug
the
precious
secret
known
save
to
the
flowers
only
to
myself
and
as
the
days
roll
by
would
watch
the
opening
leafbuds
one
by
one
and
greet
the
first
blossoms
peeping
above
the
dead
year
s
scattered
leaves
is
this
a
waste
of
time
if
so
how
is
it
then
that
the
earliest
spring
flowers
need
but
to
be
taken
to
town
to
set
the
people
one
and
all
agape
is
it
nothing
to
brighten
the
dull
eyes
of
the
weary
toilers
in
the
city
verily
a
violet
plucked
in
february
preaches
a
refreshing
sermon
and
yet
again
when
a
faint
shimmer
of
green
tints
the
wide
landscape
i
would
catch
the
earliest
note
of
the
returning
bird
as
it
floats
across
the
wide
meadow
or
rings
with
startling
clearness
through
the
wood
perchance
along
the
river
s
shore
i
would
hear
the
heaped
ice
crack
and
groan
as
the
breath
of
spring
snaps
its
bonds
and
sends
this
rugged
gift
of
winter
whirling
to
the
sea
is
it
summer
i
would
catch
the
fragrant
breeze
at
dawn
and
mark
the
day
s
beauteous
progress
step
by
step
gather
good
cheer
from
the
merry
thrushes
song
and
chirp
as
lustily
as
the
robin
though
my
task
be
long
even
at
noontide
be
it
never
so
sultry
i
would
take
heart
from
the
brave
fieldsparrow
s
hopeful
tone
and
lighten
my
labor
with
the
anticipation
of
long
hours
of
rest
when
the
world
s
best
gift
comes
to
the
fore
a
moonlit
summer
night
surely
it
is
something
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
year
s
ripening
harvest
for
nature
unfolds
many
a
secret
then
more
strange
than
any
fairy
tale
and
more
helpful
than
any
fevered
fancy
of
vague
theorist
armed
with
such
knowledge
the
countryman
is
well
equipped
to
solve
the
problem
of
his
life
and
does
not
the
toiler
in
the
town
ask
more
frequently
than
all
others
that
fearful
question
is
life
worth
living
is
it
autumn
the
recompense
for
bearing
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
year
s
long
day
is
ours
what
joy
to
contemplate
the
heapedup
treasures
of
a
fruitful
summer
and
know
they
are
yours
by
right
of
a
worthy
conquest
wherein
no
one
suffered
wrong
nor
is
nature
less
beautiful
or
less
communicative
now
indeed
i
hold
her
even
more
so
the
ruddy
tints
of
the
forest
leaf
mark
the
completion
of
a
summer
s
labor
to
which
we
have
given
little
heed
as
it
progressed
but
the
woodlands
invite
us
now
to
see
how
beautiful
as
well
as
useful
a
tree
may
be
and
open
their
doors
to
an
annual
exhibition
at
which
the
world
may
well
wonder
i
would
rather
have
the
autumn
landscape
before
my
door
than
its
counterfeit
on
canvas
hung
upon
the
wall
it
is
a
comfort
to
know
that
be
the
former
ever
so
gaudy
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
unnatural
thank
the
stars
critics
are
dumb
whatever
the
garb
nature
sees
fit
to
put
on
is
it
winter
in
a
broad
sense
the
world
is
now
at
rest
but
one
need
not
sit
down
and
mope
because
of
it
it
is
a
happy
lot
to
be
able
to
lead
a
contemplative
life
the
better
if
it
alternates
with
periods
of
activity
and
never
a
winter
so
dead
as
to
be
unsuggestive
not
even
though
the
rigor
of
an
arctic
one
be
upon
us
if
the
familiar
river
no
longer
flows
by
brimming
blue
and
sparkling
flecked
with
the
white
sails
of
busy
craft
or
fretted
with
the
tireless
splash
of
hissing
steamers
what
of
the
rugged
highway
it
becomes
for
the
wild
life
that
braves
the
north
wind
and
its
attendant
storms
whoso
studies
the
flocks
of
dainty
sparrows
that
throng
the
wide
windswept
wastes
in
winter
should
have
courage
enough
to
face
the
world
at
all
seasons
what
a
pulpit
becomes
a
cake
of
ice
whereon
a
treesparrow
is
singing
and
i
have
heard
hundreds
of
warbling
sparrows
when
the
day
was
cold
and
dreary
beyond
description
how
cheerless
are
the
leafless
oaks
these
the
strange
words
of
a
stormbound
visitor
cheerless
just
now
perhaps
but
wait
and
what
a
network
of
ruggedness
will
bar
the
deep
blue
sky
and
let
in
the
welcome
sunshine
where
the
gnarly
roots
afford
a
tempting
seat
it
is
winter
now
and
as
welcome
the
warmth
and
sunshine
in
this
little
nook
as
were
the
coolness
and
shade
in
the
leafy
month
of
june
and
what
a
merry
fate
is
his
who
is
snowbound
it
is
something
to
know
even
a
little
of
what
whittier
has
pictured
for
all
time
every
feature
of
a
great
snowstorm
is
a
living
poem
that
thrills
us
and
ever
dearest
of
all
the
open
fire
backlog
studies
think
of
them
everything
down
to
the
breaking
of
paths
to
the
highway
and
the
assurance
received
at
last
that
the
world
still
lasts
everything
when
snowbound
cuts
a
deep
notch
in
the
tallystick
of
your
memory
the
townsman
may
greet
me
with
a
pitying
smile
and
turn
with
disdain
from
the
pleasures
wherewith
i
am
pleased
but
nothing
that
he
offers
in
their
place
has
yet
tempted
me
to
forsake
the
idols
of
my
early
days
what
though
i
am
rough
as
the
gnarly
blackoak
s
bark
have
i
not
nature
for
my
next
neighbor
a
midsummer
outing
the
gentle
breeze
that
keeps
the
forest
roof
atremble
whispers
the
promise
of
a
cool
day
but
breaks
it
long
before
noontide
it
is
wise
therefore
to
trust
only
to
past
experience
and
if
you
ramble
at
all
during
the
dogdays
consider
yourself
in
the
tropics
and
act
accordingly
seek
the
shady
nooks
and
rest
content
to
contemplate
that
which
is
nearest
at
hand
he
has
traveled
much
who
spends
an
hour
in
the
woods
the
glamour
of
mystery
rests
as
a
veil
over
every
tree
and
shrub
and
who
has
yet
shown
why
the
wayside
weeds
are
all
so
brilliant
and
beautiful
where
except
the
damp
shades
of
night
no
cooling
shadows
ever
fall
even
the
welltraveled
highway
is
now
resplendent
with
stjohn
swort
or
white
as
with
a
snowdrift
where
the
blooming
yarrow
clusters
but
the
pitiless
sun
threatens
the
rambler
here
and
i
turn
to
the
little
forest
of
sumach
and
locust
which
now
nearly
obliterates
the
boundaries
of
a
longneglected
pasture
everywhere
is
outspread
the
luxuriance
of
the
tropics
acres
of
lilies
ruddy
and
golden
set
in
a
cloud
of
tall
meadowrue
and
this
wealth
of
gorgeous
bloom
upon
which
the
eyes
might
feast
the
summer
long
is
hedged
by
a
glossy
thicket
of
smilax
broken
here
and
there
only
to
give
place
to
a
no
less
rank
growth
of
pink
roses
my
neighbors
hold
the
place
a
disgrace
to
its
owner
but
i
have
long
since
cut
the
word
weed
from
my
vocabulary
in
midsummer
it
is
too
much
like
cataloguing
to
scan
overclosely
one
s
surroundings
general
impressions
are
all
that
one
should
aim
at
and
not
fret
if
many
a
flower
or
bird
should
escape
notice
when
it
is
ninety
in
the
shade
it
is
well
to
carry
even
a
light
load
of
thoughts
lilies
and
yarrow
for
instance
are
enough
for
a
hot
july
morning
and
i
am
quite
content
to
have
further
details
go
to
those
botanists
fearful
bores
who
love
not
the
flower
they
pluck
and
know
it
not
and
all
their
botany
is
latin
names
probably
there
was
waving
lizardtail
i
know
there
was
purple
milkweed
but
if
there
were
a
host
of
lesser
growths
it
availed
nothing
i
was
seated
in
a
bit
of
shade
and
from
my
cozy
nook
looked
out
at
my
leisure
upon
acres
of
lilies
and
when
their
fiery
tints
proved
too
bright
for
such
a
day
i
refreshed
my
sight
by
turning
to
the
yarrow
on
my
left
or
that
daintiest
of
blooming
shrubs
tall
meadowrue
is
this
too
objectless
a
way
to
spend
the
summer
should
an
outing
have
higher
aims
various
comments
that
reach
me
imply
that
view
but
i
enter
a
plea
for
such
laziness
whoso
contemplates
a
flower
logically
and
sees
not
only
it
but
all
that
it
represents
has
given
his
brain
but
little
rest
though
he
may
never
have
moved
a
finger
a
fig
for
the
loudmouthed
chatter
of
nonproductive
busybodies
it
was
not
long
before
the
fact
became
evident
that
this
sea
of
lilies
was
the
pathless
highway
of
a
busy
world
bees
wasps
and
many
a
creature
akin
to
them
hurried
by
tarrying
but
for
a
moment
here
and
there
ever
buzzing
their
displeasure
or
humming
sweet
satisfaction
as
on
they
rush
as
in
the
human
world
success
and
want
of
it
were
the
essence
of
the
steady
ramble
of
that
insect
metropolis
though
long
i
waited
not
a
bird
came
near
the
kingbirds
that
are
held
to
be
such
foes
of
the
honeybees
were
not
to
be
seen
nor
any
flycatchers
came
in
view
afar
off
in
the
shady
copse
i
could
hear
the
woodpeewee
lisp
its
languid
notes
and
nearer
a
fieldsparrow
trilled
its
winsome
lay
but
neither
dared
venture
to
the
open
meadow
it
was
the
insects
paradise
for
the
time
and
i
must
confess
soon
became
monotonous
but
i
struggled
against
tiring
of
the
wild
bees
hum
and
hoped
if
nothing
more
tasteful
offered
i
might
gather
a
bit
of
patience
if
dished
up
daintily
perhaps
it
can
be
swallowed
with
a
smiling
countenance
but
the
bare
drug
in
flytime
rouses
a
rebellion
i
singled
out
the
nearest
lily
and
armed
with
my
fieldglass
became
statistician
the
novelty
wore
off
directly
it
was
too
like
work
the
procession
of
bees
and
beelike
flies
that
visited
that
one
flower
was
not
to
be
counted
like
city
street
parades
the
bees
marched
in
every
direction
and
the
lily
was
simply
the
hub
of
a
wheel
with
innumerable
spokes
soon
however
the
monotony
was
broken
and
my
languishing
interest
revived
there
was
a
commotion
in
this
particular
nook
of
lilydom
i
cautiously
drew
near
and
found
a
noisy
hummingbird
then
nearer
and
found
it
no
bird
at
all
but
a
clearwinged
sphinx
and
was
not
ashamed
to
find
i
had
made
so
great
a
mistake
at
the
outset
there
is
no
great
harm
done
in
jumping
at
a
conclusion
if
we
follow
it
up
and
verify
or
correct
the
original
impression
certainly
at
a
little
distance
the
resemblance
is
very
marked
on
its
appearance
every
nearby
insect
seemed
to
take
umbrage
at
the
presence
of
the
clearwing
and
the
volume
of
sound
was
largely
increased
there
was
a
change
from
a
contented
hum
to
an
angry
buzz
this
change
was
readily
brought
about
i
found
by
agitating
the
lilies
with
a
switch
and
so
i
realized
more
clearly
than
ever
before
how
by
the
increased
velocity
of
the
wings
movements
an
insect
would
express
its
emotions
for
a
time
i
forgot
the
heat
and
the
glare
of
the
noontide
sun
and
walking
to
and
fro
i
roused
at
will
an
angry
roar
from
thousands
of
disturbed
bees
or
by
remaining
quiet
allowed
it
to
settle
into
the
drowsy
hum
of
contentment
but
the
unprotected
tropic
of
that
field
of
lilies
proved
too
great
a
strain
and
i
was
glad
to
seek
the
shelter
of
the
woods
and
what
a
change
is
wrought
by
a
few
degrees
of
temperature
here
i
found
the
hummingbirds
in
propriæ
personæ
but
they
would
not
hum
or
buzz
as
i
drew
near
or
retreated
and
proved
to
be
veritable
commonplaces
although
i
am
sure
their
nest
was
very
near
disgusted
with
their
unsuggestiveness
i
went
home
and
there
followed
up
the
subject
so
far
as
these
birds
are
concerned
covering
one
side
of
a
porch
is
a
thrifty
trumpet
creeper
now
in
full
bloom
here
come
the
hummingbirds
continually
morning
noon
and
night
and
here
i
heard
their
angry
buzz
and
could
see
it
too
i
think
in
the
motion
of
their
wings
it
needed
only
a
little
irritation
to
make
them
buzz
angrily
but
this
is
not
their
only
means
of
making
themselves
heard
they
can
squeak
quite
loudly
and
very
generally
do
if
the
flower
they
alight
upon
or
actually
enter
is
not
quite
to
their
satisfaction
i
used
to
think
that
the
wrens
were
the
quickest
tempered
of
all
our
birds
but
probably
the
hummingbirds
are
their
equals
in
this
respect
this
i
learned
from
a
pair
of
nesting
birds
but
today
this
terrible
tropical
july
day
i
had
the
other
fact
impressed
upon
me
that
not
alone
do
insects
express
their
feelings
by
the
movements
of
the
wings
it
is
true
also
of
the
hummingbird
a
word
about
knowledge
half
a
loaf
may
be
better
than
no
bread
but
such
a
rule
will
not
apply
to
all
matters
half
a
fact
is
not
better
than
ignorance
recently
not
very
far
from
new
york
the
boston
idea
of
naming
the
trees
in
the
public
grounds
painting
upon
narrow
boards
both
the
botanical
and
common
names
was
adopted
by
the
city
authorities
acer
rubrum
quercus
alba
red
maple
white
oak
and
so
on
were
nailed
to
the
various
trees
and
each
as
is
not
always
the
case
in
its
proper
place
while
the
work
was
in
progress
the
following
conversation
took
place
what
a
deal
of
money
is
spent
in
advertising
patent
medicines
and
such
stuff
nowadays
remarked
blank
to
his
friend
see
there
and
he
pointed
to
a
maple
properly
labeled
adding
that
s
some
new
bitters
or
a
salve
for
corns
i
suppose
no
it
isn
t
replied
double
blank
with
an
air
of
infinite
wisdom
these
boards
are
the
names
of
the
different
kinds
of
trees
nailed
up
for
the
benefit
of
the
ignorant
in
such
matters
here
s
another
one
and
don
t
you
see
it
gives
the
scientific
and
common
names
both
quercus
white
alba
an
oak
i
remember
that
much
latin
anyhow
is
it
true
that
life
is
too
short
to
acquire
decent
knowledge
of
natural
history
along
with
arithmetic
and
geography
and
what
profiteth
it
to
study
latin
if
such
a
display
of
ignorance
as
the
above
is
the
ultimate
outcome
botany
and
zoölogy
are
in
the
curriculum
of
many
lesser
institutions
than
colleges
but
from
the
manner
in
which
these
subjects
are
taught
in
some
places
they
would
better
be
omitted
these
two
worthy
citizens
whose
conversation
was
overheard
and
the
report
thereof
is
not
doctored
had
both
been
through
a
course
of
botany
and
one
of
them
had
struggled
through
a
latin
reader
there
is
undoubtedly
still
a
considerable
amount
of
prejudice
against
science
or
organized
common
sense
as
kingdon
clifford
has
happily
called
it
though
why
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
if
it
is
a
fact
that
birds
fly
and
fishes
swim
can
any
harm
come
of
knowing
it
and
of
how
and
why
they
fly
and
swim
and
a
step
further
if
some
birds
swim
instead
of
fly
and
certain
fishes
climb
trees
as
is
true
is
knowledge
of
the
fact
likely
to
prove
dangerous
yet
again
if
ten
thousand
facts
have
been
discovered
as
they
have
which
upset
the
ideas
of
our
grandfathers
need
we
tremble
i
trow
not
and
this
leads
me
to
a
word
also
about
newspaper
science
of
which
more
anon
what
wonderful
statements
creep
into
the
local
papers
impossible
snakes
no
less
impossible
birds
and
creatures
too
strange
for
even
the
nightmare
of
a
zoölogist
figure
now
and
then
as
captured
in
the
neighborhood
of
an
inland
town
yet
no
one
contradicts
the
reporter
or
sees
the
absurdity
of
it
all
the
mythical
hoopsnake
bespatters
the
patent
outsides
of
many
a
village
weekly
better
by
far
absolute
ignorance
than
half
the
truth
quercus
white
alba
an
oak
indeed
while
the
aforesaid
intellectual
status
causes
us
to
pity
our
fellows
and
at
times
to
laugh
at
their
expense
brazen
assumption
of
knowledge
which
is
far
more
common
is
often
positively
exasperating
what
a
sad
spectacle
yet
very
common
one
to
find
even
in
our
larger
towns
thousands
led
blindly
by
a
halfdozen
who
by
reason
of
brazen
assumption
have
stepped
forth
as
leaders
and
been
meekly
accepted
as
such
the
intellectual
status
of
many
a
village
is
sometimes
ludicrous
in
smalltown
there
live
a
lawyer
a
doctor
and
a
clergyman
who
are
great
cronies
past
sixty
and
puffed
up
with
pride
as
a
matter
of
course
they
rule
the
little
community
with
a
rod
of
iron
not
a
great
question
of
the
day
but
is
referred
to
some
one
of
the
three
or
to
all
and
nothing
concerning
the
past
comes
up
but
their
opinion
is
sought
and
relied
upon
no
one
ever
reaches
an
independent
conclusion
nor
thinks
for
a
moment
that
error
may
have
crept
in
when
the
past
is
discussed
the
noble
three
were
never
known
to
admit
their
ignorance
and
never
during
their
joint
reign
have
their
decisions
been
disputed
of
course
the
inhabitants
of
smalltown
see
as
through
a
glass
darkly
for
who
such
disseminators
of
untruth
as
those
who
lay
claim
to
universal
knowledge
may
a
recent
ray
of
light
that
recently
penetrated
their
darkness
tend
toward
their
awakening
it
happened
not
long
since
that
the
blacksmith
fell
ill
and
a
stranger
took
his
place
at
the
forge
this
newcomer
had
been
taught
his
trade
and
rightfully
prided
himself
that
he
thoroughly
understood
it
such
independence
nettled
the
village
clergyman
and
when
that
worthy
came
to
have
his
horse
shod
there
was
not
a
paring
of
the
hoof
driving
of
a
nail
or
stroke
of
the
hammer
but
under
his
explicit
direction
the
smith
was
patient
silent
and
obedient
but
all
the
while
there
was
a
dangerous
glitter
in
his
eyes
the
horse
went
lame
directly
and
that
fellow
is
an
ignorant
bungler
was
the
minister
s
outspoken
decision
that
was
monday
and
smalltown
moved
with
the
monotony
of
the
old
hall
clock
s
pendulum
until
sunday
morning
then
the
quiet
blacksmith
took
his
seat
in
church
near
the
door
and
sat
through
the
service
in
due
course
the
sermon
of
the
past
halfcentury
with
variations
was
preached
and
ended
with
the
usual
peroration
brethren
is
this
not
true
with
the
asking
of
that
question
smalltown
was
shaken
to
its
foundations
for
the
blacksmith
quickly
shouted
no
and
straightway
retired
that
minister
had
no
faith
in
the
skill
of
the
blacksmith
the
latter
placed
no
confidence
in
the
preacher
s
logic
i
do
not
defend
the
blacksmith
but
somehow
when
i
heard
the
story
i
was
otherwise
than
shocked
there
is
a
bit
of
harshness
in
it
perhaps
but
the
remark
must
needs
be
made
pin
not
too
much
faith
upon
defective
memory
and
it
may
be
rightfully
added
there
is
nothing
but
reasonableness
in
the
suggestion
that
he
who
presumes
to
know
all
things
is
no
safe
authority
upon
any
the
nightside
of
nature
not
long
since
i
checked
the
flow
of
a
diminutive
brook
that
barely
trickled
over
a
most
tortuous
course
and
during
midsummer
was
often
a
thing
forgotten
by
building
a
dam
i
raised
a
shallow
pond
about
two
hundred
feet
square
and
nowhere
more
than
eighteen
inches
deep
save
at
its
outlet
here
are
now
growing
beautiful
waterlilies
pink
yellow
blue
and
white
the
stately
lotus
and
many
a
pretty
aquatic
plant
from
foreign
lands
of
these
i
have
nothing
now
to
say
except
incidentally
but
a
good
deal
concerning
the
remarkable
zoölogical
features
of
this
artificial
pond
in
the
corner
of
an
exposed
upland
field
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
most
skillful
hunter
would
have
found
no
game
had
he
scoured
this
and
the
adjoining
fields
even
with
trained
dogs
no
trapper
would
have
deigned
to
set
a
snare
anywhere
about
the
place
and
the
naturalist
would
have
considered
the
outlook
most
unpromising
as
in
every
farming
district
here
were
acres
of
cornfields
wheatfields
truckpatch
and
pasture
and
nothing
but
grass
or
growing
crops
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
landscape
every
vestige
of
wildness
has
long
since
been
improved
off
the
face
of
this
region
and
grasshoppers
mice
and
fieldsparrows
constitute
the
fauna
that
is
apparently
so
and
how
readily
we
underrate
the
merits
of
the
socalled
commonplace
in
nature
the
truth
is
every
inch
of
these
unsuggestive
fields
has
ever
been
and
is
familiar
ground
to
hosts
of
cunning
creatures
or
how
else
could
the
pond
that
was
formed
in
a
few
days
have
become
tenanted
as
it
now
is
the
remarkable
promptness
with
which
every
nook
and
corner
was
occupied
by
some
waterloving
animal
almost
the
very
day
the
pond
was
formed
shows
how
much
is
overlooked
if
we
familiarize
ourselves
only
with
the
events
of
the
day
and
ignore
as
young
naturalists
are
all
too
apt
to
do
the
nightside
of
nature
if
the
reader
were
to
stand
on
the
bank
of
the
little
pond
early
in
the
morning
his
attention
would
doubtless
be
drawn
exclusively
to
the
lilies
and
the
skimming
barnswallows
or
fiery
dragonflies
that
outspeed
them
would
not
be
seen
here
and
there
the
waters
would
be
rippled
but
only
the
broad
leaves
of
the
lotus
trembling
in
the
breeze
would
catch
his
eye
yet
that
ripple
marks
the
progress
of
a
monstrous
watersnake
charmed
by
the
beauty
of
a
trailing
vine
that
rests
like
an
emerald
serpent
on
the
pond
s
placid
surface
the
deep
tones
of
enormous
frogs
will
be
unheard
yet
here
are
giants
of
their
race
that
quickly
found
the
spot
many
of
them
larger
and
more
musical
than
their
brethren
in
the
meadows
by
the
side
of
a
miniature
lily
from
siberia
scarcely
an
inch
in
width
may
pop
up
the
rugged
head
of
the
ferocious
snappingturtle
but
the
onlooker
will
see
only
a
bit
of
wood
floating
in
the
water
so
absorbed
is
he
in
the
wonderful
display
of
aquatic
bloom
now
this
is
not
an
imaginary
case
but
the
record
of
more
than
one
actual
occurrence
and
i
lay
stress
upon
the
particulars
because
it
shows
how
readily
we
overlook
so
much
that
is
well
worth
seeing
these
few
square
rods
of
shallow
water
go
not
so
much
to
make
a
lilypond
although
this
was
my
sole
intention
as
to
form
a
zoölogical
garden
on
a
quite
extensive
scale
let
us
consider
now
some
of
these
unbidden
and
unwelcome
occupants
of
the
pond
of
the
mammalian
life
first
in
bulk
as
well
as
destructiveness
is
the
muskrat
it
is
not
so
much
of
a
wonder
that
these
animals
so
soon
appeared
they
are
given
to
nocturnal
wanderings
this
is
the
nightside
of
their
nature
that
we
must
keep
in
mind
in
this
case
they
had
but
to
follow
the
windings
of
the
brook
for
a
thousand
yards
from
a
creek
where
they
have
always
been
to
reach
the
pond
the
curious
feature
of
their
coming
was
that
in
so
short
a
time
they
had
securely
established
themselves
they
seem
to
have
said
to
themselves
this
is
to
our
liking
and
without
delay
dug
their
underground
retreats
they
considered
the
pond
their
own
and
in
one
night
the
smooth
and
sodded
bank
was
marred
by
a
line
of
treacherous
hills
and
hollows
then
broad
leaves
and
thick
stems
of
lilies
began
to
float
about
cleanly
cut
from
the
parent
plant
the
culprits
were
well
known
yet
days
and
weeks
passed
without
one
being
seen
but
a
single
moonlit
night
sufficed
to
tell
me
what
i
had
guessed
their
hours
of
activity
are
when
men
are
supposed
to
be
asleep
the
wary
mink
too
came
nightly
to
the
pond
and
if
it
fished
in
the
waters
it
was
for
the
many
frogs
that
abounded
but
i
found
no
mangled
remains
of
the
old
fellows
that
outcroaked
the
myriads
in
the
meadows
then
rabbits
mice
and
squirrels
came
trooping
to
the
water
s
edge
stood
there
and
wondered
at
the
novelty
of
a
bit
of
the
meadows
being
brought
from
the
lowlands
to
this
dry
and
dusty
field
and
when
a
prowling
dog
came
by
how
with
one
wild
shriek
they
vanished
and
left
the
pond
to
the
bewildered
dog
and
myself
and
then
to
myself
only
for
the
dog
soon
turned
to
follow
the
trail
of
the
fleeing
rabbits
and
here
i
tarried
long
gazing
in
rapture
upon
the
lotus
by
moonlight
it
is
gordon
cumming
who
has
described
with
wonderful
vividness
how
herds
of
antelopes
and
elephants
and
even
many
lions
came
to
drink
at
night
from
pools
near
which
he
lay
concealed
what
a
boon
to
a
naturalist
to
see
these
mighty
beasts
under
such
circumstances
it
may
seem
very
absurd
to
think
of
one
when
speaking
of
the
other
and
ludicrous
to
compare
them
but
when
i
sat
concealed
by
the
little
lilypond
and
saw
these
little
animals
muskrats
rabbits
and
even
smaller
fry
come
to
the
water
s
edge
i
did
think
of
the
great
lionhunter
of
south
africa
and
honestly
believe
i
could
realize
even
more
vividly
than
when
i
read
his
thrilling
pages
what
he
had
seen
probably
no
feature
of
wild
life
is
so
characteristic
of
waterscenes
as
the
tall
wading
birds
herons
snipe
and
sandpipers
i
did
not
anticipate
the
coming
of
any
of
these
unless
it
might
be
the
little
teetering
sandpiper
that
is
practically
a
land
bird
but
it
has
kept
aloof
so
far
as
i
know
while
stately
herons
have
come
and
trod
the
grassy
shores
and
fished
in
the
shallow
depths
these
birds
are
not
a
feature
of
the
day
however
and
unless
you
are
abroad
after
sunset
you
would
not
suspect
their
presence
and
then
do
not
expect
too
much
probably
some
of
the
wonderful
stories
concerning
herons
bitterns
cranes
and
storks
have
come
to
your
notice
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
our
north
american
species
are
very
prosy
and
set
off
by
their
size
the
waterscape
far
more
than
they
embellish
it
by
wonderful
habits
it
is
true
they
are
expert
in
catching
frogs
crayfish
and
even
mice
but
however
bright
the
moonlight
you
can
see
next
to
nothing
of
all
this
the
facts
have
been
reached
from
dissection
more
than
observation
and
what
of
the
powderdown
patches
upon
a
heron
s
breast
the
fable
that
these
emit
light
and
illuminate
the
water
sufficiently
to
enable
the
bird
to
see
a
fish
in
the
water
is
still
repeated
and
a
greater
error
never
found
utterance
it
is
a
pretty
fancy
so
the
more
dangerous
as
it
crops
out
every
now
and
then
to
the
deceiving
of
the
unsuspecting
reader
i
have
spoken
of
a
monstrous
watersnake
this
serpent
has
long
been
a
feature
of
the
pond
and
when
in
the
upland
fields
laying
its
eggs
it
probably
smelled
the
water
and
so
turned
northward
toward
the
lilies
instead
of
returning
southward
to
the
splatterdocks
in
the
meadows
i
have
cornered
the
creature
several
times
and
always
found
it
exceedingly
surly
to
be
held
in
the
hand
it
considers
an
insult
and
bites
with
a
rapidity
of
motion
of
the
head
that
is
marvelous
its
teeth
are
pretty
sharp
too
and
bring
blood
when
the
hand
or
bare
arm
is
struck
but
then
its
violent
efforts
are
so
amusing
that
one
forgets
all
about
the
pain
the
snake
loves
a
moonlit
night
and
at
such
times
occasionally
floats
upon
the
surface
of
the
pond
without
making
the
slightest
motion
and
a
stranger
would
suppose
it
to
be
a
small
limb
of
a
tree
this
apparent
rest
however
has
a
purpose
behind
and
is
i
think
connected
with
the
capture
of
food
or
so
it
has
appeared
to
me
on
several
occasions
that
the
several
turtles
of
our
meadow
tracts
should
find
their
way
to
the
pond
was
not
surprising
for
even
those
most
strictly
aquatic
take
long
overland
journeys
in
spring
and
early
summer
but
i
did
not
look
for
fish
as
none
could
come
down
the
brook
and
i
as
little
supposed
that
any
could
climb
fifty
feet
above
the
river
and
reach
it
and
then
they
would
have
besides
to
jump
over
the
dam
or
waddle
around
it
and
i
saw
no
fish
until
weeks
after
the
pond
was
completed
i
stocked
it
with
carp
and
then
lo
there
were
mudminnows
in
these
shutoff
waters
of
course
they
were
there
before
the
dam
was
built
and
now
they
are
too
well
established
to
be
exterminated
i
can
only
hope
they
will
not
find
the
carps
eggs
or
feed
exclusively
on
the
young
fish
what
then
have
i
accomplished
by
damming
a
little
brook
i
have
changed
to
a
watery
wilderness
the
corner
of
a
onetime
dusty
field
i
have
brought
representatives
of
many
forms
of
animal
life
hitherto
unknown
to
the
spot
to
a
prosy
nook
and
so
changed
the
whole
face
of
nature
the
very
weeds
are
even
now
different
from
those
of
former
years
and
hosts
of
insects
that
had
not
been
here
before
now
fill
the
air
and
make
it
to
tremble
with
their
tireless
wings
and
to
the
rambler
after
long
tramping
in
dusty
fields
or
along
the
no
less
cheerless
highway
here
is
a
pleasant
spot
indeed
one
that
epitomizes
half
the
country
round
and
offers
too
many
a
suggestive
novelty
so
much
by
day
but
let
him
tarry
until
the
gloaming
and
when
the
lilies
have
folded
he
will
catch
what
is
even
better
glimpses
of
the
nightside
of
nature
the
herbs
of
the
field
wandering
recently
in
and
out
the
woods
and
fields
tramping
aimlessly
whithersoever
fancy
led
me
i
crushed
with
my
feet
at
last
a
stem
of
pennyroyal
catching
the
warm
fragrance
of
its
pungent
oil
straightway
the
littleloved
present
vanished
how
true
it
is
that
many
an
odor
however
faint
opens
the
closed
doors
of
the
past
prosy
and
commonplace
it
may
seem
but
full
many
a
time
a
whiff
from
the
kitchen
of
some
old
farmhouse
where
i
have
stopped
for
a
drink
of
water
recalls
another
farmkitchen
redolent
of
marvelous
gingerbread
and
pies
such
as
i
have
failed
to
find
in
recent
years
and
with
their
tempting
spiciness
went
that
subtle
odor
from
which
indeed
the
whole
house
was
never
free
that
of
sweetsmelling
herbs
i
am
daily
thankful
that
the
herbs
at
least
have
not
changed
as
the
years
roll
by
it
is
the
same
pennyroyal
that
my
grandmother
gathered
and
think
to
what
strange
use
she
put
it
made
pennyroyal
puddings
let
them
go
down
to
posterity
by
name
only
the
herbs
of
the
field
and
garden
were
gathered
each
in
its
proper
season
by
the
folks
at
home
and
in
great
bunches
were
suspended
from
the
exposed
beams
of
the
old
kitchen
in
early
autumn
they
made
quite
a
display
but
as
the
winter
wore
away
became
rather
sorrylooking
reminders
of
the
past
summer
to
a
limited
extent
their
bulk
decreased
and
their
odor
became
less
pronounced
but
how
seldom
were
they
ever
disturbed
i
have
dared
to
think
that
herbgathering
was
a
survival
from
prehistoric
times
but
i
never
dared
to
hint
this
to
my
grandmother
the
nearest
to
doing
this
was
to
coax
a
braver
boy
to
ask
if
the
old
bunches
were
burned
at
midnight
with
secret
ceremonies
for
they
gave
place
to
the
new
crop
each
year
yet
were
not
seen
lying
about
the
yard
neither
the
braver
boy
nor
i
could
get
any
satisfaction
but
a
forcible
reprimand
instead
for
hinting
at
paganism
i
hold
nevertheless
that
a
trace
of
it
did
exist
then
and
does
was
it
not
something
akin
to
this
that
more
than
one
medicinal
herb
had
to
be
gathered
at
midnight
this
it
is
true
was
not
openly
admitted
but
unquestionably
faith
in
its
virtue
as
a
remedy
was
diminished
if
the
plant
was
not
gathered
as
the
superstition
dictated
try
as
we
may
the
crude
faiths
of
our
prehistoric
ancestry
we
can
not
snap
asunder
as
elastic
bands
they
may
grow
finer
and
finer
with
the
tension
of
the
centuries
but
still
perhaps
as
but
invisible
threads
they
hold
however
steadily
herbusing
may
have
been
going
out
of
date
in
my
early
boyhood
herbgathering
was
not
and
i
may
be
mistaken
when
i
say
that
except
the
pennyroyal
in
puddings
sage
in
sausage
and
a
bit
of
thyme
and
parsley
in
soup
the
dozen
others
hung
in
old
kitchens
were
unused
except
as
flyroosts
a
fact
that
scarcely
added
to
their
virtues
when
i
last
lounged
on
the
old
settle
and
counted
the
several
kinds
of
herbs
hanging
overhead
an
aged
negress
assured
me
that
every
yarb
kept
some
disease
at
bay
and
predicted
disaster
as
the
new
kitchens
with
their
plastered
ceilings
and
modern
stoves
gave
way
to
more
primitive
architecture
and
methods
and
i
am
half
inclined
to
believe
that
she
was
right
the
old
folks
had
their
aches
and
pains
but
not
so
much
of
that
depressing
languor
that
we
call
malaria
might
not
the
everpresent
odors
of
sweetsmelling
herbs
have
kept
this
at
bay
i
fancied
i
felt
the
better
for
the
whiff
of
pennyroyal
and
gathering
a
handful
of
its
leaves
breathed
the
spiciness
until
my
lungs
were
filled
it
is
something
to
have
an
herb
at
hand
that
revives
the
past
and
more
perhaps
to
have
many
that
add
a
charm
to
the
present
for
the
pastures
in
august
would
be
somewhat
dreary
i
think
were
there
not
in
almost
every
passing
breeze
the
odor
of
sweetsmelling
herbs
but
if
pennyroyal
sweet
cicely
and
the
spicy
mocker
nut
carry
me
back
some
twoscore
years
what
shall
be
said
of
a
faint
odor
that
can
yet
be
distilled
from
plants
that
flourished
in
the
same
pastures
or
where
these
pastures
now
are
perhaps
a
million
years
ago
one
is
not
given
to
thinking
of
anthracite
as
at
one
time
wood
but
it
is
different
in
this
instance
for
the
blackened
fernlike
plants
in
the
underlying
clays
are
still
wood
and
not
petrified
so
that
they
burn
with
a
feeble
flame
when
dry
and
burning
throw
off
a
rich
fragrance
akin
to
frankincense
i
have
often
placed
a
splinter
of
these
ancient
trees
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
and
sniffing
the
odor
that
arises
travel
in
fancy
to
new
jersey
s
upland
and
meadows
before
they
were
trodden
by
palæolithic
man
before
even
the
mastodon
and
gigantic
beaver
had
appeared
when
enormous
lizards
and
a
few
strange
birds
ruled
the
wide
wastes
but
the
world
here
was
not
wholly
strange
even
then
for
many
a
familiar
tree
was
growing
in
this
old
river
valley
as
the
delicate
impressions
of
their
leaves
in
the
clay
so
clearly
demonstrate
if
then
one
would
indulge
in
retrospection
and
therein
lies
one
of
life
s
most
solid
comforts
it
will
be
found
that
suggestive
objects
are
ever
about
us
and
the
herbs
of
the
field
in
august
would
scarcely
be
missed
if
unhappily
they
ceased
to
grow
but
why
it
may
be
asked
are
these
same
herbs
so
suggestive
of
the
past
so
certain
to
give
rise
to
retrospective
thought
it
is
not
a
personal
matter
for
i
have
questioned
many
people
and
in
this
they
all
agree
one
reply
is
a
fair
representative
of
all
offering
a
little
bunch
of
garden
herbs
to
an
old
man
no
longer
able
to
wander
out
of
doors
he
immediately
buried
his
nose
in
it
drew
a
long
breath
and
remarked
how
that
carries
me
back
to
the
old
homestead
as
by
the
touch
of
a
magician
s
wand
in
my
walk
today
the
present
vanished
when
i
crushed
the
pennyroyal
and
the
ringing
songs
of
the
still
tuneful
summer
birds
were
not
exultant
strains
glorifying
the
present
but
echoes
of
a
dim
past
over
which
perhaps
i
am
too
prone
to
brood
it
is
absurdly
contradictory
of
course
to
say
that
i
love
retrospection
and
that
in
august
one
is
more
prone
to
think
of
the
past
than
the
present
and
yet
not
to
love
that
month
but
such
is
the
case
in
other
words
i
am
vacillating
and
contradictory
and
fail
to
command
the
words
that
might
set
me
right
before
the
world
but
it
is
august
now
and
summer
s
activity
ended
why
should
i
labor
to
think
why
not
build
aircastles
as
i
smell
the
herbs
of
the
field
build
and
unbuild
them
until
the
day
closes
and
later
lulled
by
the
monotones
of
cricket
and
katydid
hum
those
evermelancholy
lines
backward
turn
backward
o
time
in
your
flight
make
me
a
child
again
just
for
tonight
part
iv
in
autumn
a
lakeside
outing
having
been
within
the
city
s
bounds
for
a
week
for
me
a
novel
experience
that
has
little
merit
it
was
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
that
i
rode
a
short
distance
out
of
town
and
turning
my
back
upon
the
railway
station
started
with
a
few
friends
upon
an
oldtime
tramp
in
the
company
were
a
geologist
an
engineer
a
botanist
an
artist
and
others
who
like
myself
professing
nothing
were
eager
to
extract
the
good
from
everything
that
came
in
our
way
we
filed
along
the
dusty
highway
some
miles
from
toronto
with
lake
ontario
as
our
objective
point
there
was
not
a
feature
of
that
ancient
highway
that
differed
essentially
from
the
country
roads
at
home
the
same
trees
wayside
weeds
and
butterflies
met
me
at
every
turn
even
the
crickets
creaked
in
the
same
key
and
the
farmers
dogs
were
equally
inquisitive
for
more
than
a
mile
i
am
not
sure
that
i
saw
a
bird
of
any
kind
in
this
respect
we
are
surely
better
off
at
home
this
absence
of
novelty
was
a
little
disappointing
but
i
had
no
right
to
expect
it
canada
has
been
longer
settled
than
new
jersey
and
doubtless
many
a
field
we
passed
was
cleared
years
before
the
forest
was
felled
along
the
delaware
however
this
may
be
the
outlook
soon
changed
for
the
better
and
reaching
the
upper
terrace
or
ancient
shore
the
broad
and
beautiful
expanse
of
lake
ontario
lay
before
us
from
the
upper
to
the
lower
terrace
was
but
a
step
and
then
on
the
very
edge
of
a
precipitous
cliff
i
looked
over
to
see
the
waves
dashing
at
its
foot
and
carrying
the
loose
sand
and
clay
steadily
into
the
lake
clear
as
crystal
and
brightly
blue
the
waters
as
they
struck
the
shore
roily
and
heavy
laden
with
the
sand
as
they
receded
it
is
little
wonder
that
the
cliff
is
rapidly
yielding
there
is
nothing
to
protect
it
even
from
the
gentle
ripples
of
a
summer
sea
yet
wherever
spared
for
a
short
season
vegetation
came
to
the
rescue
and
the
yellowwhite
cliff
was
dotted
with
blooming
clusters
of
tansy
goldenrod
eupatorium
and
mullein
yellow
and
white
that
were
too
like
the
background
to
be
conspicuous
but
not
so
the
scattered
asters
which
were
large
and
very
blue
more
so
indeed
than
any
that
i
saw
elsewhere
the
proportion
of
clay
in
the
cliff
differed
exceedingly
and
where
it
was
greatly
in
excess
of
the
sand
had
withstood
the
destructive
action
of
wind
and
wave
and
stood
out
in
great
pillars
walls
and
turrets
that
suggested
at
once
the
ruins
of
ancient
lakeside
castles
leaving
the
cliff
not
because
weary
of
it
but
to
crowd
a
week
s
outing
into
an
hour
the
party
turned
to
a
deep
shady
vineentangled
ravine
i
was
happy
indifferent
to
the
geology
ably
explained
by
one
to
the
botany
by
another
to
the
beauty
as
extolled
by
the
artist
i
found
a
rustic
seat
and
feasted
upon
raspberries
to
eat
is
a
legitimate
pastime
of
the
confirmed
rambler
one
s
eyes
and
ears
should
not
monopolize
all
the
good
things
in
nature
but
these
again
were
not
neglected
for
i
stopped
eating
when
the
berries
gave
out
and
toyed
with
the
beautiful
seedpods
of
the
actæa
or
baneberry
this
i
never
find
near
home
and
so
its
novelty
gave
it
additional
merit
but
it
needs
no
extraneous
suggestiveness
the
deep
coralred
stems
and
snowwhite
seedpods
completely
captivated
my
fancy
bearing
this
as
a
prize
i
moved
slowly
over
a
pathless
wild
hearing
pine
finches
to
my
delight
and
above
all
other
sounds
the
muffled
roar
of
the
lake
as
it
beat
upon
the
narrow
beach
nearly
two
hundred
feet
below
me
at
last
i
was
in
a
strange
country
one
that
bore
not
the
remotest
resemblance
to
any
i
had
seen
before
there
was
no
time
to
tarry
however
attractive
any
spot
might
prove
and
next
in
order
having
seen
the
uplands
was
to
descend
to
the
foot
of
the
cliff
and
stroll
along
the
beach
i
was
assured
that
fortune
favored
us
as
near
by
was
a
wellworn
path
never
was
a
path
better
described
it
was
well
worn
smooth
as
a
tobogganslide
and
with
few
shrubs
or
sturdy
weeds
to
seize
in
case
of
accident
my
steps
were
clogged
with
fear
each
foot
weighted
with
a
painful
doubt
i
hate
to
run
a
risk
and
fear
so
strained
my
nerves
that
when
the
base
was
reached
every
muscle
ached
through
sympathy
if
we
limit
the
localities
to
sand
and
water
the
lake
was
an
ocean
on
a
small
scale
and
not
a
very
small
scale
either
sky
and
water
closed
in
the
earth
s
boundary
upon
three
sides
but
the
water
lacked
life
not
a
shell
not
an
insect
not
a
fish
had
been
tossed
upon
the
sand
nothing
but
sand
this
want
was
a
disappointment
for
the
gathering
of
flotsam
along
our
seacoast
is
a
neverending
source
of
pleasure
perhaps
had
there
been
recently
a
violent
storm
i
might
have
been
more
successful
but
probably
the
water
is
too
cold
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
comfort
to
have
land
and
water
about
one
free
from
every
trace
of
man
s
interference
thank
goodness
there
were
no
iron
piers
and
hideous
rows
of
booths
and
bathhouses
for
aught
one
could
see
the
indians
might
have
left
these
shores
but
yesterday
where
we
now
strolled
the
cliff
had
been
spared
for
several
years
and
a
rank
vegetation
covered
it
from
base
to
top
squatty
willows
and
dwarf
sumachs
goldenrod
and
chess
a
wild
grass
that
recalled
the
graceful
plumes
of
the
panicum
crusgalli
at
home
these
held
the
winds
at
bay
but
were
likely
when
next
it
stormed
to
be
carried
out
to
sea
and
with
them
tons
of
the
cliff
upon
which
they
grew
as
so
many
of
the
rank
growths
near
by
were
heavy
with
seed
it
was
and
is
an
unsolved
puzzle
why
there
should
have
been
a
complete
absence
of
birds
everything
that
an
ornithologist
would
say
seedeating
birds
required
was
here
in
profusion
yet
the
birds
were
not
already
the
summer
migrants
had
departed
i
found
many
warblers
and
flycatchers
nests
and
the
winter
birds
of
the
region
had
not
yet
appeared
from
what
i
saw
this
day
and
afterward
in
other
localities
i
am
well
convinced
that
taking
the
year
through
there
is
no
spot
east
of
the
alleghanies
in
the
united
states
where
birds
are
so
abundant
as
in
the
valley
of
the
delaware
i
have
seen
since
my
return
more
birds
of
many
kinds
in
one
halfhour
at
home
than
i
saw
during
two
weeks
rambles
in
canada
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
climb
up
the
cliff
the
descent
of
which
was
still
impressed
upon
my
memory
but
the
order
to
march
came
from
the
guide
and
we
struggled
slowly
up
the
wellworn
path
if
a
brief
rest
had
not
been
permitted
i
should
have
rebelled
but
we
were
fortunate
in
this
and
never
did
lake
look
lovelier
than
in
the
golden
lightning
of
the
sunken
sun
it
was
with
regret
that
we
turned
our
faces
landward
and
crossed
prosy
fields
and
even
longed
for
the
bright
waters
while
threading
a
fragment
of
canadian
forest
here
too
silence
brooded
over
nature
not
even
a
chickadee
flitted
among
the
branches
of
the
sturdy
oaks
and
maples
nor
a
woodpecker
rattled
the
rough
bark
of
towering
white
pines
as
we
reached
the
public
road
and
stopped
for
supper
at
an
old
wayside
inn
three
silent
crows
passed
by
high
overhead
they
were
flying
in
a
southeasterly
direction
and
i
watched
them
long
and
wondered
if
they
were
bound
for
the
faroff
meadows
at
home
where
hundreds
of
their
kind
gather
daily
as
the
sun
goes
down
dew
and
frost
at
sunrise
today
by
reason
of
the
dew
the
whole
earth
was
beautiful
every
harsh
outline
was
softened
to
comely
roundness
not
even
an
ungainly
fence
scarred
the
landscape
instead
of
nature
tortured
out
of
shape
the
outlook
was
as
a
peep
into
a
fairyland
and
all
by
reason
of
the
glittering
dew
what
is
dew
says
the
physical
geography
at
hand
when
at
night
the
earth
radiates
the
heat
which
it
has
received
during
the
day
the
surface
becomes
colder
than
the
ground
beneath
or
the
air
above
vapor
rises
from
the
moist
soil
below
to
be
condensed
at
the
cooler
surface
the
adjacent
layer
of
air
above
is
also
cooled
to
its
point
of
saturation
and
its
vapor
is
deposited
this
condensed
moisture
at
the
surface
whether
from
the
soil
or
the
air
is
dew
dew
does
not
fall
but
is
condensed
on
the
best
radiators
such
as
grass
and
trees
going
no
further
into
explanations
let
us
consider
the
dewy
morn
as
we
find
it
what
of
this
early
bright
transient
and
chaste
moisture
that
bathes
the
world
alike
no
it
does
not
by
the
way
many
a
spot
is
dry
as
powder
while
elsewhere
all
is
dripping
it
does
not
do
to
make
sweeping
assertions
even
about
such
a
phenomenon
as
this
you
will
stir
the
lurking
critic
in
his
den
if
you
do
and
what
a
fell
catastrophe
but
today
october
d
the
dry
spots
are
to
be
looked
for
so
scattered
are
they
and
practically
everywhere
are
sparkling
globules
of
pure
water
finding
the
world
so
it
becomes
the
essential
business
of
the
rambler
to
determine
its
effects
are
the
birds
chilled
to
silence
does
the
fieldmouse
shiver
in
his
grassy
nest
i
think
not
often
have
i
wished
to
detect
some
marked
evidence
of
the
influence
of
dew
but
my
sluggish
senses
have
failed
me
up
from
the
glistening
expanse
of
weedy
meadows
comes
the
blithe
song
of
the
sparrow
out
from
the
misty
depths
of
the
river
valley
floats
the
triumphant
cawing
of
the
crow
the
bluebird
greets
the
dawn
with
prophetic
warble
promising
the
brightness
of
summer
when
the
dew
has
gone
and
chill
though
the
night
has
been
the
twittering
swifts
are
alert
and
aloft
at
daybreak
whether
there
be
dew
or
none
it
seems
to
matter
nothing
to
the
birds
but
it
is
a
veritable
telltale
so
far
as
the
early
stirring
mammals
are
concerned
they
can
never
move
so
daintily
that
the
dewdrops
are
not
brushed
aside
and
the
long
lines
of
swept
herbage
stand
out
in
boldest
relief
as
the
sunlight
sweeps
across
the
field
one
can
now
track
the
belated
creature
to
his
home
most
marked
of
all
the
effects
of
a
heavy
dew
is
the
beading
of
a
spider
s
web
a
more
exquisite
object
than
a
dewspangled
gossamer
i
have
never
seen
within
a
week
i
saw
a
single
silken
strand
that
reached
a
rod
in
length
and
not
a
break
was
there
in
the
row
of
sparkling
beads
that
clung
to
it
at
the
same
time
from
rail
to
rail
of
the
roadside
fence
were
stretched
the
marvelous
weavings
of
the
geometric
spider
and
every
horizontal
thread
was
dewladen
i
waited
until
the
sun
broke
through
the
bank
of
clouds
in
the
east
anticipating
a
splendid
exhibition
nor
was
i
disappointed
alas
that
language
is
so
inadequate
to
one
s
needs
when
such
magnificence
is
before
us
what
the
spiders
may
think
of
dew
remains
to
be
determined
as
i
prodded
several
of
them
and
forced
them
to
the
fore
they
were
a
sorrylooking
set
and
shook
their
webs
and
themselves
in
a
disconsolate
way
as
though
chilled
to
the
core
an
hour
later
as
i
passed
by
their
energy
had
revived
and
now
what
of
dew
as
a
weather
sign
i
turn
to
the
weather
proverbs
that
have
been
gathered
and
made
into
a
little
book
signal
service
notes
no
ix
and
find
the
sum
and
substance
of
fourteen
sayings
to
be
that
dew
in
summer
and
autumn
is
indicative
of
fair
days
the
absence
of
it
of
rain
if
your
feet
you
wet
with
the
dew
in
the
morning
you
may
keep
them
dry
for
the
rest
of
the
day
it
is
a
comfort
to
know
that
a
modicum
of
truth
lies
in
some
of
the
sayings
in
everybody
s
mouth
and
certainly
a
dewy
morn
is
likely
to
be
followed
by
a
dry
and
sunny
noon
nevertheless
do
not
expect
to
notch
off
your
three
score
and
ten
years
without
a
failure
in
these
sayings
euripides
never
hit
the
nail
more
squarely
on
the
head
than
when
he
wrote
what
tomorrow
is
to
be
human
wisdom
never
learns
sooner
or
later
in
october
we
have
frost
the
beautiful
dewy
morning
two
days
ago
was
followed
today
by
a
no
less
beautiful
morning
but
the
meadows
were
gray
with
frost
says
the
physical
geography
when
the
weather
is
cold
so
that
but
little
vapor
can
be
carried
in
the
air
the
dewpoint
may
be
below
degrees
fahrenheit
in
this
event
what
is
deposited
is
solid
frost
the
third
day
comes
a
frost
a
killing
frost
and
whatever
it
might
have
killed
it
compensated
therefor
by
adding
life
to
the
air
despite
its
beauty
the
country
was
reeking
with
an
unseen
unsuspected
poison
but
one
none
the
less
sure
in
its
fell
effects
how
different
today
there
is
evidence
of
vigor
so
widely
spread
that
the
blighted
leaves
and
drooping
blossoms
may
well
be
overlooked
no
sounds
are
muffled
the
faintest
chirping
of
a
distant
bird
falls
sharply
on
the
ear
the
loose
bark
of
the
nut
trees
snaps
and
crackles
at
the
squirrel
s
touch
and
not
a
tiny
twig
breaks
in
the
timid
rabbit
s
path
but
we
plainly
hear
it
the
languor
that
held
spellbound
the
woods
and
fields
fled
with
the
coming
of
that
killing
frost
well
can
we
spare
the
daintier
bloom
of
summer
seeing
how
great
a
train
of
blessings
follows
in
the
wake
of
frost
there
is
a
widespread
impression
that
animal
life
is
affected
almost
to
the
same
extent
as
vegetation
by
these
socalled
killing
frosts
this
is
not
true
insects
are
benumbed
by
it
but
recover
before
noon
frogs
and
salamanders
are
silenced
and
sluggish
but
the
morning
sun
renews
their
vigor
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
frostbitten
bird
on
the
contrary
scarcely
an
hour
after
the
sun
rose
on
october
th
there
were
a
dozen
birds
that
moping
and
peevish
had
petulantly
chirped
for
weeks
and
now
sang
gayly
later
there
was
an
oldtime
concert
in
the
hillside
thicket
even
a
brown
thrush
singing
half
his
mayday
song
nature
is
renewed
by
a
killing
frost
it
destroys
the
old
to
give
place
to
the
new
and
this
early
autumn
life
that
makes
glorious
october
and
softens
the
gloom
of
november
has
charms
too
little
heeded
the
world
does
not
need
to
be
embowered
in
green
leaves
to
tempt
the
rambler
he
who
lives
out
of
town
well
knows
how
many
are
the
frosty
days
when
the
uplands
and
meadows
alike
teem
with
myriad
forms
of
happy
life
a
hermit
for
the
day
a
peculiarly
disagreeable
northeast
storm
continuing
for
some
time
kept
me
out
of
the
woods
and
it
was
long
after
the
october
moon
had
fulled
that
my
opportunity
came
then
i
turned
hermit
for
the
day
i
question
if
it
matters
much
at
what
time
of
year
you
turn
your
back
upon
civilization
and
take
to
the
woods
they
will
greet
you
kindly
at
all
seasons
if
by
reason
of
your
delay
they
do
not
charm
you
with
spring
flowers
they
have
cool
shades
to
offer
when
the
dogstar
rages
and
following
these
a
carnival
of
color
and
harvest
of
sweet
nuts
if
you
have
tarried
in
town
too
long
for
these
then
plunge
into
the
forest
at
midwinter
and
sheltered
by
a
sturdy
oak
build
your
campfire
do
this
and
if
you
return
without
a
harvest
of
new
thoughts
the
chances
are
that
you
have
turned
up
on
the
wrong
planet
the
best
means
of
realizing
what
others
have
enjoyed
or
suffered
is
to
taste
of
their
experience
i
know
of
hermits
from
hearsay
only
and
i
wished
to
test
the
accuracy
of
what
i
had
heard
and
read
concerning
them
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
my
quicklaid
scheme
i
renounced
the
world
at
midnight
and
laden
with
a
blanket
and
provisions
started
long
before
sunrise
for
a
hollow
sycamore
miles
deep
in
a
lonely
swamp
of
what
i
was
to
do
when
i
reached
the
proposed
goal
i
had
no
idea
the
one
controlling
purpose
was
to
get
not
out
of
the
world
but
on
one
of
its
edges
trudging
halfheartedly
along
the
silence
of
midnight
clogs
one
s
energy
i
reached
before
dawn
the
confines
of
that
lonely
swamp
as
seen
by
the
dim
light
of
the
drowsy
stars
there
was
little
to
tempt
me
to
enter
although
the
now
scarcely
discerned
wood
road
that
crossed
it
was
familiar
enough
what
if
there
was
no
real
danger
and
he
is
a
coward
who
turns
from
an
imaginary
foe
still
the
imagination
persists
in
peopling
a
forest
with
most
strange
shapes
shapes
at
which
one
shudders
and
yet
contradictory
as
we
are
we
give
no
heed
to
hosts
of
creatures
daily
about
us
that
are
far
more
marvelous
if
i
had
any
purpose
whatever
in
this
unusual
outing
it
was
to
study
wild
life
and
now
because
the
dry
twigs
cracked
loudly
and
the
chafing
branches
overhead
groaned
dolorously
i
was
disposed
to
forget
that
it
was
my
own
feet
that
broke
the
former
and
the
wind
that
moved
the
treetops
what
a
fool
man
can
be
upon
occasion
be
it
on
record
however
that
the
woods
were
entered
and
many
a
rod
was
measured
with
firm
steps
when
at
a
turn
in
the
road
a
flickering
sickly
light
danced
in
the
foreground
a
gypsy
camp
i
thought
and
how
still
i
stood
then
while
staring
steadily
at
the
pallid
flame
i
saw
there
was
no
one
near
it
and
the
truth
flashed
upon
me
it
was
merely
a
willo
thewisp
i
laughed
at
my
blunder
so
did
an
owl
woorooroo
shouted
the
feathered
imp
in
my
ears
never
was
sound
more
welcome
now
i
was
well
at
home
a
hermit
for
a
day
loves
company
this
i
learned
and
the
little
red
owl
and
i
are
old
friends
i
took
his
hooting
as
a
hearty
welcome
and
with
lighter
steps
followed
the
crooked
wood
road
now
every
sound
excited
curiosity
no
doubt
and
when
this
is
true
a
walk
in
the
woods
be
it
night
or
day
is
an
unmixed
delight
later
as
the
pale
gray
dawn
sifted
its
meager
light
through
the
trees
i
paused
at
many
a
familiar
tree
and
shrub
all
regrets
had
vanished
and
i
bade
the
swamp
good
morning
with
a
hearty
shout
when
the
old
sycamore
loomed
up
before
me
its
scattered
leaves
gilded
by
the
herald
rays
of
the
slowly
rising
sun
there
was
scarcely
a
dozen
rods
between
us
but
that
much
of
my
journey
was
not
to
be
accomplished
a
huge
old
maple
had
fallen
across
the
road
the
course
of
a
little
creek
had
recently
been
changed
and
bees
were
swarming
about
the
hollow
tree
it
was
plain
that
i
must
seek
a
new
hermitage
but
why
any
particular
spot
there
was
no
tree
so
inhospitable
as
to
refuse
me
a
shelter
but
why
seek
shelter
at
all
under
an
unclouded
sky
placing
my
burdens
on
a
mossy
knoll
i
sat
down
now
i
thought
i
am
a
hermit
and
perhaps
a
fool
the
latter
thought
nettled
me
but
what
could
i
do
still
i
vowed
that
i
would
not
return
emptyhanded
i
had
met
nature
halfway
would
she
make
like
advances
clickclickclatter
so
it
sounded
and
i
cut
my
meditations
short
the
work
of
the
hermit
was
i
hoped
about
to
commence
chatter
clatter
everywhere
as
if
every
twig
were
busy
nor
was
all
this
varied
volume
of
sound
derived
from
but
one
source
there
were
squirrels
overhead
and
chipmunks
among
the
dead
leaves
two
downy
woodpeckers
were
scanning
in
close
company
the
dead
limb
of
an
old
oak
and
flitting
everywhere
were
scores
of
kinglets
and
warblers
a
host
of
treesparrows
and
whitethroated
finches
filled
the
chinkapin
shrubbery
while
dearest
of
all
a
brave
blackcapped
titmouse
came
almost
within
reach
looked
me
boldly
in
the
face
and
twittered
good
morning
it
was
worth
all
the
drawbacks
of
being
a
temporary
hermit
to
be
greeted
so
cordially
it
is
true
the
woods
are
never
quite
deserted
and
yet
it
is
not
in
them
that
birds
most
congregate
but
here
this
day
were
more
birds
immediately
about
me
than
i
ever
saw
before
more
treesparrows
directly
from
canada
than
i
saw
in
all
my
tramps
there
two
months
ago
and
certainly
more
kinglets
than
i
ever
saw
before
the
chilly
northeast
storm
doubtless
had
something
to
do
with
this
abundance
of
birds
but
this
matters
not
here
were
birds
in
abundance
what
can
they
teach
me
to
think
that
with
one
glance
of
the
eye
more
canadian
sparrows
could
be
seen
than
i
found
in
all
my
canadian
tramps
two
months
ago
and
they
had
all
the
freshness
too
of
this
brisk
october
morning
there
was
no
listlessness
however
long
their
journey
may
have
been
snap
crackle
these
crisp
words
best
describe
their
songs
and
movements
and
when
life
snaps
and
crackles
whether
it
is
our
own
or
that
of
other
creatures
it
is
life
worth
living
so
marked
is
the
difference
between
bird
life
now
as
compared
with
what
we
see
of
it
in
may
that
the
same
species
are
scarcely
to
be
recognized
as
such
this
is
peculiarly
true
when
the
spring
and
autumn
plumage
are
different
as
in
the
case
of
bobolinks
that
now
are
flitting
southward
as
yellowbrown
reedbirds
with
our
recent
arrivals
as
well
as
alltheyearround
birds
it
is
now
a
season
of
fun
and
feasting
life
has
few
cares
for
them
for
months
to
come
and
they
appreciate
the
fact
it
was
the
old
story
i
was
seeing
too
much
had
i
not
kept
in
the
background
the
day
would
have
teemed
with
adventure
but
i
should
have
been
less
of
a
hermit
it
was
hard
to
single
out
some
one
small
bird
among
a
hundred
i
turned
from
whitethroats
to
kinglets
from
woodpeckers
in
the
trees
to
chewinks
on
the
ground
but
everywhere
there
was
no
end
of
bustle
if
not
confusion
silent
woods
indeed
no
city
could
have
shown
a
busier
thoroughfare
than
the
interlocking
branches
of
the
trees
the
stock
exchange
was
never
noisier
than
when
a
crowd
of
grakles
came
rushing
from
the
outer
world
and
settled
in
a
little
cluster
of
white
pines
here
seemed
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
yet
i
was
puzzled
to
know
what
to
do
to
merely
catalogue
the
species
as
they
came
in
view
would
have
been
absurd
to
say
that
a
flock
of
this
or
that
species
was
feeding
in
the
tree
tops
is
equally
uncalled
for
would
there
never
come
some
startling
incident
it
came
that
moment
a
swiftwinged
hawk
dashed
through
the
trees
i
fancied
i
felt
the
fanning
of
his
wings
upon
my
face
but
better
than
all
i
saw
something
of
the
swifter
tactics
of
threatened
birds
their
darting
earthward
was
simply
marvelous
their
clinging
to
the
under
side
of
branches
was
wonderful
but
above
all
the
instantaneous
recognition
of
danger
and
promptness
to
find
a
safe
shelter
struck
me
after
all
the
sense
of
danger
was
ever
present
with
these
happygolucky
birds
unless
there
was
such
a
sense
controlling
them
their
movements
could
not
have
been
so
efficacious
and
so
wholly
free
from
confusion
here
is
no
loose
interpretation
that
profound
critics
love
to
dwell
upon
one
has
but
to
see
a
host
of
birds
and
if
of
several
species
so
much
the
better
to
recognize
how
busily
their
brains
keep
working
that
the
dangers
really
ever
in
attendance
shall
not
rob
them
of
all
comfort
never
shall
i
forget
one
tiny
kinglet
that
squatted
upon
the
blanket
at
my
feet
its
wings
were
outspread
and
looking
directly
up
it
seemed
in
utter
despair
but
the
shadow
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
and
when
i
innocently
stooped
to
pick
up
and
soothe
the
kinglet
it
was
too
much
itself
again
and
sped
away
as
cheerily
as
though
nothing
had
happened
what
next
i
asked
after
a
moment
s
quiet
for
the
kaleidoscopic
effect
of
evershifting
flocks
of
busy
birds
soon
became
monotonous
i
longed
for
hawks
at
the
rate
of
one
every
ten
minutes
at
least
so
firmly
fixed
is
one
s
desire
for
adventure
but
the
hawks
came
not
instead
that
matchless
songster
of
sweet
summer
days
appeared
and
made
the
woods
ring
with
his
sharp
metallic
click
how
i
longed
for
his
mayday
melodies
but
no
he
chirped
and
teazed
and
then
as
if
ashamed
warbled
a
few
faultless
notes
and
away
he
sped
the
whole
host
of
finches
caught
the
magic
of
that
song
and
every
white
throat
whistled
at
his
best
up
from
the
woods
rose
a
swelling
volume
of
sweet
sound
that
should
have
bid
murder
pause
it
only
brought
destruction
upon
their
heads
again
a
rush
of
wings
a
dark
streak
across
the
sky
and
every
bird
was
silent
but
their
plans
varied
in
this
when
the
danger
had
passed
they
seemed
of
one
accord
too
insecure
at
this
spot
and
left
me
to
my
meditations
here
again
was
a
noticeable
feature
of
bird
life
either
each
group
had
its
leader
or
every
individual
was
at
the
same
moment
impelled
by
a
like
thought
to
seek
safety
and
all
in
one
direction
this
is
improbable
and
certainly
the
fact
of
like
species
flocking
indicates
that
they
find
good
in
association
and
have
means
of
communication
for
without
some
sort
of
language
flocking
would
be
a
source
of
danger
this
has
been
shown
however
time
and
again
birds
have
language
and
an
abundance
of
forethought
and
so
are
better
worth
study
than
some
would
have
us
believe
the
woods
were
now
for
the
first
time
really
silent
i
listened
for
several
minutes
but
could
detect
no
sound
and
was
delighted
at
last
when
the
wind
sprang
up
and
rustled
the
dead
leaves
then
a
faint
chirp
was
heard
and
a
chickadee
came
within
arm
s
reach
its
busy
search
for
food
reminded
me
that
i
had
brought
food
with
me
and
i
sat
down
to
eat
tossing
the
crumbs
before
me
they
were
scrutinized
by
the
little
bird
but
not
closely
and
i
was
myself
more
the
object
of
its
curiosity
how
i
longed
for
it
to
perch
upon
me
but
it
would
not
and
my
opportunity
for
a
pretty
story
was
lost
birds
do
not
like
solitude
where
there
is
one
chickadee
rest
assured
another
is
not
far
off
and
soon
there
were
two
before
me
and
now
i
would
that
some
critical
knowall
would
tell
us
the
meaning
of
such
an
action
as
this
these
chickadees
came
together
they
faced
each
other
twittered
faintly
in
each
other
s
ears
then
looked
directly
toward
me
then
came
nearer
and
alighting
on
a
branch
not
three
feet
from
my
head
looked
down
at
me
twittering
all
the
while
would
they
have
done
this
had
i
been
a
stump
were
they
not
discussing
me
he
who
says
they
were
not
may
be
a
thorough
naturalist
but
he
is
something
besides
no
matter
what
and
the
chickadees
passed
by
but
the
woods
proved
not
an
aviary
only
i
have
spoken
of
squirrels
there
were
rabbits
mice
and
a
stray
mink
also
there
and
what
host
of
hidden
creatures
furred
and
feathered
we
shall
never
know
the
heyday
of
the
wood
s
wild
life
however
was
wellnigh
over
it
was
past
noon
and
rest
was
the
order
of
the
hour
what
creatures
i
saw
moved
with
great
leisure
as
if
annoyed
that
they
had
to
move
at
all
the
mink
crept
along
a
prostrate
log
as
though
stiff
in
every
joint
but
when
at
the
end
of
his
short
journey
i
whistled
shrilly
with
what
animation
it
stood
erect
and
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
how
evident
that
this
feature
of
the
sense
of
direction
is
well
developed
half
concealed
as
i
was
the
mink
saw
nothing
to
rouse
its
suspicions
it
was
merely
curious
or
puzzled
it
was
thinking
here
was
an
occurrence
beyond
the
range
of
its
experience
what
did
it
mean
the
mink
did
not
move
a
muscle
but
stared
at
me
then
i
commenced
whistling
in
a
low
tone
and
the
animal
became
more
excited
it
moved
its
head
from
side
to
side
as
if
in
doubt
and
needed
but
a
slight
demonstration
upon
my
part
to
convert
this
doubting
into
fear
i
whistled
more
loudly
and
moved
my
arms
in
an
instant
the
mink
disappeared
there
was
not
in
this
case
a
single
act
upon
the
part
of
the
animal
that
differed
from
a
timid
and
at
the
same
time
inquisitive
child
and
however
much
others
may
demur
i
consider
the
mental
activity
the
same
in
each
long
before
sunset
the
sky
became
clouded
the
shadows
in
the
wood
were
deepened
and
wild
life
was
better
heard
than
seen
then
the
resounding
raindrops
striking
the
crisp
leaves
dulled
all
other
sounds
and
bade
me
seek
refuge
i
had
not
long
to
search
and
without
hesitation
pushed
through
a
jagged
opening
into
a
huge
hollow
maple
it
is
seldom
that
such
convenient
shelters
are
unoccupied
certainly
this
one
was
not
spiders
in
that
hollow
tree
how
they
came
and
glared
at
me
on
trembling
bridges
overhead
to
and
fro
in
anger
sped
but
the
fear
they
would
arouse
while
unbidden
in
their
house
failed
my
stubborn
nerves
to
touch
though
they
threatened
overmuch
from
the
moss
with
glittering
eye
mottled
snake
went
gliding
by
with
its
forkéd
tongue
thrust
out
wondered
what
i
was
about
standing
in
the
hollow
tree
wildlife
s
home
this
century

uncanny
forms
slimy
slippery
noisome
worms
from
the
cracks
and

there
startled
each

and
crawled
above

threatened
me
with
direst
woe
if
i
chanced
to
cross
their
path
if
i
dared
excite
their
wrath
from
a
distant
nook
afar
gleaming
like
a
double
star
eyes
of
owlet
full
of
fire
questioned
my
insane
desire
here
within
the
tree
to
stand
trespassing
on
wildlife
s
land
why
not
in
the
outer
world
this
the
question
at
me
hurled
but
i
stubbornly
refused
to
be
other
than
amused
nor
till
night
i
bent
my
way

for
the

snowbirds
if
my
memory
serves
me
no
tricks
i
have
never
known
an
october
without
snowbirds
this
year
they
appeared
as
early
as
the
second
day
and
as
i
have
seen
them
daily
since
it
has
been
a
source
of
wonder
that
they
should
ever
have
been
called
snowbirds

which
the
swedes
call
snowbird
and
the
english
chuckbird
came
into
the
houses
about
this
time
jan
at
other
times
they
sought
their
food
along
the
roads
they
are
seldom
seen
but
when
it
snows
the
same
author
thirty
pages
further
on
says
the
english
called
it
snowbird
and
the
reason
is
that
it
is
only
seen
in
winter
when
the
fields
are
covered
with
snow
this
impression
which
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
was
correct
when
kalm
wrote
still
prevails
and
yet
there
is
not
a
tittle
of
reason
for
associating
the
bird
with
snow
as
there
is
with
the
snowbunting
an
arctic
bird
that
you
may
or
may
not
see
when
the
snowstorms
come
neither
wilson
nor
audubon
gives
any
reason
for
such
a
name
and
what
has
been
written
since
is
of
little
moment
wilson
s
reference
to
one
phase
of
the
bird
s
habits
would
make
the
name
snowbird
more
appropriate
but
wilson
repeated
illconsidered
hearsay
in
this
case
for
these
birds
care
less
about
weather
changes
than
many
another
they
enjoy
a
foul
day
whether
it
rains
or
snows
and
hunt
for
food
wherever
it
is
to
be
found
being
nearly
black
of
course
they
are
very
conspicuous
against
a
white
background
and
not
at
all
so
when
the
ground
is
bare
possibly
this
may
have
given
rise
to
the
name
well
this
miscalled
bird
is
now
here
and
has
been
for
three
weeks
and
today
is
twittering
gayly
over
wilted
asters
and
so
intent
on
seedhunting
that
i
can
almost
reach
it
with
my
hand
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
an
autumn
rather
than
a
winter
bird
and
is
one
of
several
that
is
loved
because
of
association
rather
than
for
any
marked
trait
of
its
own
i
never
see
them
but
i
recall
my
first
experience
in
trapping
one
december
day
forty
years
ago
it
was
snowing
and
i
murmured
that
i
must
remain
indoors
as
a
recompense
i
was
allowed
to
trap
a
sieve
was
tilted
up
and
rested
upon
a
stick
to
which
was
tied
a
string
reaching
to
the
kitchen
door
a
few
crumbs
were
sprinkled
under
the
sieve
how
i
watched
how
quickly
the
stormy
morning
passed
the
snowbirds
came
and
went
and
at
last
spying
a
crumb
that
had
not
been
covered
a
bird
hopped
beneath
the
sieve
i
pulled
the
string
at
the
right
moment
for
once
there
was
a
happy
mortal
upon
earth
how
impetuously
i
rushed
out
to
the
sieve
and
raising
it
saw
the
frightened
snowbird
fly
away
oh
the
bitterness
of
my
grief
my
bird
had
been
fairly
caught
but
it
would
not
stay
a
captive
and
i
have
had
such
adventures
since
painfully
often
have
i
failed
to
make
good
my
captures
a
deal
of
labor
and
empty
hands
at
last
but
let
us
back
to
our
ornithology
october
th
was
a
perfect
day
there
were
snowbirds
in
the
gardens
and
the
old
maidenblush
apple
tree
was
in
bloom
nutty
october
and
flowery
may
each
a
delight
and
here
commingled
there
should
have
been
music
but
every
bird
was
mute
and
the
hyla
piped
his
one
note
at
longdrawn
intervals
so
undemonstrative
in
every
way
so
silent
save
the
occasional
faint
twitterings
these
birds
of
the
summerlike
afternoon
might
readily
have
been
passed
by
unnoticed
but
it
will
not
be
so
later
they
gather
energy
as
the
mercury
falls
and
when
the
next
hoarfrost
whitens
the
meadows
and
the
uplands
weedy
fields
then
will
they
shake
tall
grass
and
rattle
the
dry
twigs
as
you
approach
they
are
timid
birds
and
your
shadow
or
that
of
a
hawk
creates
a
riot
in
their
ranks
but
they
find
their
wits
as
soon
as
they
lose
them
and
if
you
but
stand
quietly
orderly
seedhunting
is
promptly
resumed
what
then
is
their
peculiar
merit
that
attention
should
be
asked
to
them
i
am
sure
that
i
do
not
know
unless
it
be
that
i
love
them
this
is
merit
enough
in
my
eyes
and
who
that
spent
his
youth
in
the
country
but
recalls
the
birds
of
winter
it
may
be
that
there
was
too
much
work
to
be
done
at
other
times
of
the
year
to
give
heed
to
the
summer
songsters
but
never
in
winter
were
the
days
too
short
to
set
a
rabbit
trap
to
follow
a
covey
of
quails
or
less
murderously
inclined
to
listen
to
the
squirrel
s
bark
or
the
chirping
of
the
sparrows
in
the
hedge
seldom
indeed
are
the
snowbirds
alone
there
are
several
other
species
of
the
same
family
the
finches
here
in
the
same
weedy
pastures
and
far
oftener
all
are
singing
than
that
any
are
silent
autumn
either
early
or
late
is
never
a
dismal
season
as
you
wander
in
the
woods
or
near
them
you
can
not
say
i
walk
as
one
who
treads
alone
some
banquet
hall
deserted
what
summer
took
away
with
her
autumn
has
replaced
there
has
been
a
shifting
of
scenes
but
the
actors
are
as
numerous
as
before
the
round
of
the
seasons
is
a
seriocomic
drama
with
no
heroes
or
with
every
creature
one
as
you
happen
to
view
it
in
midwinter
when
the
deep
snows
come
if
they
come
at
all
how
effectually
the
snowbirds
enliven
what
might
otherwise
be
a
dreary
outlook
on
the
projecting
twigs
above
the
huge
drifts
they
gather
and
plunging
down
deeply
into
the
snow
find
seeds
on
many
a
sturdy
weed
that
winter
winds
have
not
cast
down
their
curious
antics
at
such
a
time
so
vividly
described
by
lockwood
make
us
forget
that
the
day
is
cold
and
whatever
the
weather
i
would
rather
be
among
the
birds
and
see
them
close
at
hand
closer
than
is
ever
possible
from
my
study
windows
perhaps
snow
and
snowbirds
is
too
short
a
list
of
attractions
for
a
winterday
outing
it
is
not
for
me
but
i
have
never
found
it
an
allinclusive
list
there
was
never
a
snow
yet
since
the
days
of
palæolithic
man
at
least
that
covered
the
treetops
and
here
the
chicchicadee
dee
saucy
note
out
of
sound
heart
and
merry
throat
is
very
sure
to
be
heard
even
with
the
mercury
below
zero
it
accords
well
with
the
rippling
twitter
of
the
snowbirds
and
completes
the
day
s
attraction
or
should
do
so
how
tiresome
our
northern
summers
would
be
without
a
bit
of
winter
now
and
then
wherewith
to
contrast
them
it
is
strange
but
true
that
when
the
occasional
rambler
takes
an
outing
he
must
have
a
whole
menagerie
at
his
elbow
or
votes
the
woods
in
winter
a
dismal
solitude
it
is
seldom
that
our
snowbirds
have
only
the
titmouse
for
company
given
a
blackberry
thicket
and
the
whitethroated
sparrows
will
be
there
and
how
gloriously
they
whistle
overstaying
catbirds
here
in
new
jersey
will
be
a
surprise
and
their
midsummer
drawling
will
sound
strangely
coming
over
snowbanks
but
of
late
it
is
a
feature
of
a
winter
walk
winter
in
fact
is
overfull
of
sights
and
sounds
october
to
march
for
five
months
we
have
had
snowbirds
and
none
the
less
a
feature
when
the
asters
empurpled
the
hillsides
than
later
when
the
fields
were
snowbound
what
of
them
too
as
summer
comes
on
apace
even
above
the
wreckage
of
a
wild
winter
snowbirds
can
be
cheerful
never
so
tattered
and
torn
the
rank
growths
of
the
dead
year
but
the
snowbirds
have
reason
to
rejoice
if
not
at
the
present
outlook
then
they
take
a
peep
into
futurity
and
sing
of
what
will
be
probably
our
world
looks
its
dreariest
in
march
as
the
darkest
hour
of
night
is
just
before
the
dawn
but
happily
the
gloom
does
not
weigh
upon
snowbirds
and
to
know
how
cheerfully
they
can
sing
one
must
hear
them
then
their
whole
souls
are
in
their
utterances
and
when
a
hundred
or
more
ring
out
their
gladness
march
sunshine
grows
the
brighter
the
winds
are
tempered
and
many
a
yellow
leaf
becomes
a
golden
blossom
blue
jays
what
is
the
most
characteristic
feature
of
november
asked
a
shivering
friend
from
town
as
we
stood
with
our
backs
to
the
rainladen
winds
birds
and
blossoms
i
replied
of
course
he
thought
me
trifling
with
him
and
i
asked
if
he
expected
me
to
say
rheumatism
what
have
birds
and
blossoms
to
do
with
such
a
dreary
outlook
this
was
evidently
the
tenor
of
my
friend
s
thought
although
he
said
nothing
more
to
him
as
it
was
raining
hard
the
world
was
unutterably
dreary
and
he
longed
for
the
crackling
blaze
upon
the
andirons
which
he
knew
awaited
us
in
a
few
moments
as
we
skirted
a
bit
of
woodland
i
remarked
blue
jays
are
a
feature
of
this
month
see
here
are
half
a
dozen
they
were
very
tame
and
full
of
merry
ways
they
hunted
the
leafstrewed
ground
and
played
bopeep
among
the
lower
branches
of
the
oaks
they
screamed
laughed
chattered
and
at
times
uttered
that
peculiar
flutelike
note
which
sounds
so
strangely
in
the
woods
particularly
when
the
silence
of
midwinter
broods
over
all
my
friend
forgot
that
it
was
a
dull
november
day
these
dandies
in
their
cerulean
suits
can
do
no
mischief
now
and
i
love
them
for
their
vivacity
their
cunning
shows
out
continually
and
it
needs
not
the
dictum
of
the
naturalist
to
learn
that
they
are
cousins
of
the
crow
that
they
lived
so
largely
upon
eggs
during
may
and
june
told
against
them
at
the
time
and
they
were
then
the
incarnation
of
fiendishness
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
one
can
not
be
happy
who
is
ever
cherishing
dislikes
and
i
find
the
blue
jay
of
the
present
sufficient
unto
november
days
for
my
part
he
is
right
welcome
to
the
woods
as
he
finds
them
while
the
six
merry
jays
were
before
us
i
picked
a
violet
a
bluet
and
a
daisy
and
offered
them
as
proof
that
november
blossoms
were
not
a
myth
there
are
i
assured
my
friend
more
than
a
score
of
flowers
to
be
found
by
a
little
careful
searching
what
then
if
summer
s
glory
has
departed
if
her
skies
are
no
longer
overhead
her
songs
no
longer
fill
the
air
the
odor
of
her
blossoms
no
longer
scent
the
breeze
is
it
not
a
poor
wheel
that
can
not
spare
one
spoke
nature
is
not
so
niggardly
with
her
gifts
in
november
as
summer
tourists
for
instance
are
apt
to
suppose
november
is
comparatively
bare
it
is
true
and
positively
ragged
but
it
is
not
always
safe
to
judge
a
man
by
his
coat
a
jay
is
something
more
than
a
bird
with
blue
feathers
october
it
snowed
violently
for
three
hours
and
the
ground
was
white
masses
of
snow
too
clung
to
the
limp
foliage
that
remained
and
gave
a
curious
aspect
to
the
wooded
hillsides
it
was
then
that
the
jays
were
moved
to
unwonted
activity
and
i
saw
them
at
their
best
the
snow
puzzled
them
and
being
intent
upon
their
own
affairs
they
paid
no
heed
to
my
proximity
what
does
this
mean
was
the
question
i
fancied
each
asked
of
his
comrade
and
then
a
dozen
would
attempt
explanation
at
the
same
time
such
a
chattering
although
the
air
was
thick
with
snow
it
did
not
muffle
the
harsh
sounds
noises
as
distracting
as
cracked
sleighbells
a
great
company
of
these
birds
had
been
for
a
week
in
the
hillside
woods
sociably
inclined
but
not
intimately
associated
the
snow
brought
them
together
and
after
an
hour
of
vain
discussion
as
a
compact
flock
they
left
the
woods
and
flew
in
a
direct
line
for
a
cluster
of
cedars
half
a
mile
away
it
appeared
to
me
that
some
one
of
these
birds
made
the
suggestion
that
the
cedars
were
a
better
protection
than
halfleaved
oak
woods
and
all
took
up
with
it
at
any
rate
that
is
where
the
birds
went
and
remained
until
the
snowsquall
was
over
of
course
it
might
have
been
a
mere
coincidence
and
all
their
chattering
mere
meaningless
noise
and
so
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
but
i
am
not
disposed
to
view
birdlife
from
such
a
stupid
standpoint
it
may
suit
the
feathersplitters
as
burroughs
aptly
calls
them
to
look
upon
birds
as
mere
conveniences
for
their
nomenclatorial
skill
but
he
is
happy
who
escapes
them
and
seeks
directly
of
each
bird
he
sees
to
know
what
thoughts
well
up
from
its
little
but
lively
brain
now
i
have
never
seen
but
upon
this
occasion
a
large
number
of
blue
jays
a
dozen
or
more
fly
in
a
compact
flock
here
on
the
home
hillside
and
i
know
nothing
of
them
elsewhere
they
wander
about
during
the
autumn
in
companies
but
always
in
an
independent
manner
as
if
a
very
general
knowledge
of
the
company
s
whereabouts
was
quite
sufficient
but
today
such
a
method
would
have
been
impracticable
the
air
was
too
thick
with
snow
and
therefore
predetermining
the
direction
they
gathered
upon
the
same
tree
and
then
when
closer
together
than
ever
i
saw
redwinged
blackbirds
off
they
flew
to
say
that
this
simple
occurrence
does
not
prove
beyond
question
a
wide
range
of
mental
faculties
is
to
deny
that
two
and
two
make
four
probably
the
unhappy
growler
who
descants
upon
the
allessential
importance
of
the
element
of
accuracy
which
no
one
denies
will
find
this
incident
contrary
to
the
officially
recorded
conditions
of
jay
life
and
insist
that
i
saw
redwinged
blackbirds
and
mistook
them
an
ornithologist
once
wrote
to
me
some
of
your
birds
in
new
jersey
have
strange
ways
but
this
is
not
true
in
the
sense
he
intended
birds
about
home
are
simply
here
as
elsewhere
wideawake
cunning
quick
to
scent
danger
and
wise
enough
to
suit
themselves
to
their
surroundings
this
latter
fact
goes
far
to
explain
many
a
point
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
is
the
country
that
decides
the
bird
s
habits
and
not
that
the
latter
are
a
stereotyped
feature
of
the
country
the
same
people
may
dwell
among
the
hills
and
upon
the
seacoast
but
how
different
are
the
mountaineer
and
the
longshore
man
concerning
birds
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
so
many
people
even
naturalists
are
too
little
concerned
with
birds
ways
and
rest
content
with
a
mere
knowledge
of
their
names
i
once
attended
with
a
prominent
naturalist
an
ornithological
meeting
there
were
a
score
of
birdmen
present
and
very
soon
they
fell
to
eggmeasuring
my
companion
fell
asleep
but
what
of
the
flock
of
blue
jays
they
had
not
long
to
wait
for
clearing
weather
soon
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
and
nature
for
a
brief
hour
wore
a
strange
garb
many
a
tree
was
yet
green
many
were
brilliant
with
gold
and
crimson
and
all
were
flecked
with
masses
of
glistening
snow
it
was
a
splendid
spectacle
a
swiftly
fading
pageant
that
like
a
glowing
sunset
is
remembered
long
after
it
has
passed
away
and
how
the
lively
blue
jays
rejoiced
at
the
return
of
the
sunshine
now
for
the
oak
woods
again
i
could
hear
them
scream
even
though
so
far
away
and
sure
enough
one
after
the
other
came
trooping
back
to
the
same
trees
whereon
they
had
sported
when
the
snow
commenced
how
different
now
was
their
every
movement
from
the
time
that
they
counseled
together
and
took
refuge
in
the
cedar
now
again
they
are
the
blue
jays
that
every
country
lad
well
knows
when
i
saw
them
but
a
short
time
ago
they
were
almost
as
strangers
to
me
it
is
something
to
have
an
outing
during
an
october
snowstorm
when
the
next
comes
let
me
have
blue
jays
again
for
company
it
was
two
weeks
later
when
i
next
saw
the
same
birds
and
under
widely
different
circumstances
november
had
accomplished
much
in
the
way
of
marring
the
fair
face
of
nature
scarcely
a
leaf
was
left
upon
any
tree
except
the
oaks
and
the
damp
mist
that
veils
the
meadows
during
november
was
never
denser
gloomier
and
more
forbidding
than
on
the
th
of
the
month
long
before
sunrise
i
was
out
of
doors
and
not
a
bird
greeted
me
until
i
came
to
the
creekbank
when
out
from
gloomy
depths
came
the
shrill
scream
that
of
itself
is
hideous
but
at
such
a
time
almost
musical
i
tried
in
vain
to
locate
the
sound
but
could
not
while
the
fog
lasted
but
this
mattered
little
all
other
birds
seemed
depressed
and
moody
not
a
sparrow
chirped
until
the
sun
made
the
world
a
little
more
distinct
not
even
a
robin
if
there
were
any
about
cared
to
salute
such
a
sunrise
it
was
something
then
to
have
one
brave
heart
making
merry
and
i
shall
long
thank
the
jays
for
cheering
a
lonely
traveler
an
hour
later
the
birds
thought
better
of
the
day
and
every
hedgerow
rang
with
merry
music
but
the
pleasure
of
the
earliest
sounds
i
had
heard
was
not
forgotten
when
their
continuing
screams
marred
the
melody
of
redbirds
and
foxy
finches
but
why
were
they
so
persistently
noisy
and
so
confined
to
one
spot
my
curiosity
was
aroused
and
i
threaded
a
tangled
brake
to
my
sorrow
in
a
cluster
of
sassafras
sprouts
were
several
jays
and
all
intent
upon
an
object
upon
the
ground
i
hurried
on
held
back
by
green
briers
that
were
really
my
friends
and
finally
reached
the
spot
by
mere
accident
i
escaped
a
serious
encounter
with
our
most
treacherous
if
not
dangerous
mammal
a
skunk
had
caught
a
blue
jay
and
scattered
its
feathers
far
and
near
the
victim
s
companions
were
bemoaning
its
fate
or
berating
the
murderer
i
know
not
which
nor
did
i
pause
to
determine
i
assumed
the
former
as
more
creditable
to
them
and
so
score
another
point
in
favor
of
these
maligned
birds
what
though
there
are
violets
still
in
the
meadows
nature
is
rugged
now
and
among
the
gnarly
branches
of
the
oaks
better
the
shrill
cry
of
the
jay
as
the
north
wind
sweeps
by
than
the
soothing
melody
of
summer
s
tuneful
thrushes
november
needs
all
the
help
that
she
can
get
to
escape
our
malediction
and
the
cry
of
the
blue
jay
prompts
me
at
least
to
be
charitable
the
growth
of
trees
in
the
spring
of
a
considerable
number
of
white
pines
were
planted
about
my
residence
of
these
fifteen
are
still
standing
and
are
apparently
in
full
vigor
my
uncle
who
planted
these
pines
states
that
they
were
of
very
uniform
size
their
trunks
measuring
about
two
and
a
half
inches
in
diameter
at
present
the
smallest
of
the
series
measures
fortythree
inches
in
circumference
four
feet
from
the
ground
and
the
largest
seventynine
inches
nine
of
them
vary
from
sixtytwo
to
sixtyeight
inches
the
average
circumference
of
the
fifteen
trees
is
sixtytwo
and
a
half
inches
these
trees
were
not
placed
at
uniform
distances
from
each
other
and
some
show
the
certain
illeffect
of
overcrowding
this
is
conspicuously
the
case
with
three
of
the
pines
and
these
have
suffered
had
the
planting
been
done
with
greater
reference
to
the
future
and
an
equal
chance
given
each
tree
the
average
circumference
would
have
been
greater
by
at
least
three
inches
the
girth
of
the
twelve
largest
being
sixtyfive
inches
as
it
is
including
the
three
somewhat
stunted
trees
the
growth
circumferential
measurement
has
been
sixty
inches
in
fiftyfour
years
an
annual
increase
of
one
and
one
ninth
inches
these
pines
stand
upon
a
bluff
composed
of
compact
ferruginous
sand
of
great
depth
and
are
exposed
to
the
full
sweep
of
the
western
and
northern
winds
in
the
matter
of
soil
and
exposure
they
have
had
equal
chances
it
is
not
readily
seen
if
at
all
determinable
why
more
of
these
trees
should
not
have
reached
the
maximum
size
and
become
stately
trees
which
in
a
sadly
deforested
landscape
are
commanding
objects
a
year
later
two
wild
cherries
were
planted
near
the
pines
by
the
same
person
these
trees
were
very
small
he
writes
me
as
i
pulled
them
up
with
my
hand
and
carried
them
to
the
yard
as
one
would
a
walkingstick
probably
neither
was
more
than
an
inch
in
diameter
these
trees
are
in
full
vigor
today
one
measuring
seventythree
inches
and
the
other
sixtyeight
in
circumference
the
former
is
fully
fifty
feet
in
height
and
the
crop
of
fruit
it
bears
annually
is
enormous
in
my
grandfather
found
among
a
lot
of
peachtrees
that
he
had
purchased
an
elm
ulmus
americana
which
was
a
mere
switch
it
was
planted
in
an
outoftheway
corner
and
is
now
a
splendid
tree
with
a
spread
of
branches
measuring
seventy
feet
the
circumferential
measurement
at
a
height
of
four
feet
from
the
ground
is
one
hundred
and
three
inches
of
the
oaks
cedar
and
beech
of
which
i
have
many
fine
specimens
upon
the
farm
i
have
not
been
able
to
gather
any
definite
data
but
it
would
appear
that
the
growth
is
exceedingly
slow
after
a
certain
term
of
years
my
uncle
is
very
positive
that
a
black
oak
in
the
lane
and
a
red
cedar
near
by
have
not
increased
materially
in
growth
in
the
past
halfcentury
he
believes
the
cedar
to
have
quite
stood
still
and
this
may
not
be
so
strange
for
it
is
known
to
be
considerably
over
one
hundred
years
old
it
was
a
conspicuous
roadside
tree
in
it
measures
but
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
footnote
since
the
above
was
written
one
of
these
pines
has
been
felled
and
the
rings
of
annual
growth
carefully
counted
they
are
sixty
in
number
which
accords
with
the
history
given
above
of
the
planting
now
nearly
fiftyfive
years
ago
it
may
be
well
to
add
that
while
each
ring
is
distinctly
defined
there
are
several
much
larger
than
the
others
and
a
general
increase
of
the
width
of
the
rings
upon
the
southeastern
side
of
the
trunk
fossil
man
in
the
delaware
valley
the
modest
peaceful
valley
of
the
delaware
river
from
the
head
of
tidewater
southward
is
as
little
suggestive
of
the
arctic
circle
for
at
least
nine
months
of
the
year
as
do
its
low
and
weedy
banks
in
summer
suggest
the
tropics
on
the
contrary
every
tree
shrub
sedge
beast
bird
or
fish
that
you
see
above
about
or
within
it
is
a
feature
of
a
strictly
temperate
climate
nevertheless
a
dim
recollection
of
more
stirring
times
still
clings
to
it
and
the
year
not
unfrequently
opens
with
the
river
firmly
icebound
over
its
shallows
are
often
piled
great
masses
of
upriver
ice
borne
hither
after
a
storm
by
the
swollen
current
often
the
broad
and
shallow
channel
is
effectually
closed
and
the
river
becomes
for
the
time
being
a
frozen
lake
but
the
ice
of
late
centuries
has
not
been
able
to
hold
its
own
for
any
significant
length
of
time
the
increasing
warmth
of
the
sun
and
the
south
winds
with
their
accompanying
rains
soon
start
the
little
icebergs
oceanward
or
melt
them
when
they
are
securely
stranded
except
a
few
scattered
masses
along
the
shady
shores
the
river
by
april
is
a
quiet
shallow
tidewater
stream
again
no
appreciable
amount
of
detritus
is
now
brought
from
the
upriver
region
by
a
single
winter
s
accumulation
of
ice
as
the
river
and
its
shores
are
today
so
they
were
a
century
ago
perhaps
for
many
centuries
but
the
winter
of
our
varying
year
is
a
mere
puppetshow
compared
with
what
new
jersey
winters
once
were
and
the
culmination
of
arctic
rigors
gave
our
delaware
valley
in
that
distant
day
a
far
different
aspect
and
with
each
succeeding
glacial
flood
more
and
more
sand
gravel
and
great
bowlders
were
rolled
down
from
the
rockribbed
valley
beyond
and
spread
upon
the
open
plain
through
which
the
present
stream
unruffled
flows
the
land
was
somewhat
depressed
then
and
the
water
flowed
at
a
higher
level
but
nothing
unfavorable
to
man
s
existence
obtained
in
the
whole
region
as
a
skilled
geologist
has
pointed
out
the
northern
ice
was
one
hundred
miles
away
and
did
not
prevent
primitive
man
from
assembling
about
the
low
and
hospitable
shores
of
the
miniature
sea
and
over
the
bosom
of
the
bay
little
affected
by
tide
because
of
its
distance
from
the
ocean
and
little
disturbed
by
waves
because
of
its
shoalness
palæolithic
man
may
have
floated
on
the
simplest
craft
or
even
have
waded
in
the
shallow
waters
ay
may
have
but
did
he
what
evidence
is
there
that
that
most
primitive
of
mankind
who
left
such
abundant
traces
of
his
presence
in
the
valley
of
many
a
european
river
and
also
in
asia
and
africa
was
ever
likewise
here
in
eastern
north
america
it
is
precisely
the
same
evidence
rude
stone
implements
of
the
simplest
type
often
but
slightly
modified
cobbles
merely
that
were
found
to
be
more
effective
by
having
a
chipped
and
jagged
edge
rather
than
the
smooth
and
tapering
one
that
waterwearing
produces
these
same
worked
stones
in
other
countries
always
of
flint
but
in
new
jersey
of
argillite
a
slatelike
stone
that
has
been
altered
by
heat
and
possesses
now
a
conchoidal
fracture
these
occur
in
the
delaware
gravels
and
the
vivid
pictures
of
glacial
time
with
primitive
man
a
prominent
feature
thereof
that
have
been
given
by
wright
wilson
haynes
mcgee
upham
cresson
babbitt
and
others
are
doubtless
familiar
to
all
readers
of
recent
scientific
literature
in
associating
man
with
ancient
river
valleys
we
are
too
apt
to
think
only
of
the
stream
and
ignore
the
surrounding
country
though
largely
so
palæolithic
man
was
not
strictly
an
amphibious
creature
for
instance
on
each
side
of
the
ancient
delaware
river
extended
wide
reaches
of
upland
forest
and
here
too
the
rude
hunter
of
the
time
found
game
well
worthy
of
his
ingenuity
to
capture
and
so
powerful
that
all
his
wit
stood
him
well
in
need
to
escape
their
equally
determined
efforts
to
capture
him
while
the
seal
and
walrus
disported
in
the
river
while
fish
in
countless
thousands
stemmed
its
floods
while
geese
and
ducks
in
myriads
rested
upon
the
stream
so
too
in
the
forest
roamed
the
moose
the
elk
the
reindeer
the
bison
the
extinct
great
beaver
and
the
mastodon
all
of
which
save
the
elk
had
long
since
left
for
more
northern
climes
when
european
man
first
sighted
north
america
the
association
of
man
and
the
mastodon
is
somewhat
startling
to
most
people
but
as
has
been
time
and
again
conclusively
shown
it
is
no
unwarranted
fancy
we
are
apt
to
consider
the
mastodon
as
a
creature
of
so
distant
a
time
in
the
unrecorded
past
that
man
must
necessarily
have
appeared
much
later
upon
the
scene
the
truth
is
comparatively
speaking
the
creature
so
recently
became
extinct
that
in
all
probability
our
historic
indians
were
acquainted
with
it
certain
it
is
that
in
the
distant
long
ago
of
the
great
ice
age
the
mastodon
existed
and
equally
certain
that
with
him
lived
that
primitive
man
who
fabricated
the
rude
implements
we
have
described
the
bones
of
the
animal
and
the
bones
and
weapons
of
the
man
lie
side
by
side
deep
down
in
the
gravels
deposited
by
the
floods
from
the
melting
icesheet
in
february
i
walked
to
and
fro
over
the
frozen
delaware
where
it
reaches
a
full
mile
in
width
and
saw
at
the
time
many
horses
and
sleighs
passing
from
shore
to
shore
i
recalled
as
i
walked
what
the
geologists
have
recorded
of
the
river
s
history
and
it
was
no
wild
whim
of
the
unchecked
imagination
to
picture
the
delaware
as
a
still
more
firmly
frozen
stream
so
firmly
icebound
indeed
that
the
mastodon
might
pass
in
safety
over
it
not
cautiously
even
but
with
the
quick
trot
of
the
angry
elephant
and
picture
still
further
a
terrorstricken
stoneage
hunter
fleeing
for
his
life
just
as
our
brief
yearly
winter
gives
way
to
milder
spring
so
as
the
centuries
rolled
by
the
mighty
winter
of
the
ice
age
yielded
to
changes
that
were
slowly
wrought
century
by
century
the
sun
s
power
was
exerted
with
more
telling
effect
constantly
increasing
areas
of
northwardlying
land
were
laid
bare
and
the
forest
followed
the
retreating
glacier
s
steps
this
great
but
gradual
change
had
of
course
its
influence
upon
animal
life
and
many
of
the
large
mammals
that
have
been
named
appear
to
have
preferred
the
cooler
to
the
warmer
climate
and
followed
the
icesheet
on
its
northward
march
in
the
unnumbered
centuries
during
which
these
changes
came
about
man
increased
in
wisdom
if
not
in
stature
and
the
rude
implements
that
characterize
the
lowest
known
form
of
humanity
palæolithic
man
of
prehistoric
archæology
were
gradually
discarded
for
smaller
and
more
specialized
ones
this
change
was
doubtless
the
result
of
faunal
changes
that
required
a
compound
instead
of
a
simple
implement
as
an
effective
weapon
a
small
spearhead
attached
to
a
shaft
instead
of
a
sharpened
stone
held
in
the
hand
and
we
find
now
as
characteristic
of
conditions
geologically
later
than
the
gravelbeds
a
welldesigned
spearpoint
larger
than
indian
arrowheads
of
a
remarkably
uniform
pattern
and
which
might
readily
be
supposed
to
be
the
handiwork
of
the
historic
indians
but
let
us
examine
into
the
history
of
these
objects
a
little
closely
in
the
first
place
the
conditions
under
which
these
rude
spearpoints
are
found
as
a
rule
are
very
significant
in
certain
upland
fields
never
far
from
watercourses
and
which
were
the
high
dry
habitable
localities
when
the
later
gravel
areas
were
yet
comparatively
low
and
swampy
these
objects
are
found
in
great
abundance
and
very
often
not
associated
with
the
familiar
forms
of
indian
implements
again
they
also
occur
in
the
alluvial
mud
which
has
been
for
centuries
and
is
still
accumulating
over
the
tidewater
meadows
that
skirt
the
banks
of
the
delaware
river
from
trenton
to
the
sea
now
it
may
be
maintained
that
we
are
without
warrant
in
assuming
that
the
age
or
object
of
any
given
form
of
stone
implement
can
be
determined
by
the
character
of
the
locality
where
it
happens
usually
to
be
found
exception
of
course
being
made
to
the
palæolithic
implements
of
an
earlier
geological
period
to
a
certain
extent
this
is
true
a
bead
is
none
the
less
an
ornament
whether
dredged
from
the
riverbottom
or
found
in
an
upland
field
and
yet
how
very
seldom
does
any
implement
or
other
relic
of
the
indians
occur
except
where
we
should
expect
to
find
it
in
basing
any
conclusions
upon
the
characteristic
features
of
a
locality
where
implements
are
found
it
is
necessary
to
determine
if
there
has
been
any
recent
general
disturbance
of
the
spot
this
is
readily
done
usually
and
the
principal
barrier
to
a
logical
conclusion
is
removed
long
experience
in
archæological
fieldwork
has
fully
convinced
me
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
stone
implements
are
practically
in
the
same
position
that
they
were
when
buried
lost
or
discarded
a
single
specimen
or
many
of
them
might
mislead
but
it
becomes
safe
to
base
a
conclusion
upon
the
locality
when
we
have
the
material
in
such
abundance
as
in
this
instance
of
these
rude
spearpoints
and
find
that
fully
eighty
per
cent
are
from
the
alluvial
mud
of
the
river
meadows
or
such
isolated
upland
areas
as
have
been
described
but
more
significant
than
all
else
is
the
fact
that
these
simply
designed
spearpoints
are
all
of
argillite
the
same
material
of
which
are
made
the
rude
implements
found
in
the
gravel
there
is
therefore
no
break
as
it
were
in
the
sequence
of
events
in
the
occupation
of
the
region
by
man
no
change
of
race
no
evidence
of
an
abrupt
transition
from
one
method
of
toolmaking
to
that
of
another
but
merely
an
improvement
that
was
doubtless
as
gradual
as
the
change
from
the
epoch
of
glacial
cold
to
that
of
our
moderate
climate
of
today
what
at
first
sight
appears
fatal
to
the
views
here
expressed
is
that
a
people
so
far
advanced
as
to
make
these
spearpoints
should
have
made
many
other
forms
of
stone
implements
but
only
the
former
are
found
deeply
buried
in
the
mud
of
the
river
if
as
is
believed
the
spears
were
used
in
fishing
more
than
for
any
other
purpose
they
alone
would
be
likely
to
be
lost
other
objects
in
use
upon
their
village
sites
would
seldom
if
ever
be
taken
to
the
fishinggrounds
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
found
numbers
of
stone
objects
of
a
rude
character
usually
considered
of
indian
origin
but
which
are
identical
with
those
used
for
instance
by
the
boreal
chukches
in
nordenskiöld
s
voyage
of
the
vega
is
described
a
series
of
stone
hammers
and
a
stone
anvil
which
are
in
use
today
for
crushing
bones
every
considerable
collection
of
indian
relics
gathered
along
our
seaboard
from
maine
to
maryland
contains
examples
of
identical
objects
of
course
the
indians
might
have
used
indeed
did
use
such
hammers
and
anvils
but
considering
all
the
evidence
and
not
merely
a
part
of
it
it
does
not
follow
that
all
hammers
and
anvils
are
of
indian
origin
i
have
only
made
incidental
mention
of
the
historic
indian
and
nothing
further
is
necessary
he
plays
an
important
part
in
our
early
history
but
his
origin
is
yet
to
be
deciphered
from
many
sources
his
arrival
in
the
river
s
valley
dates
as
we
reckon
years
long
long
ago
but
no
evidence
is
as
yet
forthcoming
that
it
was
prior
to
the
valley
s
practically
present
physical
aspect
let
us
consider
these
rude
argillite
spearpoints
and
the
circumstances
under
which
they
occur
a
little
more
closely
in
this
magazine
january
i
based
the
opinion
that
these
objects
were
of
an
earlier
and
other
than
indian
origin
because
of
their
occurrence
in
so
many
localities
at
a
depth
greater
than
that
at
which
jasper
and
quartz
arrowheads
are
found
in
other
words
the
plow
unearths
the
indian
relics
in
great
quantities
but
my
digging
deeper
objects
of
argillite
are
found
in
significant
numbers
in
this
earlier
communication
to
the
magazine
reference
was
made
only
to
scattered
objects
but
now
i
propose
to
call
attention
to
strictly
surfacefound
specimens
where
they
have
been
discovered
in
such
abundance
as
to
plainly
indicate
the
former
sites
of
camps
or
villages
if
such
localities
are
really
preindian
in
origin
then
it
remains
but
to
consider
the
fate
of
this
earlier
people
but
before
indulging
in
speculation
what
of
the
facts
the
results
of
my
labors
may
be
summed
up
in
a
brief
account
of
a
visit
to
one
locality
for
all
subsequent
and
preceding
visits
to
distant
points
resulted
similarly
in
two
instances
collections
which
i
studied
were
of
such
magnitude
and
had
been
brought
together
with
such
care
that
they
had
a
decided
bearing
upon
the
question
the
particular
fields
from
which
the
great
bulk
of
the
specimens
had
been
taken
were
studied
most
carefully
and
it
soon
became
evident
in
each
case
that
the
reported
commingling
of
all
forms
of
stone
implements
was
more
apparent
than
real
the
physical
geography
of
each
locality
plainly
showed
that
for
a
very
protracted
period
these
spots
had
been
habitable
and
inhabited
it
was
evident
in
each
case
that
a
very
undulating
surface
had
existed
through
which
meandered
a
small
stream
that
had
long
since
disappeared
these
areas
of
hillock
and
dale
had
been
densely
wooded
with
here
and
there
a
little
clearing
and
now
for
nearly
two
centuries
plowed
over
almost
every
year
what
then
should
we
expect
presuming
that
the
relics
of
two
peoples
had
been
left
upon
a
tract
of
some
two
hundred
acres
first
the
tract
was
deforested
which
would
lead
to
much
disturbance
of
the
surface
soil
secondly
the
stumps
of
the
trees
were
uprooted
which
would
lead
to
a
greater
disturbance
and
lastly
constant
plowing
exposure
of
a
raw
surface
to
winds
and
rain
and
the
erosion
due
to
the
flooding
of
the
stream
that
drained
the
tract
would
result
inevitably
in
the
moving
of
objects
as
small
as
arrowpoints
to
considerable
distances
from
where
they
were
left
in
indian
or
preindian
times
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
any
evidence
of
earlier
and
later
occupancy
had
withstood
such
vicissitudes
and
yet
such
was
the
case
the
highest
ground
afforded
ninety
per
cent
of
the
specimens
i
was
able
to
find
of
argillite
while
in
the
lowlying
area
of
the
onetime
stream
s
tortuous
bed
the
argillite
and
jasper
implements
were
commingled
with
a
preponderance
of
jasper
and
quartz
in
the
ratio
of
seven
to
two
it
was
evident
that
the
washing
down
of
the
higher
ground
and
partial
obliteration
of
the
valley
had
transported
the
argillite
and
mingled
it
with
the
jasper
and
not
generally
commingled
and
brought
to
certain
points
the
equally
scattered
objects
made
of
these
minerals
during
the
summer
of
a
very
careful
and
intelligent
observer
reported
to
me
that
in
a
field
not
far
from
where
i
live
he
had
found
a
considerable
deposit
of
argillite
chips
rude
arrowheads
and
bits
of
pottery
but
that
there
was
no
trace
of
jasper
or
quartz
or
indeed
of
any
other
mineral
as
i
had
collected
indian
relics
by
the
hundreds
in
this
same
field
i
refrained
from
visiting
the
spot
but
requested
my
friend
to
examine
the
locality
again
with
great
care
and
report
to
prof
putnam
of
the
peabody
museum
at
cambridge
massachusetts
what
was
the
result
my
friend
reported
briefly
that
the
spot
was
one
uncovered
by
heavy
rains
and
formed
part
of
the
bank
of
a
brook
that
crossed
the
field
this
brook
i
would
state
was
a
considerable
creek
in
that
the
argillite
chips
rude
arrowpoints
knives
scrapers
and
bits
of
pottery
were
found
at
a
common
level
and
about
fifteen
inches
below
the
present
surface
of
the
field
prof
putnam
in
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
the
specimens
and
report
as
to
their
discovery
replied
that
the
pottery
was
of
unusual
interest
as
it
was
exceedingly
rude
and
differed
very
greatly
from
any
that
dr
abbott
had
sent
from
the
same
general
neighborhood
as
the
bits
of
pottery
from
this
general
neighborhood
that
i
have
collected
amount
to
hundreds
of
thousands
it
would
seem
that
prof
putnam
s
remarks
have
a
good
deal
of
significance
as
having
a
most
important
bearing
upon
this
general
question
it
is
well
to
refer
to
the
results
of
others
labors
in
the
same
general
field
in
an
address
before
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
at
its
cleveland
ohio
meeting
august
i
referred
to
the
lockwood
collection
now
at
the
peabody
museum
at
cambridge
mass
this
series
of
ancient
stone
implements
is
one
of
exceeding
value
because
the
objects
are
nearly
all
from
shellheaps
on
the
coast
of
new
jersey
when
arranging
this
collection
i
was
much
impressed
with
the
fact
that
the
argillite
implements
of
which
there
were
many
considerable
lots
were
all
labeled
by
prof
lockwood
as
having
been
found
alone
i
e
not
associated
with
similar
objects
of
jasper
or
quartz
and
again
that
with
the
argillite
was
much
very
rude
pottery
that
bore
little
resemblance
to
the
fragments
of
earthenware
found
in
other
places
associated
with
the
jasper
quartz
and
chert
implements
subsequently
prof
lockwood
informed
me
that
while
these
various
finds
did
not
vary
in
depth
they
were
very
marked
otherwise
and
he
did
not
recall
any
special
find
where
the
commingling
of
the
two
forms
indicated
that
they
had
been
in
use
at
the
same
time
taking
a
hint
from
little
brooks
and
the
surrounding
fields
let
us
consider
in
conclusion
the
more
pretentious
rivers
and
their
surrounding
uplands
will
the
same
results
be
obtained
can
we
venture
to
reach
out
from
the
particular
to
the
general
these
were
the
questions
that
i
frequently
asked
myself
and
after
many
a
weary
tramp
and
toilsome
digging
over
a
wide
area
i
am
happy
to
state
that
i
believe
my
efforts
have
been
crowned
with
a
full
measure
of
success
what
held
good
in
a
particular
field
holds
good
of
a
county
and
what
i
now
claim
for
the
tidewater
portion
of
the
valley
of
the
delaware
i
believe
is
true
of
a
much
more
extended
area
in
no
case
have
i
been
able
to
find
stone
implements
significantly
distributed
over
a
considerable
space
i
e
tracts
of
five
hundred
to
a
thousand
acres
except
where
there
was
or
very
recently
had
been
running
water
the
ground
then
to
be
examined
was
either
the
high
land
that
shut
in
the
valley
or
the
valley
itself
limiting
that
term
to
the
banks
of
the
stream
and
the
immediately
adjacent
meadow
tracts
exception
being
made
where
the
bank
of
the
stream
was
and
always
had
been
very
precipitous
in
such
a
case
the
brow
of
the
bluff
would
be
equivalent
to
the
meadow
or
low
land
of
a
gently
sloping
valley
in
every
such
instance
and
i
have
made
or
have
had
made
many
careful
examinations
of
river
and
creek
valleys
the
result
was
the
same
a
very
marked
preponderance
of
argillite
implements
on
the
crests
of
the
uplands
and
a
very
great
excess
of
jasper
and
quartz
on
the
bottomland
or
that
directly
adjacent
to
the
stream
from
this
condition
i
am
led
to
infer
that
when
these
higher
points
were
occupied
the
present
streams
maintained
a
uniform
flow
as
high
as
the
freshet
stage
of
these
watercourses
and
the
fact
that
an
indian
village
site
near
by
will
be
much
nearer
the
river
or
creek
shows
clearly
i
hold
that
on
a
small
scale
the
same
conditions
were
repeated
that
occurred
in
the
gradual
change
from
glacial
to
postglacial
times
the
volume
of
water
in
all
our
streams
comparing
century
with
century
is
gradually
lessening
comparing
then
the
rude
objects
of
argillite
specialized
as
they
are
with
the
magnificent
flintwork
of
the
historic
indians
i
would
designate
the
former
as
fossil
implements
the
latter
as
relics
to
this
point
i
feel
that
i
have
been
handling
facts
only
and
deducing
from
them
only
logical
inferences
but
now
looms
up
the
natural
and
everinteresting
question
who
were
these
people
the
origin
of
any
race
is
a
difficult
problem
to
solve
but
none
can
compare
with
these
misty
vestiges
of
prehistoric
humanity
it
seems
to
me
but
one
inference
is
permissible
they
who
fashioned
these
rude
argillite
implements
were
the
descendants
of
palæolithic
man
and
his
superior
in
so
far
as
a
knowledge
of
the
bow
and
arrow
and
rude
pottery
indicates
beyond
this
perhaps
we
can
not
safely
venture
prof
haynes
has
recently
observed
the
palæolithic
man
of
the
river
gravels
at
trenton
and
his
argilliteusing
posterity
the
writer
believes
to
be
completely
extinct
while
this
at
present
seems
to
be
the
generally
accepted
conclusion
there
is
a
phase
of
the
subject
that
merits
consideration
may
not
this
argilliteusing
man
have
been
a
bloodrelation
of
existing
eskimos
to
accept
the
view
of
prof
haynes
that
argillite
man
became
extinct
infers
an
interval
of
indefinite
length
when
man
did
not
exist
on
our
central
atlantic
seaboard
but
if
we
may
judge
from
the
abundant
traces
of
man
that
have
been
left
and
of
the
relation
as
to
position
that
these
three
general
forms
palæolithic
later
argillite
and
indian
bear
to
each
other
it
would
appear
that
in
the
valley
of
the
delaware
at
least
man
has
not
for
a
day
ceased
to
occupy
the
land
since
the
first
of
his
kind
stood
upon
the
shores
of
that
beautiful
river
by
referring
these
intermediate
people
to
the
existing
eskimos
i
would
not
be
understood
as
maintaining
that
these
boreal
people
were
directly
descended
from
the
argilliteusing
folk
of
the
delaware
valley
but
that
both
were
derived
from
palæolithic
man
in
other
words
that
with
the
disappearance
of
glacial
conditions
in
the
delaware
valley
and
the
retirement
northward
of
the
continental
icesheet
if
such
there
were
the
people
of
that
distant
day
followed
in
its
tracks
and
lived
the
same
life
their
ancestors
had
lived
when
northern
new
jersey
was
as
bleak
as
is
greenland
today
but
that
not
all
of
this
strange
people
were
so
enamored
of
an
arctic
life
and
that
many
remained
and
with
the
gradual
amelioration
of
the
climate
their
descendants
changed
in
their
habits
so
far
as
to
meet
the
requirements
of
a
temperate
climate
this
explanation
it
seems
to
me
best
accords
with
known
facts
it
is
fitting
after
a
long
tramp
in
search
of
human
relics
or
remains
still
so
abundantly
scattered
over
and
through
the
superficial
soil
to
halt
at
the
day
s
close
upon
the
river
s
bank
and
rest
upon
one
of
the
huge
icetransported
bowlders
that
reach
above
the
sod
from
such
a
point
i
can
mark
the
boundary
of
the
latest
phenomenon
of
the
valley
s
geological
history
and
seem
to
see
what
time
the
walrus
and
the
seal
sported
in
the
river
s
icy
waters
what
time
the
mastodon
the
reindeer
and
the
bison
tenanted
the
pine
forests
that
clad
the
river
s
banks
and
what
time
an
almost
primitive
man
stealing
through
the
primeval
forests
surprised
and
captured
these
mighty
beasts
what
time
lingering
by
the
blowholes
of
the
seal
and
walrus
in
the
frozen
river
surprised
and
killed
these
creatures
with
so
simple
a
weapon
as
a
sharply
chipped
fragment
of
flinty
rock
and
as
the
centuries
rolled
by
and
the
river
itself
lessened
in
bulk
until
it
but
little
more
than
filled
its
present
channel
there
still
remained
along
its
shores
the
more
cultured
descendants
of
the
primitive
chipper
of
pebbles
as
a
savage
so
like
the
modern
eskimo
that
he
has
been
held
to
be
the
same
this
preindian
people
still
wrought
the
argillite
that
their
ancestors
were
forced
to
use
for
their
palæolithic
tools
and
as
these
spearpoints
are
being
gathered
from
the
alluvial
deposits
of
the
more
modern
river
i
can
recall
to
their
accustomed
haunts
this
longgone
people
who
ere
they
gave
place
to
the
fierce
algonkin
were
the
peaceful
tenants
of
this
river
s
valley
then
as
we
gather
the
beautiful
arrowheads
of
jasper
and
quartz
and
pick
from
superficial
soils
grooved
axes
celts
chisels
curiously
wrought
pipes
strange
ornaments
ceremonial
objects
and
fragments
of
pottery
literally
without
number
we
marvel
at
the
skill
of
those
who
wrought
them
and
faintly
realize
how
long
these
comparatively
recent
comers
must
have
dwelt
in
this
same
valley
to
have
accumulated
such
an
endless
store
of
these
imperishable
relics
we
rightly
speak
of
the
antiquity
of
the
indian
but
remote
as
is
his
arrival
on
the
atlantic
coast
it
is
modern
indeed
in
comparison
with
the
antiquity
of
man
in
the
same
region
we
can
think
of
it
and
perhaps
faintly
realize
it
as
time
relative
but
in
no
wise
determine
it

preface
almost
every
english
boy
can
be
taught
to
write
clearly
so
far
at
least
as
clearness
depends
upon
the
arrangement
of
words
force
elegance
and
variety
of
style
are
more
difficult
to
teach
and
far
more
difficult
to
learn
but
clear
writing
can
be
reduced
to
rules
to
teach
the
art
of
writing
clearly
is
the
main
object
of
these
rules
and
exercises
ambiguity
may
arise
not
only
from
bad
arrangement
but
also
from
other
causesfrom
the
misuse
of
single
words
and
from
confused
thought
these
causes
are
not
removable
by
definite
rules
and
therefore
though
not
neglected
are
not
prominently
considered
in
this
book
my
object
rather
is
to
point
out
some
few
continually
recurring
causes
of
ambiguity
and
to
suggest
definite
remedies
in
each
case
speeches
in
parliament
newspaper
narratives
and
articles
and
above
all
resolutions
at
public
meetings
furnish
abundant
instances
of
obscurity
arising
from
the
monotonous
neglect
of
some
dozen
simple
rules
the
art
of
writing
forcibly
is
of
course
a
valuable
acquisitionalmost
as
valuable
as
the
art
of
writing
clearly
but
forcible
expression
is
not
like
clear
expression
a
mere
question
of
mechanism
and
of
the
manipulation
of
words
it
is
a
much
higher
power
and
implies
much
more
writing
clearly
does
not
imply
thinking
clearly
a
man
may
think
and
reason
as
obscurely
as
dogberry
himself
but
he
may
though
it
is
not
probable
that
he
will
be
able
to
write
clearly
for
all
that
writing
clearlyso
far
as
arrangement
of
words
is
concernedis
a
mere
matter
of
adverbs
conjunctions
prepositions
and
auxiliary
verbs
placed
and
repeated
according
to
definite
rules
even
obscure
or
illogical
thought
can
be
clearly
expressed
indeed
the
transparent
medium
of
clear
writing
is
not
least
beneficial
when
it
reveals
the
illogical
nature
of
the
meaning
beneath
it
on
the
other
hand
if
a
man
is
to
write
forcibly
he
must
to
use
a
wellknown
illustration
describe
jerusalem
as
sown
with
salt
not
as
captured
and
the
jews
not
as
being
subdued
but
as
almost
exterminated
by
titus
but
what
does
this
imply
it
implies
knowledge
and
very
often
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
and
it
implies
also
a
vivid
imagination
the
writer
must
have
eyes
to
see
the
vivid
side
of
everything
as
well
as
words
to
describe
what
he
sees
hence
forcible
writing
and
of
course
tasteful
writing
also
is
far
less
a
matter
of
rules
than
is
clear
writing
and
hence
though
forcible
writing
is
exemplified
in
the
exercises
clear
writing
occupies
most
of
the
space
devoted
to
the
rules
boys
who
are
studying
latin
and
greek
stand
in
especial
need
of
help
to
enable
them
to
write
a
long
english
sentence
clearly
the
periods
of
thucydides
and
cicero
are
not
easily
rendered
into
our
idiom
without
some
knowledge
of
the
links
that
connect
an
english
sentence
there
is
scarcely
any
better
training
rhetorical
as
well
as
logical
than
the
task
of
construing
thucydides
into
genuine
english
but
the
flat
vague
longwinded
greekenglish
and
latinenglish
imposture
that
is
often
tolerated
in
our
examinations
and
is
allowed
to
pass
current
for
genuine
english
diminishes
instead
of
increasing
the
power
that
our
pupils
should
possess
over
their
native
language
by
getting
marks
at
school
and
college
for
construing
good
greek
and
latin
into
bad
english
our
pupils
systematically
unlearn
what
they
may
have
been
allowed
to
pick
up
from
milton
and
from
shakespeare
i
must
acknowledge
very
large
obligations
to
professor
bains
treatise
on
english
composition
and
rhetoric
and
also
to
his
english
grammar
i
have
not
always
been
able
to
agree
with
professor
bain
as
to
matters
of
taste
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
express
my
admiration
for
the
systematic
thoroughness
and
suggestiveness
of
his
book
on
composition
in
particular
professor
bains
rule
on
the
use
of
that
and
which
see
rule
deserves
to
be
better
known
the
ambiguity
produced
by
the
confusion
between
these
two
forms
of
the
relative
is
not
a
mere
fiction
of
pedants
it
is
practically
serious
take
for
instance
the
following
sentence
which
appeared
lately
in
one
of
our
ablest
weekly
periodicals
there
are
a
good
many
radical
members
in
the
house
who
cannot
forgive
the
prime
minister
for
being
a
christian
twenty
years
hence
who
is
to
say
whether
the
meaning
is
and
they
ie
all
the
radical
members
in
the
house
or
there
are
a
good
many
radical
members
of
the
house
that
cannot
c
professor
bain
apparently
admitting
no
exceptions
to
his
useful
rule
amends
many
sentences
in
a
manner
that
seems
to
me
intolerably
harsh
therefore
while
laying
due
stress
on
the
utility
of
the
rule
i
have
endeavoured
to
point
out
and
explain
the
exceptions
the
rules
are
stated
as
briefly
as
possible
and
are
intended
not
so
much
for
use
by
themselves
as
for
reference
while
the
pupil
is
working
at
the
exercises
consequently
there
is
no
attempt
to
prove
the
rules
by
accumulations
of
examples
the
few
examples
that
are
given
are
given
not
to
prove
but
to
illustrate
the
rules
the
exercises
are
intended
to
be
written
out
and
revised
as
exercises
usually
are
but
they
may
also
be
used
for
viva
voce
instruction
the
books
being
shut
the
pupils
with
their
written
exercises
before
them
may
be
questioned
as
to
the
reasons
for
the
several
alterations
they
have
made
experienced
teachers
will
not
require
any
explanation
of
the
arrangement
or
rather
nonarrangement
of
the
exercises
they
have
been
purposely
mixed
together
unclassified
to
prevent
the
pupil
from
relying
upon
anything
but
his
own
common
sense
and
industry
to
show
him
what
is
the
fault
in
each
case
and
how
it
is
to
be
amended
besides
references
to
the
rules
notes
are
attached
to
each
sentence
so
that
the
exercises
ought
not
to
present
any
difficulty
to
a
painstaking
boy
of
twelve
or
thirteen
provided
he
has
first
been
fairly
trained
in
english
grammar
the
continuous
extracts
present
rather
more
difficulty
and
are
intended
for
boys
somewhat
older
than
those
for
whom
the
exercises
are
intended
the
attempt
to
modernize
and
clarify
so
to
speak
the
style
of
burnet
clarendon
and
bishop
butler
may
appear
ambitious
and
perhaps
requires
some
explanation
my
object
has
of
course
not
been
to
improve
upon
the
style
of
these
authors
but
to
show
how
their
meaning
might
be
expressed
more
clearly
in
modern
english
the
charm
of
the
style
is
necessarily
lost
but
if
the
loss
is
recognized
both
by
teacher
and
pupil
there
is
nothing
in
my
opinion
to
counterbalance
the
obvious
utility
of
such
exercises
professor
bain
speaks
to
the
same
effect
for
an
english
exercise
the
matter
should
in
some
way
or
other
be
supplied
and
the
pupil
disciplined
in
giving
it
expression
i
know
of
no
better
method
than
to
prescribe
passages
containing
good
matter
but
in
some
respects
imperfectly
worded
to
be
amended
according
to
the
laws
and
the
proprieties
of
style
our
older
writers
might
be
extensively
though
not
exclusively
drawn
upon
for
this
purpose
to
some
of
the
friends
whose
help
has
been
already
acknowledged
in
english
lessons
for
english
people
i
am
indebted
for
further
help
in
revising
these
pages

desire
to
express
especial
obligations
to
the

fellow

college
cambridge

of

school
for
copious

valuable
suggestions
also
to
several
of
my
colleagues
at

among
whom
i
must
mention
in
particular
the
rev
a
r
vardy
fellow
of

college

before
electrotyping
the
fourth
and

edition
i
wish
to
say
one
word
as
to
the
manner
in
which
this
book
has
been
used
by
my
highest
class
as
a
collection
of
rules
for
reference
in
their
construing
lessons
in
construing
from
thucydides
especially
i
have
found
rules
and
a
of
great
use
the
rules
about
metaphor
and
climax
have
also
been
useful
in
correcting
faults
of
taste
in
their
latin
and
greek
compositions
i
have
hopes
that
used
in
this
way
this
little
book
may
be
of
service
to
the
highest
as
well
as
to
the
middle
classes
of
our
schools

want

i
on
the
contrary
do

honeyi
want

both
practically
however
this
meaning
is
so
rare
that
i
dont
want
butter
or
honey
is
regularly
used
for
i
want
neither
butter
nor
honey
but
where
there
is
the
slightest
danger
of
ambiguity
it
is
desirable
to
use
nor
the
same
ambiguity
attends
not
and
i

commonly
used
for
i

neither
thomas

but
it
might
mean
i

bothi
see
only
one
of

thatthe
different
uses
of

ambiguity
eg
i

so
much
surprised
by
this
statement
that
i
am
desirous
of
resigning
that
i
scarcely
know
what
reply
to

it
is
impossible
to
tell
till
one
has
read
past

whether
the
first
that
depends
upon
so
or
statement
write
the
statement
that
i
am
desirous
of
resigning
surprises
me
so
much
that
i
scarcely
know
c
a
be
careful
in
the
use
of
ambiguous
words
eg
certain
certain
is
often
used
for
some
as
in
independently
of
his
earnings
he
has
a
certain
property
where
the
meaning
might
be
unfailing
under
this
head
may
be
mentioned
the
double
use
of
words
such
as
left
in
the
same
form
and
sound
but
different
in
meaning
even
where
there
is
no
obscurity
the
juxtaposition
of
the
same
word
twice
used
in
two
senses
is
inelegant
eg
bain
he
turned
to
the
left
and
left
the
room
i
have
known
the
following
slovenly
sentence
misunderstood
our
object
is
that
with
the
aid
of
practice
we
may
sometime
arrive
at
the
point
where
we
think
eloquence
in
its
most
praiseworthy
form
to
lie
to
lie
has
been
supposed
to
mean
to
deceive
be
careful
how
you
use
he
it
they
these
c
for
which
see
the
ambiguity
arising
from
the
use
of
he
applying
to
different
persons
is
well
known
he
told
his
friend
that
if
he
did
not
feel
better
in
half
an
hour
he
thought
he
had
better
return
see
for
remedy
much
ambiguity
is
also
caused
by
excessive
use
of
such
phrases
as
in
this
way
of
this
sort
c
god
foreseeing
the
disorders
of
human
nature
has
given
us
certain
passions
and
affections
which
arise
from
or
whose
objects
are
these
disorders
of
this
sort
are
fear
resentment
compassion
repeat
the
noun
among
these
passions
and
affections
are
fear
c
two
distinct
uses
of
it
may
be
noted
it
when
referring
to
something
that
precedes
may
be
called
retrospective
but
when
to
something
that
follows
prospective
in
avoid
indiscriminate
charity
it
is
a
crime
it
is
retrospective
in
it
is
a
crime
to
give
indiscriminately
it
is
prospective
the
prospective
it
if
productive
of
ambiguity
can
often
be
omitted
by
using
the
infinitive
as
a
subject
to
give
indiscriminately
is
a
crime
report
a
speech
in
the
first
not
the
third
person
where
necessary
to
avoid
ambiguity
speeches
in
the
third
person
afford
a
particular
though
very
common
case
of
the
general
ambiguity
mentioned
in
instead
of
he
told
his
friend
that
if
he
did
not
feel
better
c
write
he
said
to
his
friend
if
i
or
you
dont
feel
better
c
a
sometimes
where
the
writer
cannot
know
the
exact
words
or
where
the
exact
words
are
unimportant
or
lengthy
and
uninteresting
the
third
person
is
preferable
thus
where
essex
is
asking
sir
robert
cecil
that
francis
bacon
may
be
appointed
attorneygeneral
the
dialogue
is
as
it
almost
always
is
in
lord
macaulays
writings
in
the
first
person
except
where
it
becomes
tedious
and
uninteresting
so
as
to
require
condensation
and
then
it
drops
into
the
third
person
sir
robert
had
nothing
to
say
but
that
he
thought
his
own
abilities
equal
to
the
place
which
he
hoped
to
obtain
and
that
his
fathers
long
services
deserved
such
a
mark
of
gratitude
from
the
queen
b
omission
of
that
in
a
speech
reported
in
the
third
personeven
when
a
speech
is
reported
in
the
third
person
that
need
not
always
be
inserted
before
the
dependent
verb
thus
instead
of
he
said
that
he
took
it
ill
that
his
promises
were
not
believed
we
may
write
he
took
it
ill
he
said
that
c
this
gives
a
little
more
life
and
sometimes
more
clearness
also
when
you
use
a
participle
as
walking
implying
when
while
though
that
make
it
clear
by
the
context
what
is
implied
republics
in
the
first
instance
are
never
desired
for
their
own
sakes
i
do
not
think
they
will
finally
be
desired
at
all
unaccompanied
by
courtly
graces
and
good
breeding
here
there
is
a
little
doubt
whether
the
meaning
is
since
they
are
or
if
they
are
unaccompanied
that
or
whenmen
walking
that
walk
or
when
they
walk
on
ice
sometimes
fall
it
is
better
to
use
men
walking
to
mean
men
when
they
walk
if
the
relative
is
meant
use
men
that
walk
instead
of
the
participle
while
he
was
walking
on
the
road
he
fell
because
he
was
the
ice
when
the
participle
precedes
the
subject
it
generally
implies
a
cause
seeing
this
he
retired
otherwise
it
generally
has
its
proper
participial
meaning
eg
he
retired
keeping
his
face
towards
us
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
write
on
seeingat
the
same
time
or
while
keeping
though
he
was
he
nevertheless
stood
his
ground
since
he
was
struck
with
terror
he
rapidly
retreated
if
he
is
he
will
soon
retreat
when
using
the
relative
pronoun
use
who
and
which
where
the
meaning
is
and
he
it
c
for
he
it
c
in
other
cases
use
that
if
euphony
allows
i
heard
this
from
the
inspector
who
and
he
heard
it
from
the
guard
that
travelled
with
the
train
fetch
me
all
the
books
that
lie
on
the
table
and
also
the
pamphlets
which
and
these
you
will
find
on
the
floor
an
adherence
to
this
rule
would
remove
much
ambiguity
thus
there
was
a
publichouse
next
door
which
was
a
great
nuisance
means
and
this
ie
the
fact
of
its
being
next
door
was
a
great
nuisance
whereas
that
would
have
meant
next
door
was
a
publichouse
that
ie
the
publichouse
was
a
great
nuisance
who
which
c
introduce
a
new
fact
about
the
antecedent
whereas
that
introduces
something
without
which
the
antecedent
is
incomplete
or
undefined
thus
in
the
first
example
above
inspector
is
complete
in
itself
and
who
introduces
a
new
fact
about
him
guard
is
incomplete
and
requires
that
travelled
with
the
train
to
complete
the
meaning
it
is
not
and
cannot
be
maintained
that
this
rule
though
observed
in
elizabethan
english
is
observed
by
our
best
modern
authors
probably
a
general
impression
that
that
cannot
be
used
to
refer
to
persons
has
assisted
who
in
supplanting
that
as
a
relative
but
the
convenience
of
the
rule
is
so
great
that
beginners
in
composition
may
with
advantage
adhere
to
the
rule
the
following
are
some
of
the
cases
where
who
and
which
are
mostly
used
contrary
to
the
rule
instead
of
that
exceptions
a
when
the
antecedent
is
defined
eg
by
a
possessive
case
modern
english
uses
who
instead
of
that
it
is
rare
though
it
would
be
useful
to
say
his
english
friends
that
had
not
seen
him
for
the
english
friends
or
those
of
his
english
friends
that
had
not
seen
him
b
that
sounds
ill
when
separated
from
its
verb
and
from
its
antecedents
and
emphasized
by
isolation
there
are
many
persons
that
though
unscrupulous
are
commonly
goodtempered
and
that
if
not
strongly
incited
by
selfinterest
are
ready
for
the
most
part
to
think
of
the
interest
of
their
neighbours
shakespeare
frequently
uses
who
after
that
when
the
relative
is
repeated
see
shakespearian
grammar
par
c
if
the
antecedent
is
qualified
by
that
the
relative
must
not
be
that
besides
other
considerations
the
repetition
is
disagreeable
addison
ridicules
such
language
as
that
remark
that
i
made
yesterday
is
not
that
that
i
said
that
i
regretted
that
i
had
made
d
that
cannot
be
preceded
by
a
preposition
and
hence
throws
the
preposition
to
the
end
this
is
the
rule
that
i
adhere
to
this
is
perfectly
good
english
though
sometimes
unnecessarily
avoided
but
with
some
prepositions
the
construction
is
harsh
and
objectionable
eg
this
is
the
mark
that
i
jumped
beyond
such
were
the
prejudices
that
he
rose
above
the
reason
is
that
some
of
these
disyllabic
prepositions
are
used
as
adverbs
and
when
separated
from
their
nouns
give
one
the
impression
that
they
are
used
as
adverbs
e
after
pronominal
adjectives
used
for
personal
pronouns
modern
english
prefers
who
there
are
many
others

c
f
after
that
used
as

there
is
sometimes

evident

in

this

a
violation

religious
liberty
and
which
the
memorialists
believe
would
provoke
a
determined

not

the
objection
to
the
participle
is
that
here
as
often
it
creates
a
little
ambiguity
the
above
sentence
may
mean
men
when
they
thirst
or
though
they
thirst
as
well
as
men
that
thirst
often
however
there
is
no

g
omission
of
relativeit
is
sometimes
thought
ungrammatical
to
omit
the
relative
as
in
the
man
that
you
speak
of
on
the
contrary
that
when
an
object
not
when
a
subject
may
be
omitted
wherever
the
antecedent
and
the
subject
of
the
relative
sentence
are
brought
into
juxtaposition
by
the
omission
a
repeat
the
antecedent
in
some
new
form
where
there
is
any
ambiguity
this
is
particularly
useful
after
a
negative
he

not
even

here
the

i

that
he
would
not
hear

write

refusal
or
a

most
important
rule
instead

nor
the
means
of

them
write
if
you
can
with

i

not
a
crust

nor
a
penny

cautionthere
is
a
danger
in
this
use
the
meaning
is
vividly
expressed
but
sometimes
may
be
exaggerated
or
imperfect
crust
of
bread
may
be
an
exaggeration
on
the
other
hand
if
the
speaker
is
destitute
not
only
of
bread
but
also
of
shelter
and
clothing
then
crust
of
bread
is
an
imperfect
expression
of
the
meaning
in
philosophy
and
science
where
the
language
ought
very
often
to
be
inclusive
and
brief
general
and
not
particular
terms
must
be
used
a
avoid
verbal
nouns
where
verbs
can
be
used
instead
the
disadvantage
of
the
use
of
verbal
nouns
is
this
that
unless
they
are
immediately
preceded
by
prepositions
they
are
sometimes
liable
to
be
confounded
with
participles
the
following
is
an
instance
of
an
excessive
use
of
verbal
nouns
the
pretended
confession
of
the
secretary
was
only
collusion
to
lay
the
jealousies
of
the
kings
favouring
popery
which
still
hung
upon
him
notwithstanding
his
writing
on
the
revelation
and
affecting
to
enter
on
all
occasions
into
controversy
asserting
in
particular
that
the
pope
was
antichrist
write
notwithstanding
that
he
wrote
and
affected
c
use
a
particular
person
instead
of
a
class
what
is
the
splendour
of
the
greatest
monarch
compared
with
the
beauty
of
a
flower
what
is
the
splendour
of
solomon
compared
with
the
beauty
of
a
daisy
under
this
head
may
come
the
forcible
use
of
noun
for
adjective
this
fortress
is
weakness
itself
an
excess
of
this
use
is
lengthy
and
pedantically
bombastic
eg
the
following
paraphrase
for
in
every
british
colonyunder
indian
palmgroves
amid
australian
gumtrees
in
the
shadow
of
african
mimosas
and
beneath

pines
use
metaphor
instead
of
literal
statement
the
ship
ploughs
the
sea
is
clearer
than
the
ship
cleaves
the
sea
and
shorter
than
the
ship
cleaves
the
sea
as
a
plough
cleaves
the
land
of
course
there
are
some
subjects
for
which
metaphor
should
not
be
used
see
a
and
b
do
not
confuse
metaphor
in
a
moment
the
thunderbolt
was
upon
them
deluging
their
country
with
invaders
the
following
is
attributed
to
sir
boyle
roche
mr
speaker
i
smell
a
rat
i
see
him
brewing
in
the
air
but
mark
me
i
shall
yet
nip
him
in
the
bud
some
words
once
metaphorical
have
ceased
to
be
so
regarded
hence
many
good
writers
say
under
these
circumstances
instead
of
in
these
circumstances
an
excessive
regard
for
disused
metaphor
savours
of
pedantry
disregard
is
inelegant
write
not
unparalleled
complications
but
unprecedented
complications
and
he
threw
light
on
obscurities
instead
of
he
unravelled
obscurities
a
do
not
introduce
literal
statement
immediately
after
metaphor
he
was
the
father
of
chemistry
and
brother
to
the
earl
of
cork
he
was
a
very
thunderbolt
of
war
and
was
lieutenant
to
the
earl
of
mar
b
do
not
use
poetic
metaphor
to
illustrate
a
prosaic
subject
thus
we
may
say
a
poet
soars
or
even
though
rarely
a
nation
soars
to
greatness
but
you
could
not
say
consols
soared
to
even
commonplace
subjects
may
be
illustrated
by
metaphor
for
it
is
a
metaphor
and
quite
unobjectionable
to
say
consols
mounted
or
jumped
to
but
commonplace
subjects
must
be
illustrated
by
metaphor
that
is
commonplace
order
of
words
in
a
sentence
emphatic
words
must
stand
in
emphatic
positions
ie
for
the
most
part
at
the
beginning
or
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
this
rule
occasionally
supersedes
the
common
rules
about
position
thus
the
place
for
an
adverb
as
a
rule
should
be
between
the
subject
and
verb
he
quickly
left
the
room
but
if
quickly
is
to
be
emphatic
it
must
come
at
the
beginning
or
end
as
in
i
told
him
to
leave
the
room
slowly
but
he
left
quickly
adjectives
in
clauses
beginning
with
if
and
though
often
come
at
the
beginning
for
emphasis
insolent
though
he
was
he
was
silenced
at
last
a
unemphatic
words
must
as
a
rule
be
kept
from
the
end
of
the
sentence
it
is
a
common
fault
to
break
this
rule
by
placing
a
short
and
unemphatic
predicate
at
the
end
of
a
long
sentence
to
know
some
latin
even
if
it
be
nothing
but
a
few
latin
roots
is
useful
write
it
is
useful
c
so
the
evidence
proves
how
kind
to
his
inferiors
he
is
often
where
an
adjective
or
auxiliary
verb
comes
at
the
end
the
addition
of
an
emphatic
adverb
justifies
the
position
eg
above
is
very
useful
he
has
invariably
been
a
short
chippy
ending
even
though
emphatic
is
to
be
avoided
it
is
abrupt
and
unrhythmical
eg
the
soldier
transfixed
with
the
spear
writhed
we
want
a
longer
ending
fell
writhing
to
the
ground
or
writhed
in
the
agonies
of
death
a
chippy
ending
is
common
in
bad
construing
from
virgil
exceptionsprepositions
and
pronouns
attached
to
emphatic
words
need
not
be
moved
from
the
end
eg
he
does
no
harm
that
i
hear
of
bear
witness
how
i
loved
him
nb
in
all
styles
especially
in
letterwriting
a
final
emphasis
must
not
be
so
frequent
as
to
become
obtrusive
and
monotonous
b
an
interrogation
sometimes
gives
emphasis
no
one
can
doubt
that
the
prisoner
had
he
been
really
guilty
would
have
shown
some
signs
of
remorse
is
not
so
emphatic
as
who
can
doubt
is
it
possible
to
doubt
c
contrast
no
one
ever
names
wentworth
without
thinking
of
c
with
but
wentworthwho
ever
names
him
without
thinking
of
those
harsh
dark
features
ennobled
by
their
expression
into
more
than
the
majesty
of
an
antique
jupiter
the
subject
if
unusually
emphatic
should
often
be
removed
from
the
beginning
of
the
sentence
the
beginning
of
the
sentence
is
an
emphatic
position
though
mostly
not
so
emphatic
as
the
end
therefore
the
principal
subject
of
a
sentence
being
emphatic
and
being
wanted
early
in
the
sentence
to
tell
us
what
the
sentence
is
about
comes
as
a
rule
at
or
near
the
beginning
thomas
built
this
house
hence
since
the
beginning
is
the
usual
place
for
the
subject
if
we
want
to
emphasize
thomas
unusually
we
must
remove
thomas
from
the
beginning
this
house
was
built
by
thomas
or
it
was
thomas
that
built
this
house
thus
the
emphasis
on
conqueror
is
not
quite
so
strong
in
a
mere
conqueror
ought
not
to
obtain
from
us
the
reverence
that
is
due
to
the
great
benefactors
of
mankind
as
in
we
ought
not
to
bestow
the
reverence
that
is
due
to
the
great
benefactors
of
mankind
upon
a
mere
conqueror
considerable
but
less
emphasis
and
greater
smoothness
will
be
obtained
by
writing
the
sentence
thus
we
ought
not
to
bestow
upon
a
mere
conqueror
c
where
the
same
subject
stands
first
in
several
consecutive
sentences
it
rises
in
emphasis
and
need
not
be
removed
from
the
beginning
even
though
unusual
emphasis
be
required
the
captain
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
expedition
he
first
pointed
out
the
possibility
of
advancing
he
warned
them
of
the
approaching
scarcity
of
provisions
he
showed
how
they
might
replenish
their
exhausted
stock
c
the
object
is
sometimes
placed
before
the
verb
for
emphasis
this
is
most
common
in
antithesis
jesus
i
know
and
paul
i
know
but
who
are
ye
some
he
imprisoned
others
he
put
to
death
even
where
there
is
no
antithesis
the
inversion
is
not
uncommon
military
courage
the
boast
of
the
sottish
german
of
the
frivolous
and
prating
frenchman
of
the
romantic
and
arrogant
spaniard
he
neither
possesses
nor
values
this
inversion
sometimes
creates
ambiguity
in
poetry
eg
the
son
the
father
slew
and
must
be
sparingly
used
in
prose
sometimes
the
position
of
a
word
may
be
considered
appropriate
by
some
and
inappropriate
by
others
according
to
different
interpretations
of
the
sentence
take
as
an
example
early
in
the
morning
the
nobles
and
gentlemen
who
attended
on
the
king
assembled
in
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
and
here
they
began
to
talk
of
what
a
dreadful
storm
it
had
been
the
night
before
but
macbeth
could
scarcely
understand
what
they
said
for
he
was
thinking
of
something
worse
the
last
sentence
has
been
amended
by
professor
bain
into
what
they
said
macbeth
could
scarcely
understand
but
there
appears
to
be
an
antithesis
between
the
guiltless
nobles
who
can
think
about
the
weather
and
the
guilty
macbeth
who
cannot
hence
what
they
said
ought
not
and
macbeth
ought
to
be
emphasized
and
therefore
macbeth
ought
to
be
retained
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentence

the
one
hand
and

remained
as
yet
unrivalled
on
the
other

putting
the
emphatic
words
in
their
emphatic
place
at
the
end
where
several
words
are
emphatic
make
it
clear
which
is
the
most
emphatic

made
under
the
pretence

in

the
prize

to
each
of
these
opposite
parties
it
is
unpleasantly
doubtful
whether
the
writer
means
state
or
parties
to
be
emphatic
if
as
for
the

these
two
parties

thus
instead
of
to

this
they
used
all
devices
we
can

to

this
they
used
every
conceivable
device
so
if
we
want
to

fidelity
in
the
business
will
task
your
skill
and
fidelity
we
can
write
not
only
your
skill
but
also
your
fidelity
this
however
sometimes
leads
to
exaggerations
see
sometimes
antithesis
gives
emphasis
as
in
you
do
not
know
this
but
you
shall
know
it
where
antithesis
cannot
be
used
the
emphasis
must
be
expressed
by
turning
the
sentence
as
i
will
make
you
know
it
or
by
some
addition
as
you
shall
hereafter
know
it
words

only
requires
careful
use
the
strict
rule
is
that
only
should
be
placed
before
the
word
affected
by
it
the
following
is
ambiguous
the
heavens
are
not
open
to
the
faithful
only
at
intervals
the
best
rule
is
to
avoid
placing
only
between
two
emphatic
words
and
to
avoid
using
only
where
alone
can
be
used
instead
in
strictness
perhaps
the
three
following
sentences
he
only
beat
three
he
beat
only
three
he
beat
three
only
ought
to
be
explained
severally
thus
he
did
no
more
than
beat
did
not
kill
three
he
beat
no
more
than
three
he
beat
three
and
that
was
all
he
did
here
only
modifies
the
whole
of
the
sentence
and
depreciates
the
action
but
the
best
authors
sometimes
transpose
the
word
he
only
lived
ought
to
mean
he
did
not
die
or
make
any
great
sacrifice
but
he
only
lived
but
till
he
was
a
man
macbeth
v
means
he
lived
only
till
he
was
a
man
compare
also
who
only
hath
immortality
only
at
the
beginning
of
a
statement
but
i
dont
like
to
importune
you
only
i
know
youll
forgive
me
before
an
imperative
it
diminishes
the
favour
asked
only
listen
to
me
this
use
of
only
is
mostly
confined
to
letters
very
often
only
at
the
beginning
of
a
sentence
is
used
for
alone
only
ten
came
only
caesar
approved
alone
is
less
ambiguous
the
ambiguity
of
only
is
illustrated
by
such
a
sentence
as
dont
hesitate
to
bring
a
few
friends
of
yours
to
shoot
on
my
estate
at
any
time
only

fifteen

so
many
as
fifteen
or
else
dont
hesitate
to
bring
a
few
more
no
more
than
five
came
yesterday
in
conversation
ambiguity
is
prevented
by
emphasis
but
in
a
letter
only
thus
used
might
cause
unfortunate
mistakes
write
yesterday
only
five
came
if
you
mean
no
more
than
five
when
not
only
precedes
but
also
see
that
each
is
followed
by
the
same
part
of
speech
he
not

gave
me
advice

also

is
wrong

on
the
other
hand
he

also

me
a
dictionary
is
right
take
an
instance
he

this

a
large
public
meeting
and
his
speeches
were
not
only
successful
but
also
adjective
worthy
of
success
at
least
always
and
other
adverbial
adjuncts
sometimes
produce
ambiguity
i
think
you
will
find
my
latin
exercise
at
all
events
as
good
as
my
cousins
does
this
mean
my
latin
exercise
though
not
perhaps
my
other
exercises
or
though
not
very
good
yet
at
all
events
as
good
as
my

write
for
my

at

you

and
for
i
think
you

find
my

exercise
as
good
as
my
cousins
at
all
events
the
remedy
is
to
avoid
placing
at
all
events
between
two
emphatic
words
as
an
example
of
the
misplacing
of
an
adverbial
adjunct
take
from
abroad
he
received
most
favourable
reports
but
in
the
city
he
heard
that
a
panic
had
broken
out
on
the
exchange
and
that
the
funds
were
fast
falling
this
ought
to
mean
that
the
hearing
and
not
as
is
intended
that
the
breaking
out
of
the
panic
took
place
in
the
city
in
practice
an
adverb
is
often
used
to
qualify
a
remote
word
where
the
latter
is
more
emphatic
than
any
nearer
word
this
is
very
common
when
the
adverbial
adjunct
is
placed
in
an
emphatic
position
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentence
on
this
very
spot
our
guide
declared
that
claverhouse
had
fallen
nouns
should
be
placed
near
the
nouns
that
they
define
in
the
very
common
sentence
the
death
is
announced
of
mr
john
smith
an
author
whose
works
c
the
transposition
is
probably
made
from
a
feeling
that
if
we
write
the
death
of
mr
john
smith
is
announced
we
shall
be
obliged
to
begin
a
new
sentence
he
was
an
author
whose
works
c
but
the
difficulty
can
be
removed
by
writing
we
regret
to
announce
or
we
are
informed
of
the
death
of
mr
john
smith
an
author
c
pronouns
should
follow
the
nouns
to
which
they
refer
without
the
intervention
of
another
noun
avoid
john
smith
the
son
of
thomas
smith
who
gave
me
this
book
unless
thomas
smith
is
the
antecedent
of
who
avoid
also
john
supplied
thomas
with
money
he
john
was
very
well
off
when
however
one
of
two
preceding
nouns
is
decidedly
superior
to
the
other
in
emphasis
the
more
emphatic
may
be
presumed
to
be
the
noun
referred
to
by
the
pronoun
even
though
the
noun
of
inferior
emphasis
intervenes
thus
at
this
moment
the
colonel
came
up
and
took
the
place
of
the
wounded
general
he
gave
orders
to
halt
here
he
would
naturally
refer
to
colonel
though
general
intervenes
a
conjunction
will
often
show
that
a
pronoun
refers
to
the
subject
of
the
preceding
sentence
and
not
to
another
intervening
noun
the
sentinel
at
once
took
aim
at
the
approaching
soldier
and
fired
he
then
retreated
to
give
the
alarm
it
is
better
to
adhere
in
most
cases
to
rule
which
may
be
called
bain
the
rule
of
proximity
the
rule
of
emphasis
of
which
an
instance
was
given
in
the
last
paragraph
is
sometimes
misleading
a
distinction
might
be
drawn
by
punctuating
thus
david
the
father
of
solomon
who
slew
goliath
david
the
father
of
solomon
who
built
the
temple
but
the
propriety
of
omitting
a
comma
in
each
case
is
questionable
and
it
is
better
to
write
so
as
not
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
commas
clauses
that
are
grammatically
connected
should
be
kept
as
close
together
as
possible
but
see
the
introduction
of
parentheses
violating
this
rule
often
produced
serious
ambiguity
thus
in
the
following
the
result
of
these
observations
appears
to
be
in
opposition
to
the
view
now
generally
received
in
this
country
that
in
muscular
effort
the
substance
of
the
muscle
itself
undergoes
disintegration
here
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
the
theory
of
disintegration
is
the
result
or
as
the
absence
of
a
comma
after
be
would
indicate
in
opposition
to
the
result
of
these
observations
if
is
intended
add
and
to
prove
after
country
if
insert
which
is
after
country
there
is
an
excessive
complication
in
the
followingit
cannot
at
all
events
if
the
consideration
demanded
by
a
subject
of
such
importance
from
any
one
professing
to
be
a
philosopher
be
given
be
denied
that
c
where
a
speaker
feels
that
his
hearers
have
forgotten
the
connection
of
the
beginning
of
the
sentence
he
should
repeat
what
he
has
said
eg
after
the
long
parenthesis
in
the
last
sentence
he
should
recommence
it
cannot
i
say
be
denied
in
writing
however
this
licence
must
be
sparingly
used
a
short
parenthesis
or
modifying
clause
will
not
interfere
with
clearness
especially
if
antithesis
he
used
so
as
to
show
the
connection
between
the
different
parts
of
the
sentence
eg
a
modern
newspaper
statement
though
probably
true
would
be
laughed
at
if
quoted
in
a
book
as
testimony
but
the
letter
of
a
court
gossip
is
thought
good
historical
evidence
if
written
some
centuries
ago
here
to
place
though
probably
true
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentence
would
not
add
clearness
and
would
impair
the
emphasis
of
the
contrast
between
a
modern
newspaper
statement
and
the
letter
of
a
court
gossip
in
conditional
sentences
the
antecedent
clauses
must
be
kept
distinct
from
the
consequent
clausesthere
is
ambiguity
in
the
lesson
intended
to
be
taught
by
these
manoeuvres
will
be
lost
if
the
plan
of
operations
is
laid
down
too
definitely
beforehand
and
the
affair
degenerates
into
a
mere
review
begin
in
any
case
with
the
antecedent
if
the
plan
c
next
write
according
to
the
meaning
if
the
plan
is
laid
down
and
the
affair
degenerates
c
then
the
lesson
will
be
lost
or
then
the
lesson
will
be
lost
and
the
affair
degenerates
into
a
mere
review
dependent
clauses
preceded
by
that
should
be
kept
distinct
from
those
that
are
independent
take
as
an
example
he
replied
that
he
wished
to
help
them
and
intended
to
make
preparations
accordingly
this
ought
not
to
be
used
though
it
sometimes
is
for
shortness
to
mean
he
replied
and
he
intended
in
intended
having
no
subject
must
be
supposed
to
be
connected
with
the
nearest
preceding
verb
in
the
same
mood
and
tense
that
has
a
subject
ie
wished
it
follows
that
is
a
condensation
of
he
replied
that
he
wished
and
that
he
intended
though
theoretically
free
from
ambiguity
is
practically
ambiguous
owing
to
a
loose
habit
of
repeating
the
subject
unnecessarily
it
would
be
better
to
insert
a
conjunctional
word
or
a
full
stop
between
the
two
statements
thus
he
replied
that
he
wished
to
help
them
and
indeed
he
intended
c
or
he
replied
c
he
intended
c
where
there
is
any
danger
of
ambiguity
use
or
in
preference
to
or
when
there
are
several
infinitives
those
that
are
dependent
on
the
same
word
must
be
kept
distinct
from
those
that
are
not
he
said
that
he
wished
to
take
his
friend
with
him
to
visit
the
capital
and
to
study
medicine
here
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
meaning
is
he
said
that
he
wished
to
take
his
friend
with
him
and
also
to
visit
the
capital
and
study
medicine
or
that
his
friend
might
visit
the
capital
and
might
also
study
medicine
or
on
a
visit
to
the
capital
and
that
he
also
wished
to
study
medicine
from
the
three
different
versions
it
will
be
perceived
that
this
ambiguity
must
be
met
a
by
using
that
for
to
which
allows
us
to
repeat
an
auxiliary
verb
eg
might
in
and
b
by
inserting
conjunctions
as
to
insertions
of
conjunctions
see
in
order
to
and
for
the
purpose
of
can
be
used
to
distinguish
wherever
there
is
any
ambiguity
between
an
infinitive
that
expresses
a
purpose
and
an
infinitive
that
does
not
eg
he
told
his
servant
to
call
upon
his
friend
to
in
order
to
give
him
information
about
the
trains
and
not
to
leave
him
till
he
started
the
principle
of
suspense
write
your
sentence
in
such
a
way
that
until
he
has
come
to
the
full
stop
the
reader
may
feel
the
sentence
to
be
incomplete
in
other
words
keep
your
reader
in
suspense
suspense
is
caused
by
placing
the
ifclause
first
and
not
last
in
a
conditional
sentence
by
placing
participles
before
the
words
they
qualify
by
using
suspensive
conjunctions
eg
not
only
either
partly
on
the
one
hand
in
the
first
place
c
the
following
is
an
example
of
an
unsuspended
sentence
the
sense
draggles
and
it
is
difficult
to
keep
up
ones
attention
mr
pym
was
looked
upon
as
the
man
of
greatest
experience
in
parliaments
where
he
had
served
very
long
and
was
always
a
man
of
business
being
an
officer
in
the
exchequer
and
of
a
good
reputation
generally
though
known
to
be
inclined
to
the
puritan
party
yet
not
of
those
furious
resolutions
mod
eng
so
furiously
resolved
against
the
church
as
the
other
leading
men
were
and
wholly
devoted
to
the
earl
of
bedfordwho
had
nothing
of
that
spirit
the
foregoing
sentence
might
have
ended
at
any
one
of
the
eight
points
marked
above
when
suspended
it
becomes
mr
pym
owing
to
his
long
service
in
parliament
in
the
exchequer
was
esteemed
above
all
others
for
his
parliamentary
experience
and
for
his
knowledge
of
business
he
had
also
a
good
reputation
generally
for
though
openly
favouring
the
puritan
party
he
was
closely
devoted
to
the
earl
of
bedford
and
like
the
earl
had
none
of
the
fanatical
spirit
manifested
against
the
church
by
the
other
leading
men
a
it
is
a
violation
of
the
principle
of
suspense
to
introduce
unexpectedly
at
the
end
of
a
long
sentence
some
short
and
unemphatic
clause
beginning
with
a
not
or
b
which
a
this
reform
has
already
been
highly
beneficial
to
all
classes
of
our
countrymen
and
will
i
am
persuaded
encourage
among
us
industry
selfdependence
and
frugality
and
not
as
some
say
wastefulness
write
not
as
some
say
wastefulness
but
industry
selfdependence
and
frugality
b
after
a
long
and
tedious
journey
the
last
part
of
which
was
a
little
dangerous
owing
to
the
state
of
the
roads
we
arrived
safely
at
york
which
is
a
fine
old
town
exceptionwhen
the
short
final
clause
is
intended
to
be
unexpectedly
unemphatic
it
comes
in
appropriately
with
something
of
the
sting
of
an
epigram
see
thus
the
old
miser
said
that
he
should
have
been
delighted
to
give
the
poor
fellow
a
shilling
but
most
unfortunately
he
had
left
his
purse
at
homea
habit
of
his
suspense
naturally
throws
increased
emphasis
on
the
words
for
which
we
are
waiting
ie
on
the
end
of
the
sentence
it
has
been
pointed
out
above
that
a
monotony
of
final
emphasis
is
objectionable
especially
in
letter
writing
and
conversation
suspense
must
not
be
excessive
excess
of
suspense
is
a
common
fault
in
boys
translating
from
latin
themistocles
having
secured
the
safety
of
greece
the
persian
fleet
being
now
destroyed
when
he
had
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
persuade
the
greeks
to
break
down
the
bridge
across
the
hellespont
hearing
that
xerxes
was
in
full
flight
and
thinking
that
it
might
be
profitable
to
secure
the
friendship
of
the
king
wrote
as
follows
to
him
the
more
english
idiom
is
when
themistocles
had
secured
the
safety
of
greece
by
the
destruction
of
the
persian
fleet
he
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
persuade
the
greeks
to
break
down
the
bridge
across
the
hellespont
soon
afterwards
hearing
c
a
long
suspense
that
would
be
intolerable
in
prose
is
tolerable
in
the
introduction
to
a
poem

the
long
interval
at

quiet
as

in
a
long
conditional
sentence

everyone
will
see
the
flatness
of
revenge
thy
fathers
most
unnatural
murder
if
thou
didst
ever
love
him
as
compared
with
the
suspense
that
forces
an
expression

if
thou
didst
ever
thy
dear

love

o

revenge
his
foul
and
most
unnatural

the
effect
is
sometimes
almost
ludicrous
when
the

and
complicated

when
it
precedes

it
ought
to
be
very
emphatic
if
you

here
the
introduction
of
a
clause
with
if
or
though
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
may
often
cause
ambiguity
especially
when
a
great
part
of
the
sentence
depends
on
that
his
enemies
answered
that
for
the
sake
of
preserving
the
public
peace
they
would
keep
quiet
for
the
present
though
he
declared
that
cowardice
was
the
motive
of
the
delay
and
that
for
this
reason
they
would
put
off
the
trial
to
a
more
convenient
season
see
suspense
is
gained
by
placing
a
participle
or
adjective
that
qualifies
the
subject
before
the
subject
deserted
by
his
friends
he
was
forced
to
have
recourse
to
those
that
had
been
his
enemies
here
if
we
write
he
deserted
by
his
friends
was
forced
c
he
is
unduly
emphasized
and
if
we
write
he
was
forced
to
have
recourse
to
his
enemies
having
been
deserted
by
his
friends
the
effect
is
very
flat
of
course
we
might
sometimes
write
he
was
deserted
and
forced
c
but
this
cannot
be
done
where
the
desertion
is
to
be
not
stated
but
implied
often
when
a
participle
qualifying
the
subject
is
introduced
late
in
the
sentence
it
causes
positive
ambiguity
with
this
small
force
the
general
determined
to
attack
the
foe
flushed
with
recent
victory
and
rendered
negligent
by
success
an
excessive
use
of
the
suspensive
participle
is
french
and
objectionable
eg
careless
by
nature
and
too
much
engaged
with
business
to
think
of
the
morrow
spoiled
by
a
longestablished
liberty
and
a
fabulous
prosperity
having
for
many
generations
forgotten
the
scourge
of
war
we
allow
ourselves
to
drift
on
without
taking
heed
of
the
signs
of
the
times
the
remedy
is
to
convert
the
participle
into
a
verb
depending
on
a
conjunction
because
we
are
by
nature
careless
c
or
to
convert
the
participle
into
a
verb
coordinate
with
the
principal
verb
eg
we
are
by
nature
careless
c
and
therefore
we
allow
ourselves
c
suspensive
conjunctions
eg

perilous

success
is
uncertain
and
failure
disgraceful
as
well
as
ruinous
or
else
the
liberty
of
your
country
is
endangered
here
the
meaning
is
liable
to
be
misunderstood
till
the
reader
has
gone
half
through
the
sentence
write
either
you
must
c
and
the
reader
is
from
the
first
prepared
for
an
alternative
other
suspensive
conjunctions
or
phrases
are
partly
for
our
part
in
the
first
place
it
is
true
doubtless
of
course
though
on
the
one
hand
repeat
the
subject
when
the
omission
would
cause
ambiguity
or
obscuritythe
omission
is
particularly
likely
to
cause
obscurity

a
relative

as
subject

professes
to

helping
the
nation

in
reality
is

from

flattery

a

which
though
possessing
great
wealth

power
and
though
long
backed
by
persecuting
laws
had
in
the
course
of
many
generations
been
found
unable
to
propagate
its
doctrines

barely
able

a

so
odious
that
fraud
and
violence
when
used

were
generally
regarded

it
is
a
help
to
clearness
when
the

part
of

prepares
the
way
for

the
middle
for
the
end
in
a
kind
of
ascent
this
ascent
is
called

how
they

the
clearness
of

but
is
in

the
neglect
of

produces
an
abruptness
that
interferes
with

sudden
and
apparently
unnecessary
change
of
construction
causes
awkwardness
and
roughness
at
least
and
sometimes
breaks
the
flow
of
the
sentence
so
seriously
as
to
cause
perplexity
thus
write
virtuous
and
accomplished
or
of
many
virtues
and
accomplishments
not
of
many
virtues
and
accomplished
riding
or
walking
or
on

or

not
on

riding
in
the
same
way
do
not
put
adjectives
and
participles
active
and
passive
forms
of
verbs
in
too
close
juxtaposition
avoid
such
sentences
as
the
following
he

reason
to

an
accident
accidental
but
premeditated

for

else
for
believing

by

be
forced
by
the
treachery
of
the
governor

the
indolent
indolence
of

a
week
they
accused
him
of
being
bribed
receiving
bribes
from
by

and
unwilling

antithesis
adds
force
and
often
clearnessthe
meaning
of
liberal
in
the
following
sentence
is
ascertained
by
the
antithesis
all
the
pleasing
illusions
which
made
powera
gentleb
and
obediencea
liberalb
are
now
to
be
destroyed
there
is
a
kind
of
proportion
as
gentleness
is
to
power
so
liberality
in
the
sense
here
used
is
to
obedience
now
gentleness
is
the
check
on
the
excess
of
power
therefore
liberal
here
applies
to
that
which
checks
the
excess
of
obedience
ie
checks
servility
hence
liberal
here
means
free
the
contrast
also
adds
force
they

the
rulea
not
at

destructiona
of

wealthe
epigramit
has
been
seen
that
the
neglect
of
climax
results
in
lameness
sometimes
the
suddenness
of
the
descent
produces
amusement
and
when
the
descent
is
intentional
and
very
sudden
the
effect
is
striking
as
well
as
amusing
thus
you

epigram
may
be
defined
as
a
short
sentence
expressing

an
amusing
appearance

full

flat
also
like
yesterdays
times
verbosity
is
cured
not
by
a
small
but
by
a
large
vocabulary
the
name
of
epigram
may
sometimes
be
given
to
a
mere
antithesis
eg
an
educated
man
should
know
something
of
everything
and
everything
of
something
let
each
sentence
have
one
and
only
one
principal
subject
of
thought
this
great
and
good
man
died
on
the
th
of
september
leaving
behind
him
the
memory
of
many
noble
actions
and
a
numerous
family
of
whom
three
were
sons
one
of
them
george
the
eldest
heir
to
his
fathers
virtues
as
well
as
to
his
principal
estates

most
of
his

property
was
situate
and
shortly
afterwards
elected
member
for
the
county
which
had
for
several
generations
returned
this

to
serve
in
parliament
here
we
have
the
great
and
good
man
george
the
county
disputing
which
is
to
be
considered
the
principal
subject
two
if
not
three
sentences
should
have
been
made
instead
of
one
carefully
avoid
a
long
sentence
like
this
treating
of
many
different
subjects
on
one
level
it
is
called
heterogeneous
the
connection
between
different
sentences
must
be
kept
up
by
adverbs
used
as
conjunctions
or
by
means
of
some
other
connecting
words
at
the
beginning
of
each
sentenceleave
out
the
conjunctions
and
other
connecting
words
and
it
will
be
seen
that
the
following
sentences
lose
much
of
their
meaning
pitt
was
in
the
army
for
a
few
months
in
time
of
peace
his
biographer
accordingly
insists
on
our
confessing
that
if
the
young
cornet
had
remained
in
the
service
he
would
have
been
one
of
the
ablest
commanders
that
ever
lived

this
is
not
all
pitt
it
seems
was
not
merely
a
great
poet
in
esse
and
a
great
general
in
posse
but
a
finished
example
of
moral
excellence
the
truth
is
that
there
scarcely
ever
lived
a
person
who
had
so
little
claim
to
this
sort
of
praise
as
pitt
he
was
undoubtedly
a
great
man
but
his
was
not
a
complete
and
wellproportioned
greatness
the
public
life
of
hampden
or
of
somers
resembles
a
regular
drama
which
can
be
criticised
as
a
whole
and
every
scene
of
which
is
to
be
viewed
in
connection
with
the
main
action
the
public
life
of

on
mature
consideration
i
am
disposed
to
adopt
that
here

of

also
conducive

professor
bain
says
in

conveyed

briefer

not
so
brief
as
uneasy
lies

where
the
effect
of

the

is
almost
restricted

may
sometimes

humanizing

therefore

it

write
more
briefly
and
effectively
gladiatorial
shows
were
first
discouraged
and
finally
put
down
by
the
humanizing
spirit
of
christianity
so
instead
of

the

sometimes
a

a
statement
it

that

deliberately
preferred

ie
by
the
swiss
because
they
were
mountaineers
and
hardy
the
deed
was
applauded
by
all
honest
men
but
the

affected
to
treat
it
as

and
set
a
price
upon
the

of
him

cautiondifferent
names
must
not
be
used
for
the
same
person
unless
each
of
them
derives
an
appropriateness
from
its
context
thus
if
we
are
writing
about
charles

it
would
be
in
very
bad
taste
to
avoid
repeating
he
by
using
such
periphrases
as
the

c
conjunctions
may
be
omitted
the
omission
gives
a
certain
forcible
abruptness
eg
you
say
this
i
on
the
other
hand
deny
it
when
sentences
are
short
as
in
macaulays
writings
conjunctions
may
be
advantageously
omitted
where
a
contrast
is
intended
the
conjunction
but
usually
prepares
the
way
for
the
second
of
the
two
contrasted
terms
he
is
good
but
dull
where
and
is
used
instead
of

the
incongruity
savours
of
epigram

prosily
he

false

you

apposition
may
be
used
so
as
to
convert
two
sentences
into
one
we
called
at
the
house
of
a
person
to
whom
we
had
letters
of
introduction
a
musician
and
what
is
more
a
good
friend
to
all
young
students
of
music
this
is
as
clear
as
and
briefer
than
he
was
a
musician
c
condensation
may
be
effected
by
not
repeating
the
common
subject
of
several
verbs
the
common
object
of
several
verbs
or
prepositions
he

here
for
many
years

esteem
of
all
the
citizens
he

city
is
shorter
than
he
came

such
condensation
often
causes
obscurity
and
even
where
there
is
no
obscurity
there
is
a
certain
harshness
in
pausing
on
light
unemphatic
words
such
as
to
in
c
as
in
the
first
example
tautologythe
fault
of
repeating
the
same
word
several
times
unnecessarily
is
called
tautology
eg
this
is
a
painful
circumstance
it
is
a
circumstance
that
i
much
regret
and
he
also
will
much
regret
the
circumstance
but
the
fault
is
not
to
be
avoided
by
using
different
words
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
this
is
a
painful
event
it
is
a
circumstance
that
i
much
regret
and
he
also
will
greatly
lament
the
occurrence
the
true
remedy
is
to
arrange
the
words
in
such
a
manner
that
there
may
be
no
unnecessary
repetition
thus
this
is
a
painful
circumstance
a
circumstance
that
causes
me
and
will
cause
him
deep
regret
the
repetition
of
the
same
meaning
in
slightly
different
words
is
a
worse
fault
than
the
repetition
of
the
same
word
see
for
examples
the
extract
from
sir
archibald
alison
at
the
end
of
the
book
thus
a
burning
thirst
for
conquests
is
a
characteristic
of
this
nation
it
is
an
ardent
passion
that

other
instances

is
so
infallible
that
it
is
never

c
parenthesis
may
be
used
with
advantage
to
brevity
we
are
all
and
who
would
not
be
offended
at
the
treatment
we
have
received
is
shorter
and
more
forcible
than
the
sentence
would
have
been
if
the
parenthesis
had
been
appended
in
a
separate
sentence
who
indeed
would
not
be
offended
extreme
care
must
however
be
taken
that
a
parenthesis
may
not
obscure
the
meaning
of
a
long
sentence
caution
let
clearness
be
the
first
consideration
it
is
best
at
all
events
for
beginners
not
to
aim
so
much
at
being
brief
or
forcible
as
at
being
perfectly
clear
horace
says
while
i
take
pains
to
be
brief
i
fall
into
obscurity
and
it
may
easily
be
seen
that
several
of
the
rules
for
brevity
interfere
with
the
rules
for
clearness
forcible
style
springs
from
vividness
and
exactness
of
thought
and
from
a
corresponding
vividness
and
exactness
in
the
use
of
words
when
you
are
describing
anything
endeavour
to
see
it
and
describe
it
as
you
see
it
if
you
are
writing
about
a
man
who
was
killed
see
the
man
before
you
and
ask
was
he
executed
cut
down
run
through
the
body
butchered
shot
or
hanged
if
you
are
writing
about
the
capture

was
the

surprised
surrendered

out
or
demolished
before
surrender
was
an

exactness
in
the
use
of
words
requires
an
exact
knowledge
of
their
meanings
and
differences

is
a

by
itself

a

it

following
exercises
consist
of
extracts
from
burnet
butler
and
clarendon
modernized
and
altered
with
a
view
to
remove
obscurity
and
ambiguity
the
modernized
version
will
necessarily
be
inferior
to
the

in
unity
of
style
and
in
some
other
respects
the
charm
of
the
authors
individuality
and
the
pleasant
ring
of
the
oldfashioned
english
are
lost
it
is
highly
necessary
that
the
student
should
recognize
this
and
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
sole
object
is
to
show
how
the
meaning
in
each
case
might
have
been
more
clearly
expressed
occasionally
expressions
have
been
altered
not
as
being
in
themselves
obscure
or
objectionable
but
as
indicating
a
habit
of
which
beginners
should
beware
for
example
in
the
extract
from
burnet
he
is
often
altered
not
because
in
the
particular
context
the
pronoun
presents
any
obscurity
but
because
burnets
habit
of
repeating
he
is
faulty
these
exercises
can
be
used
in
two
ways
the
pupil
may
either
have
his
book
open
and
be
questioned
on
the
reasons
for
each
alteration
or
after
studying
the
two
versions
he
may
have
the
original
version
dictated
to
him
and
then
he
may
reproduce
the
parallel
version
or
something
like
it

without

the
major

part

it
cannot
be

dear
doctor
mortimer
we
have
other
motives
beside
the
respect
and
gratitude
which
must
be
felt
for
you
by
all
those
of
your
old
pupils
who
are
capable
of
appreciating
the
work
you
did
at
the
city

school
for
asking
you
to
let
us
dedicate
to
you
a
little
book
which
we
have
entitled
english
lessons
for
english
people
looking
back
upon
our
school
life
we
both
feel
that
among
the
many
educational
advantages
which
we
enjoyed
under
your
care
there
was
none
more
important
than
the
study
of
the
works
of
shakspeare
to
which
we
and
our
schoolfellows
were
stimulated
by
the
special
prizes
of
the
beaufoy
endowment
we
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
not
always
owed
by
pupils
to
their
teachers
many
who
have
passed
into
a
life
of
engrossing
activity
without
having
been
taught
at
school
to
use
rightly
or
to
appreciate
the
right
use
of
their
native
tongue
feeling
themselves
foreigners
amid
the
language
of
their
country
may
turn
with
some
point
against
their
teachers
the
reproach
of
banished
bolingbroke
my
tongues
use
is
to
me
no
more
than
an
unstringed
viol
or
a
harp
or
like
a
cunning
instrument
cased
up
or
being
open
put
into
his
hands
that
knows
no
touch
to
tune
the
harmony
within
my
mouth
you
have
engaoled
my
tongue
doubly
portcullisd
with
my
teeth
and
lips
and
dull
unfeeling
barren
ignorance
is
made
my
gaoler
to
attend
on
me
i
am
too
old
to
fawn
upon
a
nurse
too
far
in
years
to
be
a
pupil
now
it
is
our
pleasant
duty
on
the
contrary
to
thank
you
for
encouraging
us
to
study
the
cunning
instrument
of
our
native
tongue
our
sense
of
the
benefits
which
we
derived
from
this
study
and
our
recollection
that
the
study
was
at
that
time
optional
and
did
not
affect
more
than
a
small
number
of
the
pupils
lead
us
to
anticipate
that
when
once
the
english
language
and
literature
become
recognized
not
as
an
optional
but
as
a
regular
part
of
our
educational
course
the
advantages
will
be
so
great
as
to
constitute
nothing
short
of
a
national
benefit
the
present
seems
to
be
a
critical
moment
for
english
instruction
the
subject
has
excited
much
attention
of
late
years
many
schools
have
already
taken
it
up
others
are
on
the
point
of
doing
so
it
forms
an
important
part
of
most
government
and
other
examinations
but
there
is
a
complaint
from
many
teachers
that
they
cannot
teach
english
for
want
of
textbooks
and
manuals
and
as
the
study
of
english
becomes
year
by
year
more
general
this
complaint
makes
itself
more
and
more
distinctly
heard
to
meet
this
want
we
have
written
the
following
pages
if
we
had
had
more
time
we
might
perhaps
have
been
tempted
to
aim
at
producing
a
more
learned
and
exhaustive
book
on
the
subject
but
setting
aside
want
of
leisure
we
feel
that
a
practical
textbook
and
not
a
learned
or
exhaustive
treatise
is
what
is
wanted
at
the
present
crisis
we
feel
sure
that
you
will
give
a
kindly
welcome
to
our
little
book
as
an
attempt
however
imperfect
to
hand
on
the
torch
which
you
have
handed
to
us
we
beg
you
also
to
accept
it
as
a
token
of
our
sincere
gratitude
for
more
than
ordinary
kindnesses
and
to
believe
us

affectionate

the
object
of
this
book
is
evidently
a
practical
one
it
is
intended
for
ordinary
use
by
a
large
circle
of
readers
and
though
designed
principally
for
boys
may
be
read
with
advantage
by
many
of
more
advanced
years
one
of
the
lessons
which
it
professes
to
teach
to
use
the
right
word
in
the
right
place
is
one
which
no
one
should
despise
the
accomplishment
is
a
rare
one
and
many
of
the
hints
here
given
are
truly
admirable
from
the
southern
review
the
study
of
language
can
never
be
exhausted
every
time
it
is
looked
at
by
a
man
of
real
ability
and
culture
some
new
phase
starts
into
view
the
origin
of
language
its
relations
to
the
mind
its
history
its
laws
its
development
its
struggles
its
triumphs
its
devices
its
puzzles
its

thing
about
it
is
full
of
interest
here
is
a
delightful
book
by
two
men
of
recognized
authoritythe
head
master
of
london
school
and
the
professor
of
modern
history
in
the
university
of
cambridge
the
notable
author
of
ecce
homo
the
book
is
so
comprehensive
in
its
scope
that
it
seems
almost
miscellaneous
it
treats
of
the
vocabulary
of
the
english
language
diction
as
appropriate
to
this
or
that
sort
of
composition
selection
and
arguments
of
topics
metre
and
an
appendix
on
logic
all
this
in
less
than
three
hundred
pages
within
this
space
so
many
subjects
cannot
be
treated
exhaustively
and
no
one
is
unless
we
may
except
metre
to
which
about
eighty
pages
are
devoted
and
about
which
all
seems
to
be
said
that
is
worth
sayingpossibly
more
but
on
each
topic
some
of
the
best
things
are
said
in
a
very
stimulating
way
the
student
will
desire
to
study
more
thoroughly
the
subject
into
which
such
pleasant
openings
are
here
given
and
the
best
prepared
teacher
will
be
thankful
for
the
number
of
striking
illustrations
gathered
up
to
his

the
abundance
and
freshness

boston
preface
this
book
is
not
intended
to
supply
the
place
of
an
english
grammar
it
presupposes
a
knowledge
of
grammar
and
of
english
idiom
in
its
readers
and
does
not
address
itself
to
foreigners
but
to
those
who
having
already
a
familiar
knowledge
of
english
need
help
to
write
it
with
taste
and
exactness
some
degree
of
knowledge
is
presumed
in
the
reader
nevertheless
we
do
not
presume
that
he
possesses
so
much
as
to
render
him
incapable
of
profiting
from
lessons
our
object
is
if
possible
not
merely
to
interest
but
to
teach
to
write
lessons
not
essayslessons
that
may
perhaps
prove
interesting
to
some
who
have
passed
beyond
the
routine
of
school
life
but
still
lessons
in
the
strictest
sense
adapted
for
school
classes
aiming
at
practical
utility
the
book
deals
only
with
those
difficulties
which
in
the
course
of
teaching
we
have
found
to
be
most
common
and
most
serious
for
there
are
many
difficulties
even
when
grammatical
accuracy
has
been
attained
in
the
way
of
english
persons
attempting
to
write
and
speak
correctly
first
there
is
the
cramping
restriction
of
an
insufficient
vocabulary
not
merely
a
loose
and
inexact
apprehension
of
many
words
that
are
commonly
used
and
a
consequent
difficulty
in
using
them
accurately
but
also
a
total
ignorance
of
many
other
words
and
an
inability
to
use
them
at
all
and
these
last
are
as
a
rule
the
very
words
which
are
absolutely
necessary
for
the
comprehension
and
expression
of
any
thought
that
deals
with
something
more
than
the
most
ordinary
concrete
notions
there
is
also
a
very
common
inability
to
appreciate
the
differences
between
words
that
are
at
all
similar
lastly
where
the
pupil
has
studied
latin
and
trusts
too
much
for
his
knowledge
of
english
words
to
his
knowledge
of
their
latin
roots
there
is
the
possibility
of
misderiving
and
misunderstanding
a
word
owing
to
ignorance
of
the
changes
of
letters
introduced
in
the
process
of
derivation
and
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
danger
of
misunderstanding
and
pedantically
misusing
words
correctly
derived
from
an
ignorance
of
the
changes
of
meaning
which
a
word
almost
always
experiences
in
passing
from
one
language
to
another
the
result
of
all
this
nonunderstanding
or
slovenly
halfunderstanding
of
words
is
a
habit
of
slovenly
reading
and
slovenly
writing
which
when
once
acquired
is
very
hard
to
shake
off
then
following
on
the
difficulties
attending
the
use
of
words
there
are
others
attending
the
choice
and
arrangement
of
words
there
is
the
danger
of
falling
into
poetic
prose
of
thinking
it
necessary
to
write
steed
or
charger
instead
of
horse
ire
instead
of
anger
and
the
like
and
every
teacher
who
has
had
much
experience
in
looking
over
examination
papers
will
admit
that
this
is
a
danger
to
which
beginners
are
very
liable
again
there
is
the
temptation
to
shrink
with
a
senseless
fear
from
using
a
plain
word
twice
in
the
same
page
and
often
from
using
a
plain
word
at
all
this
unmanly
dread
of
simplicity
and
of
what
is
called
tautology
gives
rise
to
a
patchwork
made
up
of
scraps
of
poetic
quotations
unmeaning
periphrases
and
wouldbe
humorous
circumlocutionsa
style
of
all
styles
perhaps
the
most
objectionable
and
offensive
which
may
be
known
and
avoided
by
the
name
of
fine
writing
lastly
there
is
the
danger
of
obscurity
a
fault
which
cannot
be
avoided
without
extreme
care
owing
to
the
uninflected
nature
of
our
language
all
these
difficulties
and
dangers
are
quite
as
real
and
require
as
much
attention
and
are
fit
subjects
for
practical
teaching
in
our
schools
quite
as
much
as
many
points
which
at
present
receive
perhaps
an
excessive
attention
in
some
of
our
textbooks
to
use
the
right
word
in
the
right
place
is
an
accomplishment
not
less
valuable
than
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
carefully
recorded
in
most
english
grammars
and
often
inflicted
as
a
task
upon
younger
pupils
that
the
plural
of
cherub
is
cherubim
and
the
feminine
of
bull
is
cow
to
smooth
the
readers
way
through
these
difficulties
is
the
object
of
the
first
three
parts
of
this
book
difficulties
connected
with
vocabulary
are
considered
first
the
student
is
introduced
almost
at
once
to
synonyms
he
is
taught
how
to
define
a
word
with
and
without
the
aid
of
its
synonyms
he
is
shown
how
to
eliminate
from
a
word
whatever
is
not
essential
to
its
meaning
the
processes
of
definition
and
elimination
are
carefully
explained
a
system
or
scheme
is
laid
down
which
he
can
exactly
follow
and
examples
are
subjoined
worked
out
to
illustrate
the
method
which
he
is
to
pursue
a
system
is
also
given
by
which
the
reader
may
enlarge
his
vocabulary
and
furnish
himself
easily
and
naturally
with
those
general
or
abstract
terms
which
are
often
misunderstood
and
misused
and
still
more
often
not
understood
and
not
used
at
all
some
information
is
also
given
to
help
the
reader
to
connect
words
with
their
roots
and
at
the
same
time
to
caution
him
against
supposing
that
because
he
knows
the
roots
of
a
word
he
necessarily
knows
the
meaning
of
the
word
itself
exercises
are
interspersed
throughout
this
part
which
can
be
worked
out
with
or
without
an
english
etymological
dictionary
as
the
nature
of
the
case
may
require
the
exercises
have
not
been
selected
at
random
many
of
them
have
been
subjected
to
the
practical
test
of
experience
and
have
been
used
in
class
teaching
the
second
part
deals
with
diction
it
attempts
to
illustrate
with
some
detail
the
distinctionoften
ignored
by
those
who
are
beginning
to
write
english
and
sometimes
by
others
alsobetween
the
diction
of
prose
and
that
of
poetry
it
endeavors
to
dissipate
that
excessive
and
vulgar
dread
of
tautology
which
together
with
a
fondness
for
misplaced
pleasantry
gives
rise
to
the
vicious
style
described
above
it
gives
some
practical
rules
for
writing
a
long
sentence
clearly
and
impressively
and
it
also
examines
the
difference
between
slang
conversation
and
written
prose
both
for
translating
from
foreign
languages
into
english
and
for
writing
original
english
composition
these
rules
have
been
used
in
teaching
and
we
venture
to
think
with
encouraging
results
a
chapter
on
simile
and
metaphor
concludes
the
subject
of
diction
we
have
found
in
the
course
of
teaching
that
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
speaking
and
writing
and
still
more
in
reading
and
attempting
to
understand
the
works
of
our
classical
english
authors
arises
from
the
inability
to
express
the
literal
meaning
conveyed
in
a
metaphor
the
application
of
the
principle
of
proportion
to
the
explanation
of
metaphor
has
been
found
to
dissipate
much
of
this
confusion
the
youngest
pupils
readily
learn
how
to
expand
a
metaphor
into
its
simile
and
it
is
really
astonishing
to
see
how
many
difficulties
that
perplex
young
heads
and
sometimes
old
ones
too
vanish
at
once
when
the
key
of
expansion
is
applied
more
important
still
perhaps
is
the
exactness
of
thought
introduced
by
this
method
the
pupil
knows
that
if
he
cannot
expand
a
metaphor
he
does
not
understand
it
all
teachers
will
admit
that
to
force
a
pupil
to
see
that
he
does
not
understand
any
thing
is
a
great
stride
of
progress
it
is
difficult
to
exaggerate
the
value
of
a
process
which
makes
it
impossible
for
a
pupil
to
delude
himself
into
the
belief
that
he
understands
when
he
does
not
understand
metre
is
the
subject
of
the
third
part
the
object
of
this
part
as
also
in
a
great
measure
of
the
chapter
just
mentioned
belonging
to
the
second
part
is
to
enable
the
pupil
to
read
english
poetry
with
intelligence
interest
and
appreciation
to
teach
any
one
how
to
read
a
verse
so
as
to
mark
the
metre
on
the
one
hand
without
on
the
other
hand
converting
the
metrical
line
into
a
monotonous
doggerel
is
not
so
easy
a
task
as
might
be
supposed
many
of
the
rules
stated
in
this
part
have
been
found
of
practical
utility
in
teaching
pupils
to
hit
the
mean
rules
and
illustrations
have
therefore
been
given
and
the
different
kinds
of
metre
and
varieties
of
the
same
metre
have
been
explained
at
considerable
length
this
chapter
may
seem
to
some
to
enter
rather
too
much
into
detail
we
desire
however
to
urge
as
an
explanation
that
in
all
probability
the
study
of
english
metre
will
rapidly
assume
more
importance
in
english
schools
at
present
very
little
is
generally
taught
and
perhaps
known
about
this
subject
in
a
recent
elaborate
edition
of
the
works
of
pope
the
skill
of
that
consummate
master
of
the
art
of
epigrammatic
versification
is
impugned
because
in
one
of
his
lines
he
suffers
the
to
receive
the
metrical
accent
when
one
of
the
commonest
customs
for
it
is
in
no
sense
a
license
of
english
poetsa
custom
sanctioned
by
shakspeare
dryden
milton
wordsworth
byron
shelley
and
tennysoncan
be
censured
as
a
fault
and
this
in
a
leading
edition
of
a
leading
poet
of
our
literature
it
must
be
evident
that
much
still
remains
to
be
done
in
teaching
english
metre
at
present
this
part
may
seem
too
detailed
probably
some
few
years
hence
when
a
knowledge
of
english
metre
has
become
more
widely
diffused
it
will
seem
not
detailed
enough
the
fourth
part
like
the
chapter
on
metaphor
is
concerned
not
more
with
english
than
with
other
languages
it
treats
of
the
different
styles
of
composition
the
appropriate
subjects
for
each
and
the
arrangement
of
the
subjectmatter
we
hope
that
this
may
be
of
some
interest
to
the
general
reader
as
well
as
of
practical
utility
in
the
higher
classes
of
schools
it
seems
desirable
that
before
pupils
begin
to
write
essays
imaginary
dialogues
speeches
and
poems
they
should
receive
some
instruction
as
to
the
difference
of
arrangement
in
a
poem
a
speech
a
conversation
and
an
essay
an
appendix
adds
a
few
hints
on
some
errors
in
reasoning
this
addition
may
interfere
with
the
symmetry
of
the
book
but
if
it
is
found
of
use
the
utility
will
be
ample
compensation
in
reading
literature
pupils
are
continually
meeting
instances
of
false
reasoning
which
if
passed
over
without
comment
do
harm
and
if
commented
upon
require
some
little
basis
of
knowledge
in
the
pupil
to
enable
him
to
understand
the
explanation
without
entering
into
the
details
of
formal
logic
we
have
found
it
possible
to
give
pupils
some
few
hints
which
have
appeared
to
help
them
the
hints
are
so
elementary
and
so
few
that
they
cannot
possibly
delude
the
youngest
reader
into
imagining
that
they
are
any
thing
more
than
hints
they
may
induce
him
hereafter
to
study
the
subject
thoroughly
in
a
complete
treatise
when
he
has
leisure
and
opportunity
but
in
any
case
a
boy
will
leave
school
all
the
better
prepared
for
the
work
of
life
whatever
that
work
may
be
if
he
knows
the
meaning
of
induction
and
has
been
cautioned
against
the
error
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
no
lesson
so
far
as
our
experience
in
teaching
goes
interests
and
stimulates
pupils
more
than
this
and
our
experience
of
debating
societies
in
the
higher
forms
of
schools
forces
upon
us
the
conviction
that
such
lessons
are
not
more
interesting
than
necessary
questions
on
the
different
paragraphs
have
been
added
at
the
end
of
the
book
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
student
to
test
his
knowledge
of
the
contents
and
also
to
serve
as
home
lessons
to
be
prepared
by
pupils
in
classes
a
desire
expressed
by
some
teachers
of
experience
that
these
lessons
should
be
published
as
soon
as
possible
has
rather
accelerated
the
publication
some
misprints
and
other
inaccuracies
may
possibly
be
found
in
the
following
pages
in
consequence
of
the
short
time
which
has
been
allowed
us
for
correcting
them
our
thanks
are
due
to
several
friends
who
have
kindly
assisted
us
in
this
task

have
also

in

we
entertain
a
hope
that
it
may

not

by
the
steamboat
from
rotterdam
on
their
return
from
an
excursion
to
the
rhine
have
often
their
attention
strongly
attracted
by
what
appears
to
be
a
splendid
palace
on
the
banks
of
the
river
at
greenwich
the
edifice
is
not
a
palace
however
but
a
hospital
or
rather
a
retreat
where
the
worn
out
maimed
and
crippled
veterans
of
the
english
navy
spend
the
remnant
of
their
days
in
comfort
and
peace
on
pensions
allowed
them
by
the
government
in
whose
service
they
have
spent
their
strength
or
lost
their
limbs
the
magnificent
buildings
of
the
hospital
stand
on
level
land
near
the
river
behind
them
there
is
a
beautiful
park
which
extends
over
the
undulating
and
rising
ground
in
the
rear
and
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
eminences
there
is
the
famous
greenwich
observatory
on
the
precision
of
whose
quadrants
and
micrometers
depend
those
calculations
by
which
the
navigation
of
the
world
is
guided
the
most
unconcerned
and
careless
spectator
is
interested
in
the
manner
in
which
the
ships
which
throng
the
river
all
the
way
from
greenwich
to
london
take
their
time
from
this
observatory
before
setting
sail
for
distant
seas
from
the
top
of
a
cupola
surmounting
the
edifice
a
slender
pole
ascends
with
a
black
ball
upon
it
so
constructed
as
to
slide
up
and
down
for
a
few
feet
upon
the
pole
when
the
hour
of
m
approaches
the
ball
slowly
rises
to
within
a
few
inches
of
the
top
warning
the
shipmasters
in
the
river
to
be
ready
with
their
chronometers
to
observe
and
note
the
precise
instant
of
its
fall
when
a
few
seconds
only
remain
of
the
time
the
ball
ascends
the
remainder
of
the
distance
by
a
very
deliberate
motion
and
then
drops
suddenly
when
the
instant
arrives
the
ships
depart
on
their
several
destinations
and
for
months
afterward
when
thousands
of
miles
away
they
depend
for
their
safety
in
dark
and
stormy
nights
and
among
dangerous
reefs
and
rocky
shores
on
the
nice
approximation
to
correctness
in
the
note
of
time
which
this
descending
ball
had
given
them
illustration
portrait
of
henry
viii
this
is
greenwich
as
it
exists
at
the
present
day
at
the
time
when
the
events
occurred
which
are
to
be
related
in
this
narrative
it
was
most
known
on
account
of
a
royal
palace
which
was
situated
there
this
palace
was
the
residence
of
the
then
queen
consort
of
england
the
king
reigning
at
that
time
was
henry
the
eighth
he
was
an
unprincipled
and
cruel
tyrant
and
the
chief
business
of
his
life
seemed
to
be
selecting
and
marrying
new
queens
making
room
for
each
succeeding
one
by
discarding
divorcing
or
beheading
her
predecessor
there
were
six
of
them
in
all
and
with
one
exception
the
history
of
each
one
is
a
distinct
and
separate
but
dreadful
tragedy
as
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
they
figured
as
queens
each
for
so
short
a
period
they
are
commonly
designated
in
history
by
their
personal
family
names
and
even
in
these
names
there
is
a
great
similarity
there
were
three
catharines
two
annes
and
a
jane
the
only
one
who
lived
and
died
in
peace
respected
and
beloved
to
the
end
was
the
jane
illustration
portrait
of
anne
boleyn
queen
elizabeth
the
subject
of
this
narrative
was
the
daughter
of
the
second
wife
in
this
strange
succession
and
her
mother
was
one
of
the
annes
her
name
in
full
was
anne
boleyn
she
was
young
and
very
beautiful
and
henry
to
prepare
the
way
for
making
her
his
wife
divorced
his
first
queen
or
rather
declared
his
marriage
with
her
null
and
void
because
she
had
been
before
he
married
her
the
wife
of
his
brother
her
name
was
catharine
of
aragon
she
was
while
connected
with
him
a
faithful
true
and
affectionate
wife
she
was
a
catholic
the
catholic
rules
are
very
strict
in
respect
to
the
marriage
of
relatives
and
a
special
dispensation
from
the
pope
was
necessary
to
authorize
marriage
in
such
a
case
as
that
of
henry
and
catharine
this
dispensation
had
however
been
obtained
and
catharine
had
in
reliance
upon
it
consented
to
become
henrys
wife
when
however
she
was
no
longer
young
and
beautiful
and
henry
had
become
enamored
of
anne
boleyn
who
was
so
he
discarded
catharine
and
espoused
the
beautiful
girl
in
her
stead
he
wished
the
pope
to
annul
his
dispensation
which
would
of
course
annul
the
marriage
and
because
the
pontiff
refused
and
all
the
efforts
of
henrys
government
were
unavailing
to
move
him
he
abandoned
the
catholic
faith
and
established
an
independent
protestant
church
in
england
whose
supreme
authority
would
annul
the
marriage
thus
in
a
great
measure
came
the
reformation
in
england
the
catholics
reproach
us
and
it
must
be
confessed
with
some
justice
with
the
ignominiousness
of
its
origin
the
course
which
things
thus
took
created
a
great
deal
of
delay
in
the
formal
annulling
of
the
marriage
with
catharine
which
henry
was
too
impatient
and
imperious
to
bear
he
would
not
wait
for
the
decree
of
divorce
but
took
anne
boleyn
for
his
wife
before
his
previous
connection
was
made
void
he
said
he
was
privately
married
to
her
this
he
had
as
he
maintained
a
right
to
do
for
he
considered
his
first
marriage
as
void
absolutely
and
of
itself
without
any
decree
when
at
length
the
decree
was
finally
passed
he
brought
anne
boleyn
forward
as
his
queen
and
introduced
her
as
such
to
england
and
to
the
world
by
a
genuine
marriage
and
a
most
magnificent
coronation
the
people
of
england
pitied
poor
catharine
but
they
joined
very
cordially
notwithstanding
in
welcoming
the
youthful
and
beautiful
lady
who
was
to
take
her
place
all
london
gave
itself
up
to
festivities
and
rejoicings
on
the
occasion
of
these
nuptials
immediately
after
this
the
young
queen
retired
to
her
palace
in
greenwich
and
in
two
or
three
months
afterward
little
elizabeth
was
born
her
birthday
was
the
th
of
september
the
mother
may
have
loved
the
babe
but
henry
himself
was
sadly
disappointed
that
his
child
was
not
a
son
notwithstanding
her
sex
however
she
was
a
personage
of
great
distinction
from
her
very
birth
as
all
the
realm
looked
upon
her
as
heir
to
the
crown
henry
was
himself
at
this
time
very
fond
of
anne
boleyn
though
his
feelings
afterward
were
entirely
changed
he
determined
on
giving
to
the
infant
a
very
splendid
christening
the
usage
in
the
church
of
england
is
to
make
the
christening
of
a
child
not
merely
a
solemn
religious
ceremony
but
a
great
festive
occasion
of
congratulations
and
rejoicing
the
unconscious
subject
of
the
ceremony
is
taken
to
the
church
certain
near
and
distinguished
friends
gentlemen
and
ladies
appear
as
godfathers
and
godmothers
as
they
are
termed
to
the
child
they
in
the
ceremony
are
considered
as
presenting
the
infant
for
consecration
to
christ
and
as
becoming
responsible
for
its
future
initiation
into
the
christian
faith
they
are
hence
sometimes
called
sponsors
these
sponsors
are
supposed
to
take
from
the
time
of
the
baptism
forward
a
strong
interest
in
all
that
pertains
to
the
welfare
of
their
little
charge
and
they
usually
manifest
this
interest
by
presents
on
the
day
of
the
christening
these
things
are
all
conducted
with
considerable
ceremony
and
parade
in
ordinary
cases
occurring
in
private
life
and
when
a
princess
is
to
be
baptized
all
even
the
most
minute
details
of
the
ceremony
assume
a
great
importance
and
the
whole
scene
becomes
one
of
great
pomp
and
splendor
the
babe
in
this
case
was
conveyed
to
the
church
in
a
grand
procession
the
mayor
and
other
civic
authorities
in
london
came
down
to
greenwich
in
barges
tastefully
ornamented
to
join
in
the
ceremony
the
lords
and
ladies
of
king
henrys
court
were
also
there
in
attendance
at
the
palace
when
all
were
assembled
and
every
thing
was
ready
the
procession
moved
from
the
palace
to
the
church
with
great
pomp
the
road
all
the
way
was
carpeted
with
green
rushes
spread
upon
the
ground
over
this
road
the
little
infant
was
borne
by
one
of
her
godmothers
she
was
wrapped
in
a
mantle
of
purple
velvet
with
a
long
train
appended
to
it
which
was
trimmed
with
ermine
a
very
costly
kind
of
fur
used
in
england
as
a
badge
of
authority
this
train
was
borne
by
lords
and
ladies
of
high
rank
who
were
appointed
for
the
purpose
by
the
king
and
who
deemed
their
office
a
very
distinguished
honor
besides
these
trainbearers
there
were
four
lords
who
walked
two
on
each
side
of
the
child
and
who
held
over
her
a
magnificent
canopy
other
personages
of
high
rank
and
station
followed
bearing
various
insignia
and
emblems
such
as
by
the
ancient
customs
of
england
are
employed
on
these
occasions
and
all
dressed
sumptuously
in
gorgeous
robes
and
wearing
the
badges
and
decorations
pertaining
to
their
rank
or
the
offices
they
held
vast
crowds
of
spectators
lined
the
way
and
gazed
upon
the
scene
illustration
the
christening
gifts
on
arriving
at
the
church
they
found
the
interior
splendidly
decorated
for
the
occasion
its
walls
were
lined
throughout
with
tapestry
and
in
the
center
was
a
crimson
canopy
under
which
was
placed
a
large
silver
font
containing
the
water
with
which
the
child
was
to
be
baptized
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
cranmer
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
which
is
the
office
of
the
highest
dignitary
of
the
english
church
after
it
was
performed
the
procession
returned
as
it
came
only
now
there
was
an
addition
of
four
persons
of
high
rank
who
followed
the
child
with
the
presents
intended
for
her
by
the
godfathers
and
godmothers
these
presents
consisted
of
cups
and
bowls
of
beautiful
workmanship
some
of
silver
gilt
and
some
of
solid
gold
they
were
very
costly
though
not
prized
much
yet
by
the
unconscious
infant
for
whom
they
were
intended
she
went
and
came
in
the
midst
of
this
gay
and
joyous
procession
little
imagining
into
what
a
restless
and
unsatisfying
life
all
this
pageantry
and
splendor
were
ushering
her
they
named
the
child
elizabeth
from
her
grandmother
there
have
been
many
queens
of
that
name
but
queen
elizabeth
of
england
became
so
much
more
distinguished
than
any
other
that
that
name
alone
has
become
her
usual
designation
her
family
name
was
tudor
as
she
was
never
marriedfor
though
her
life
was
one
perpetual
scene
of
matrimonial
schemes
and
negotiations
she
lived
and
died
a
maiden
ladyshe
has
been
sometimes
called
the
virgin
queen
and
one
of
the
states
of
this
union
virginia
receives
its
name
from
this
designation
of
elizabeth
she
is
also
often
familiarly
called
queen
bess
making
little
elizabeth
presents
of
gold
and
silver
plate
and
arranging
splendid
pageants
for
her
were
not
the
only
plans
for
her
aggrandizement
which
were
formed
during
the
period
of
her
infantile
unconsciousness
the
king
her
father
first
had
an
act
of
parliament
passed
solemnly
recognizing
and
confirming
her
claim
as
heir
to
the
crown
and
the
title
of
princess
of
wales
was
formally
conferred
upon
her
when
these
things
were
done
henry
began
to
consider
how
he
could
best
promote
his
own
political
schemes
by
forming
an
engagement
of
marriage
for
her
and
when
she
was
only
about
two
years
of
age
he
offered
her
to
the
king
of
france
as
the
future
wife
of
one
of
his
sons
on
certain
conditions
of
political
service
which
he
wished
him
to
perform
but
the
king
of
france
would
not
accede
to
the
terms
and
so
this
plan
was
abandoned
elizabeth
was
however
notwithstanding
this
failure
an
object
of
universal
interest
and
attention
as
the
daughter
of
a
very
powerful
monarch
and
the
heir
to
his
crown
her
life
opened
with
very
bright
and
serene
prospects
of
future
greatness
but
all
these
prospects
were
soon
apparently
cut
off
by
a
very
heavy
cloud
which
arose
to
darken
her
sky
this
cloud
was
the
sudden
and
dreadful
fall
and
ruin
of
her
mother
queen
anne
boleyn
was
originally
a
maid
of
honor
to
queen
catharine
and
became
acquainted
with
king
henry
and
gained
his
affections
while
she
was
acting
in
that
capacity
when
she
became
queen
herself
she
had
of
course
her
own
maids
of
honor
and
among
them
was
one
named
jane
seymour
jane
was
a
beautiful
and
accomplished
lady
and
in
the
end
she
supplanted
her
mistress
and
queen
in
henrys
affections
just
as
anne
herself
had
supplanted
catharine
the
king
had
removed
catharine
to
make
way
for
anne
by
annulling
his
marriage
with
her
on
account
of
their
relationship
what
way
could
he
contrive
now
to
remove
anne
so
as
to
make
way
for
jane
he
began
to
entertain
or
to
pretend
to
entertain
feelings
of
jealousy
and
suspicion
that
anne
was
unfaithful
to
him
one
day
at
a
sort
of
tournament
in
the
park
of
the
royal
palace
at
greenwich
when
a
great
crowd
of
gaylydressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
assembled
to
witness
the
spectacle
the
queen
dropped
her
handkerchief
a
gentleman
whom
the
king
had
suspected
of
being
one
of
her
favorites
picked
it
up
he
did
not
immediately
restore
it
to
her
there
was
besides
something
in
the
air
and
manner
of
the
gentleman
and
in
the
attendant
circumstances
of
the
case
which
the
kings
mind
seized
upon
as
evidence
of
criminal
gallantry
between
the
parties
he
was
or
at
least
pretended
to
be
in
a
great
rage
he
left
the
field
immediately
and
went
to
london
the
tournament
was
broken
up
in
confusion
the
queen
was
seized
by
the
kings
orders
conveyed
to
her
palace
in
greenwich
and
shut
up
in
her
chamber
with
a
lady
who
had
always
been
her
rival
and
enemy
to
guard
her
she
was
in
great
consternation
and
sorrow
but
she
declared
most
solemnly
that
she
was
innocent
of
any
crime
and
had
always
been
true
and
faithful
to
the
king
illustration
the
tower
of
london
the
next
day
she
was
taken
from
her
palace
at
greenwich
up
the
river
probably
in
a
barge
well
guarded
by
armed
men
to
the
tower
of
london
the
tower
is
an
ancient
and
very
extensive
castle
consisting
of
a
great
number
of
buildings
inclosed
within
a
high
wall
it
is
in
the
lower
part
of
london
on
the
bank
of
the
thames
with
a
flight
of
stairs
leading
down
to
the
river
from
a
great
postern
gate
the
unhappy
queen
was
landed
at
these
stairs
and
conveyed
into
the
castle
and
shut
up
in
a
gloomy
apartment
with
walls
of
stone
and
windows
barricaded
with
strong
bars
of
iron
there
were
four
or
five
gentlemen
attendants
upon
the
queen

palace
at
greenwich
whom
the
king
suspected

pretended
to
suspect
of
being
her
accomplices

crime

were
arrested
at
the
same
time
with
her
and
closely
confined
when
the
poor
queen
was
introduced
into
her
dungeon
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
in
an
agony
of
terror
and
despair
she
implored
god
to
help
her
in
this
hour
of
her
extremity
and
most
solemnly
called
him
to
witness
that
she
was
innocent
of
the
crime
imputed
to
her
charge
seeking
thus
a
refuge

calmed
and
composed
her
in
some
small
degree
but
when
again
thoughts
of
the
imperious
and
implacable
temper
of
her
husband
came
over
her
of
the
impetuousness
of
his
passions
of
the
certainty
that
he
wished
her
removed
out
of
the
way
in
order
that
room
might
be
made
for
her
rival
and
then
when
her
distracted
mind
turned
to
the
forlorn
and
helpless
condition
of
her
little
daughter
elizabeth
now
scarcely
three
years
old
her
fortitude
and
selfpossession
forsook
her
entirely
she
sank
half
insane
upon
her
bed
in
long
and
uncontrollable
paroxysms
of
sobs
and
tears
alternating
with
still
more
uncontrollable
and
frightful
bursts
of
hysterical
laughter
the
king
sent
a
commission
to
take
her
examination
at
the

time
he
urged
her
by
the
persons
whom
he
sent
to
confess
her
guilt
promising
her
that
if
she
did
so
her
life
should
be
spared
she
however
protested
her
innocence
with
the
utmost
firmness
and
constancy
she
begged
earnestly
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
king
and
when
this
was
refused
she
wrote
a
letter
to
him
which
still
remains
and
which
expresses
very
strongly
the
acuteness
of
her
mental
sufferings
in
this
letter
she
said
that
she
was
so
distressed
and
bewildered
by
the
kings
displeasure
and
her
imprisonment
that
she
hardly
knew
what
to
think
or
to
say
she
assured
him
that
she
had
always
been
faithful
and
true
to
him
and
begged
that
he
would
not
cast
an
indelible
stain
upon
her
own
fair
fame
and
that
of
her
innocent
and
helpless
child
by
such
unjust
and
groundless
imputations
she
begged
him
to
let
her
have
a
fair
trial
by
impartial
persons
who
would
weigh
the
evidence
against
her
in
a
just
and
equitable
manner
she
was
sure
that
by
this
course
her
innocence
would
be
established
and
he
himself
and
all
mankind
would
see
that
she
had
been
most
unjustly
accused
but
if
on
the
other
hand
she
added
the
king
had
determined
on
her
destruction
in
order
to
remove
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
possession
of
a
new
object
of
love
she
prayed
that
god
would
forgive
him
and
all
her
enemies
for
so
great
a
sin
and
not
call
him
to
account
for
it
at
the
last
day
she
urged
him
at
all
events
to
spare
the
lives
of
the
four
gentlemen
who
had
been
accused
as
she
assured
him
they
were
wholly
innocent
of
the
crime
laid
to
their
charge
begging
him
if
he
had
ever
loved
the
name
of
anne
boleyn
to
grant
this
her
last
request
she
signed
her
letter
his
most
loyal
and
ever
faithful
wife
and
dated
it
from
her
doleful
prison
in
the
tower
the
four
gentlemen
were
promised
that
their
lives
should
be
spared
if
they
would
confess
their
guilt
one
of
them
did
accordingly
admit
his
guilt
and
the
others
persisted
to
the
end
in
firmly
denying
it
they
who
think
anne
boleyn
was
innocent
suppose
that
the
one
who
confessed
did
it
as
the
most
likely
mode
of
averting
destruction
as
men
have
often
been
known
under
the
influence
of
fear
to
confess
crimes
of
which
it
was
afterward
proved
they
could
not
have
been
guilty
if
this
was
his
motive
it
was
of
no
avail
the
four
persons
accused
after
a
very
informal
trial
in
which
nothing
was
really
proved
against
them
were
condemned
apparently
to
please
the
king
and
were
executed
together
three
days
after
this
the
queen
herself
was
brought
to
trial
before
the
peers
the
number
of
peers
of
the
realm
in
england
at
this
time
was
fiftythree
only
twentysix
were
present
at
the
trial
the
king
is
charged
with
making
such
arrangements
as
to
prevent
the
attendance
of
those
who
would
be
unwilling
to
pass
sentence
of
condemnation
at
any
rate
those
who
did
attend
professed
to
be
satisfied
of
the
guilt
of
the
accused
and
they
sentenced
her
to
be
burned
or
to
be
beheaded
at
the
pleasure
of
the
king
he
decided
that
she
should
be
beheaded
the
execution
was
to
take
place
in
a
little
green
area
within
the
tower
the
platform
was
erected
here
and
the
block
placed
upon
it
the
whole
being
covered
with
a
black
cloth
as
usual
on
such
occasions
on
the
morning
of
the
fatal
day
anne
sent
for
the
constable
of
the
tower
to
come
in
and
receive
her
dying
protestations
that
she
was
innocent
of
the
crimes
alleged
against
her
she
told
him
that
she
understood
that
she
was
not
to
die
until
oclock
and
that
she
was
sorry
for
it
for
she
wished
to
have
it
over
the
constable
told
her
the
pain
would
be
very
slight
and
momentary
yes
she
rejoined
i
am
told
that
a
very
skillful
executioner
is
provided
and
my
neck
is
very
slender
at
the
appointed
hour
she
was
led
out
into
the
courtyard
where
the
execution
was
to
take
place
there
were
about
twenty
persons
present
all
officers
of
state
or
of
the
city
of
london
the
bodily
suffering
attendant
upon
the
execution
was
very
soon
over
for
the
slender
neck
was
severed
at
a
single
blow
and
probably
all
sensibility
to
pain
immediately
ceased
still
the
lips
and
the
eyes
were
observed
to
move
and
quiver
for
a
few
seconds
after
the
separation
of
the
head
from
the
body
it
was
a
relief
however
to
the
spectators
when
this
strange
and
unnatural
prolongation
of
the
mysterious
functions
of
life
came
to
an
end
no
coffin
had
been
provided
they
found
however
an
old
wooden
chest
made
to
contain
arrows
lying
in
one
of
the
apartments
of
the
tower
which
they
used
instead
they
first
laid
the
decapitated
trunk
within
it
and
then
adjusted
the
dissevered
head
to
its
place
as
if
vainly
attempting
to
repair
the
irretrievable
injury
they
had
done
they
hurried
the
body
thus
enshrined
to
its
burial
in
a
chapel
which
was
also
within
the
tower
doing
all
with
such
dispatch
that
the
whole
was
finished
before
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
the
next
day
the
unfeeling
monster
who
was
the
author
of
this
dreadful
deed
was
publicly
married
to
his
new
favorite
jane
seymour
the
king
had
not
merely
procured
annes
personal
condemnation
he
had
also
obtained
a
decree
annulling
his
marriage
with
her
on
the
ground
of
her
having
been
as
he
attempted
to
prove
previously
affianced
to
another
man
this
was
obviously
a
mere
pretense
the
object
was
to
cut
off
elizabeths
rights
to
inherit
the
crown
by
making
his
marriage
with
her
mother
void
thus
was
the
little
princess
left
motherless
and
friendless

elizabeth
was
about
three
years
old
at
the
death
of
her
mother
she
was
a
princess
but
she
was
left
in
a
very
forlorn
and
desolate
condition
she
was
not
however
entirely
abandoned
her
claims
to
inherit
the
crown
had
been
set
aside
but
then
she
was
as
all
admitted
the
daughter
of
the
king
and
she
must
of
course
be
the
object
of
a
certain
degree
of
consideration
and
ceremony
it
would
be
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
notions
of
royal
dignity
which
then
prevailed
to
have
her
treated
like
an
ordinary
child
she
had
a
residence
assigned
her
at
a
place
called
hunsdon
and
was
put
under
the
charge
of
a
governess
whose
name
was
lady
bryan
there
is
an
ancient
letter
from
lady
bryan
still
extant
which
was
written
to
one
of
the
kings
officers
about
elizabeth
explaining
her
destitute
condition
and
asking
for
a
more
suitable
supply
for
her
wants
it
may
entertain
the
reader
to
see
this
relic
which
not
only
illustrates
our
little
heroines
condition
but
also
shows
how
great
the
changes
are
which
our
language
has
undergone
within
the
last
three
hundred
years
the
letter
as
here
given
is
abridged
a
little
from
the
original
my
lord
when
your
lordship
was
last
here
it
pleased
you
to
say
that
i
should
not
be
mistrustful
of
the
kings
grace
nor
of
your
lordship
which
word
was
of
great
comfort
to
me
and
emboldeneth
me
now
to
speak
my
poor
mind
now
so
it
is
my
lord
that
my
lady
elizabeth
is
put
from
the
degree
she
was
afore
and
what
degree
she
is
at
nowa
i
know
not
but
by
hearsay
therefore
i
know
not
how
to
order
her
nor
myself
nor
none
of
hers
that
i
have
the
rule
ofthat
is
her
women
and
her
grooms
but
i
beseech
you
to
be
good
my
lord
to
her
and
to
all
hers
and
to
let
her
have
some
rayment
for
she
has
neither
gown
nor
kirtle
nor
no
manner
of
linen
nor
foresmocks
nor
kerchiefs
nor
sleeves
nor
rails
nor
bodystitchets
nor
mufflers
nor
biggins
all
these
her
graces
wants
i
have
driven
off
as
long
as
i
can
by
my
troth
but
i
can
not
any
longer
beseeching
you
my
lord
that
you
will
see
that
her
grace
may
have
that
is
needful
for
her
and
that
i
may
know
from
you
in
writing
how
i
shall
order
myself
towards
her
and
whatever
is
the
kings
graces
pleasure
and
yours
in
every
thing
that
i
shall
do
footnote
a
that
is
in
what
light
the
king
and
the
government
wish
to
have
her
regarded
and
how
they
wish
her
to
be
treated
my
lord
mr
shelton
would
have
my
lady
elizabeth
to
dine
and
sup
at
the
board
of
estate
alas
my
lord
it
is
not
meet
for
a
child
of
her
age
to
keep
such
rule
yet
i
promise
you
my
lord
i
dare
not
take
upon
me
to
keep
her
in
health
and
she
keep
that
rule
for
there
she
shall
see
divers
meats
and
fruits
and
wines
which
would
be
hard
for
me
to
restrain
her
grace
from
it
you
know
my
lord
there
is
no
place
of
correctionb
there
and
she
is
yet
too
young
to
correct
greatly
i
know
well
and
she
be
there
i
shall
never
bring
her
up
to
the
kings
graces
honor
nor
hers
nor
to
her
health
nor
my
poor
honesty
wherefore
i
beseech
you
my
lord
that
my
lady
may
have
a
mess
of
meat
to
her
own
lodging
with
a
good
dish
or
two
that
is
meet
for
her
grace
to
eat
of
footnote
b
that
is
opportunity
for
correction
my
lady
hath
likewise
great
pain
with
her
teeth
and
they
come
very
slowly
forth
and
this
causeth
me
to
suffer
her
grace
to
have
her
will
more
than
i
would
i
trust
to
god
and
her
teeth
were
well
graft
to
have
her
grace
after
another
fashion
than
she
is
yet
so
as
i
trust
the
kings
grace
shall
have
great
comfort
in
her
grace
for
she
is
as
toward
a
child
and
as
gentle
of
conditions
as
ever
i
knew
any
in
my
life
jesu
preserve
her
grace
good
my
lord
have
my
ladys
grace
and
us
that
be
her
poor
servants
in
your
remembrance
this
letter
evinces
that
strange
mixture
of
state
and
splendor
with
discomfort
and
destitution
which
prevailed
very
extensively
in
royal
households
in
those
early
times
a
part
of
the
privation
which
elizabeth
seems
from
this
letter
to
have
endured
was
doubtless
owing
to
the
rough
manners
of
the
day
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
was
also
at
least
for
a
time
in
a
neglected
and
forsaken
condition
the
new
queen
jane
seymour
who
succeeded
elizabeths
mother
had
a
son
a
year
or
two
after
her
marriage
he
was
named
edward
thus
henry
had
three
children
mary
elizabeth
and
edward
each
one
the
child
of
a
different
wife
and
the
last
of
them
the
son
appears
to
have
monopolized
for
a
time
the
kings
affection
and
care
still
the
hostility
which
the
king
had
felt
for
these
queens
in
succession
was
owing
as
has
been
already
said
to
his
desire
to
remove
them
out
of
his
way
that
he
might
be
at
liberty
to
marry
again
and
so
after
the
mothers
were
one
after
another
removed
the
hostility
itself
so
far
as
the
children
were
concerned
gradually
subsided
and
the
king
began
to
look
both
upon
mary
and
elizabeth
with
favor
again
he
even
formed
plans
for
marrying
elizabeth
to
persons
of
distinction
in
foreign
countries
and
he
entered
into
some
negotiations
for
this
purpose
he
had
a
decree
passed
too
at
last
reversing
the
sentence
by
which
the
two
princesses
were
cut
off
from
an
inheritance
of
the
crown
thus
they
were
restored
during
their
fathers
life
to
their
proper
rank
as
royal
princesses
illustration
portrait
of
edward
vi
at
last
the
king
died
in
leaving
only
these
three
children
each
one
the
child
of
a
different
wife
mary
was
a
maiden
lady
of
about
thirtyone
years
of
age
she
was
a
stern
austere
hardhearted
woman
whom
nobody
loved
she
was
the
daughter
of
king
henrys
first
wife
catharine
of
aragon
and
like
her
mother
was
a
decided
catholic
next
came
elizabeth
who
was
about
fourteen
years
of
age
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
kings
second
wife
queen
anne
boleyn
she
had
been
educated
a
protestant
she
was
not
pretty
but
was
a
very
lively
and
sprightly
child
altogether
different
in
her
cast
of
character
and
in
her
manners
from
her
sister
mary
then
lastly
there
was
edward
the
son
of
jane
seymour
the
third
queen
he
was
about
nine
years
of
age
at
his
fathers
death
he
was
a
boy
of
good
character
mild
and
gentle
in
his
disposition
fond
of
study
and
reflection
and
a
general
favorite
with
all
who
knew
him
it
was
considered
in
those
days
that
a
king
might
in
some
sense
dispose
of
his
crown
by
will
just
as
at
the
present
time
a
man
may
bequeath
his
house
or
his
farm
of
course
there
were
some
limits
to
this
power
and
the
concurrence
of
parliament
seems
to
have
been
required
to
the
complete
validity
of
such
a
settlement
king
henry
the
eighth
however
had
little
difficulty
in
carrying
any
law
through
parliament
which
he
desired
to
have
enacted
it
is
said
that
on
one
occasion
when
there
was
some
delay
about
passing
a
bill
of
his
he
sent
for
one
of
the
most
influential
of
the
members
of
the
house
of
commons
to
come
into
his
presence
the
member
came
and
kneeled
before
him
ho
man
said
the
king
and
will
they
not
suffer
my
bill
to
pass
he
then
came
up
and
put
his
hand
upon
the
kneeling
legislators
head
and
added
get
my
bill
passed
tomorrow
or
else
by
tomorrow
this
head
of
yours
shall
be
off
the
next
day
the
bill
was
passed
accordingly
king
henry
before
he
died
arranged
the
order
of
succession
to
the
throne
as
follows
edward
was
to
succeed
him
but
as
he
was
a
minor
being
then
only
nine
years
of
age
a
great
council
of
state
consisting
of
sixteen
persons
of
the
highest
rank
was
appointed
to
govern
the
kingdom
in
his
name
until
he
should
be
eighteen
years
of
age
when
he
was
to
become
king
in
reality
as
well
as
in
name
in
case
he
should
die
without
heirs
then
mary
his
oldest
sister
was
to
succeed
him
and
if
she
died
without
heirs
then
elizabeth
was
to
succeed
her
this
arrangement
went
into
full
effect
the
council
governed
the
kingdom
in
edwards
name
until
he
was
sixteen
years
of
age
when
he
died
then
mary
followed
and
reigned
as
queen
five
years
longer
and
died
without
children
and
during
all
this
time
elizabeth
held
the
rank
of
a
princess
exposed
to
a
thousand
difficulties
and
dangers
from
the
plots
intrigues
and
conspiracies
of
those
about
her
in
which
on
account
of
her
peculiar
position
and
prospects
she
was
necessarily
involved
one
of
the
worst
of
these
cases
occurred
soon
after
her
fathers
death
there
were
two
brothers
of
jane
seymour
who
were
high
in
king
henrys
favor
at
the
time
of
his
decease
the
oldest
is
known
in
history
by
his
title
of
the
earl
of
hertford
at
first
and
afterward
by
that
of
duke
of
somerset
the
youngest
was
called
sir
thomas
seymour
they
were
both
made
members
of
the
government
which
was
to
administer
the
affairs
of
state
during
young
edwards
minority
they
were
not
however
satisfied
with
any
moderate
degree
of
power
being
brothers
of
jane
seymour
who
was
edwards
mother
they
were
his
uncles
of
course
and
the
oldest
one
soon
succeeded
in
causing
himself
to
be
appointed
protector
by
this
office
he
was
in
fact
king
all
except
in
name
the
younger
brother
who
was
an
agreeable
and
accomplished
man
paid
his
addresses
to
the
queen
dowager
that
is
to
the
widow
whom
king
henry
left
for
the
last
of
his
wives
was
living
at
the
time
of
his
death
she
consented
to
marry
him
and
the
marriage
took
place
almost
immediately
after
the
kings
deathso
soon
in
fact
that
it
was
considered
extremely
hasty
and
unbecoming
this
queen
dowager
had
two
houses
left
to
her
one
at
chelsea
and
the
other
at
hanworth
towns
some
little
distance
up
the
river
from
london
here
she
resided
with
her
new
husband
sometimes
at
one
of
the
houses
and
sometimes
at
the
other
the
king
had
also
directed
in
his
will
that
the
princess
elizabeth
should
be
under
her
care
so
that
elizabeth
immediately
after
her
fathers
death
lived
at
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
houses
under
the
care
of
seymour
who
from
having
been
her
uncle
became
now
in
some
sense
her
father
he
was
a
sort
of
uncle
for
he
was
the
brother
of
one
of
her
fathers
wives
he
was
a
sort
of
father
for
he
was
the
husband
of
another
of
them
yet
really
by
blood
there
was
no
relation
between
them
the
two
brothers
somerset
and
seymour
quarreled
each
was
very
ambitious
and
very
jealous
of
the
other
somerset
in
addition
to
being
appointed
protector
by
the
council
got
a
grant
of
power
from
the
young
king
called
a
patent
this
commission
was
executed
with
great
formality
and
was
sealed
with
the
great
seal
of
state
and
it
made
somerset
in
some
measure
independent
of
the
other
nobles
whom
king
henry
had
associated
with
him
in
the
government
by
this
patent
he
was
placed
in
supreme
command
of
all
the
forces
by
land
and
sea
he
had
a
seat
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
under
the
great
canopy
of
state
and
whenever
he
went
abroad
on
public
occasions
he
assumed
all
the
pomp
and
parade
which
would
have
been
expected
in
a
real
king
young
edward
was
wholly
under
his
influence
and
did
always
whatever
somerset
recommended
him
to
do
seymour
was
very
jealous
of
all
this
greatness
and
was
contriving
every
means
in
his
power
to
circumvent
and
supersede
his
brother
the
wives
too
of
these
great
statesmen
quarreled
the
duchess
of
somerset
thought
she
was
entitled
to
the
precedence
because
she
was
the
wife
of
the
protector
who
being
a
kind
of
regent
she
thought
he
was
entitled
to
have
his
wife
considered
as
a
sort
of
queen
the
wife
of
seymour
on
the
other
hand
contended
that
she
was
entitled
to
the
precedence
as
a
real
queen
having
been
herself
the
actual
consort
of
a
reigning
monarch
the
two
ladies
disputed
perpetually
on
this
point
which
of
course
could
never
be
settled
they
enlisted
however
on
their
respective
sides
various
partisans
producing
a
great
deal
of
jealousy
and
ill
will
and
increasing
the
animosity
of
their
husbands
all
this
time
the
celebrated
mary
queen
of
scots
was
an
infant
in
janet
sinclairs
arms
at
the
castle
of
stirling
in
scotland
king
henry
during
his
life
had
made
a
treaty
with
the
government
of
scotland
by
which
it
was
agreed
that
mary
should
be
married
to
his
son
edward
as
soon
as
the
two
children
should
have
grown
to
maturity
but
afterward
the
government
of
scotland
having
fallen
from
protestant
into
catholic
hands
they
determined
that
this
match
must
be
given
up
the
english
authorities
were
very
much
incensed
they
wished
to
have
the
marriage
take
effect
as
it
would
end
in
uniting
the
scotch
and
english
kingdoms
and
the
protector
when
a
time
arrived
which
he
thought
was
favorable
for
his
purpose
raised
an
army
and
marched
northward
to
make
war
upon
scotland
and
compel
the
scots
to
fulfill
the
contract
of
marriage
while
his
brother
was
gone
to
the
northward
seymour
remained
at
home
and
endeavored
by
every
means
within
his
reach
to
strengthen
his
own
influence
and
increase
his
power
he
contrived
to
obtain
from
the
council
of
government
the
office
of
lord
high
admiral
which
gave
him
the
command
of
the
fleet
and
made
him
next
to
his
brother
the
most
powerful
and
important
personage
in
the
realm
he
had
besides
as
has
already
been
stated
the
custody
and
care
of
elizabeth
who
lived
in
his
house
though
as
he
was
a
profligate
and
unprincipled
man
this
position
for
the
princess
now
fast
growing
up
to
womanhood
was
considered
by
many
persons
as
of
doubtful
propriety
still
she
was
at
present
only
fourteen
years
old
there
was
another
young
lady
likewise
in
his
family
a
niece
of
king
henry
and
of
course
a
second
cousin
of
elizabeth
her
name
was
jane
grey
it
was
a
very
unhappy
family
the
manners
and
habits
of
all
the
members
of
it
excepting
jane
grey
seem
to
have
been
very
rude
and
irregular
the
admiral
quarreled
with
his
wife
and
was
jealous
of
the
very
servants
who
waited
upon
her
the
queen
observed
something
in
the
manners
of
her
husband
toward
the
young
princess
which
made
her
angry
both
with
him
and
her
elizabeth
resented
this
and
a
violent
quarrel
ensued
which
ended
in
their
separation
elizabeth
went
away
and
resided
afterward
at
a
place
called
hatfield
very
soon
after
this
the
queen
dowager
died
suddenly
people
accused
seymour
her
husband
of
having
poisoned
her
in
order
to
make
way
for
the
princess
elizabeth
to
be
his
wife
he
denied
this
but
he
immediately
began
to
lay
his
plans
for
securing
the
hand
of
elizabeth
there
was
a
probability
that
she
might
at
some
future
time
succeed
to
the
crown
and
then
if
he
were
her
husband
he
thought
he
should
be
the
real
sovereign
reigning
in
her
name
elizabeth
had
in
her
household
two
persons
a
certain
mrs
ashley
who
was
then
her
governess
and
a
man
named
parry
who
was
a
sort
of
treasurer
he
was
called
the
cofferer
the
admiral
gained
these
persons
over
to
his
interests
and
through
them
attempted
to
open
communications
with
elizabeth
and
persuade
her
to
enter
into
his
designs
of
course
the
whole
affair
was
managed
with
great
secrecy
they
were
all
liable
to
a
charge
of
treason
against
the
government
of
edward
by
such
plots
as
his
ministers
and
counselors
might
maintain
that
their
design
was
to
overthrow
edwards
government
and
make
elizabeth
queen
they
therefore
were
all
banded
together
to
keep
their
councils
secret
and
elizabeth
was
drawn
in
some
degree
into
the
scheme
though
precisely
how
far
was
never
fully
known
it
was
supposed
that
she
began
to
love
seymour
although
he
was
very
much
older
than
herself
and
to
be
willing
to
become
his
wife
it
is
not
surprising
that
neglected
and
forsaken
as
she
had
been
she
should
have
been
inclined
to
regard
with
favor
an
agreeable
and
influential
man
who
expressed
a
strong
affection
for
her
and
a
warm
interest
in
her
welfare
however
this
may
be
elizabeth
was
one
day
struck
with
consternation
at
hearing
that
seymour
was
arrested
by
order
of
his
brother
who
had
returned
from
scotland
and
had
received
information
of
his
designs
and
that
he
had
been
committed
to
the
tower
he
had
a
hurried
and
irregular
trial
or
what
in
those
days
was
called
a
trial
the
council
went
themselves
to
the
tower
and
had
him
brought
before
them
and
examined
he
demanded
to
have
the
charges
made
out
in
form
and
the
witnesses
confronted
with
him
but
the
council
were
satisfied
of
his
guilt
without
these
formalities
the
parliament
immediately
afterward
passed
a
bill
of
attainder
against
him
by
which
he
was
sentenced
to
death
his
brother
the
protector
signed
the
warrant
for
his
execution
and
he
was
beheaded
on
tower
hill
the
protector
sent
two
messengers
in
the
course
of
this
affair
to
elizabeth
to
see
what
they
could
ascertain
from
her
about
it
sir
robert
tyrwhitt
was
the
name
of
the
principal
one
of
these
messengers
when
the
cofferer
learned
that
they
were
at
the
gate
he
went
in
great
terror
into
his
chamber
and
said
that
he
was
undone
at
the
same
time
he
pulled
off
a
chain
from
his
neck
and
the
rings
from
his
fingers
and
threw
them
away
from
him
with
gesticulations
of
despair
the
messengers
then
came
to
elizabeth
and
told
her
falsely
as
it
seems
with
a
view
to
frighten
her
into
confessions
that
mrs
ashley
and
the
cofferer
were
both
secured
and
sent
to
the
tower
she
seemed
very
much
alarmed
she
wept
bitterly
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
regained
her
composure
she
wanted
to
know
whether
they
had
confessed
any
thing
the
protectors
messengers
would
not
tell
her
this
but
they
urged
her
to
confess
herself
all
that
had
occurred
for
whatever
it
was
they
said
that
the
evil
and
shame
would
all
be
ascribed
to
the
other
persons
concerned
and
not
to
her
on
account
of
her
youth
and
inexperience
but
elizabeth
would
confess
nothing
the
messengers
went
away
convinced
as
they
said
that
she
was
guilty
they
could
see
that
in
her
countenance
and
that
her
silence
was
owing
to
her
firm
determination
not
to
betray
her
lover
they
sent
word
to
the
protector
that
they
did
not
believe
that
any
body
would
succeed
in
drawing
the
least
information
from
her
unless
it
was
the
protector
or
young
king
edward
himself
these
mysterious
circumstances
produced
a
somewhat
unfavorable
impression
in
regard
to
elizabeth
and
there
were
some
instances
it
was
said
of
light
and
trifling
behavior
between
elizabeth
and
seymour
while
she
was
in
his
house
during
the
lifetime
of
his
wife
they
took
place
in
the
presence
of
seymours
wife
and
seem
of
no
consequence
except
to
show
that
dukes
and
princesses
got
into
frolics
sometimes
in
those
days
as
well
as
other
mortals
people
censured
mrs
ashley
for
not
enjoining
a
greater
dignity
and
propriety
of
demeanor
in
her
young
charge
and
the
government
removed
her
from
her
place
lady
tyrwhitt
who
was
the
wife
of
the
messenger
referred
to
above
that
was
sent
to
examine
elizabeth
was
appointed
to
succeed
mrs
ashley
elizabeth
was
very
much
displeased
at
this
change
she
told
lady
tyrwhitt
that
mrs
ashley
was
her
mistress
and
that
she
had
not
done
any
thing
to
make
it
necessary
for
the
council
to
put
more
mistresses
over
her
sir
robert
wrote
to
the
protector
that
she
took
the
affair
so
heavily
that
she
wept
all
night
and
lowered
all
the
next
day
he
said
that
her
attachment
to
mrs
ashley
was
very
strong
and
that
if
any
thing
were
said
against
the
lord
admiral
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
it
but
took
up
his
defense
in
the
most
prompt
and
eager
manner
how
far
it
is
true
that
elizabeth
loved
the
unfortunate
seymour
can
now
never
be
known
there
is
no
doubt
however
but
that
this
whole
affair
was
a
very
severe
trial
and
affliction
to
her
it
came
upon
her
when
she
was
but
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
of
age
and
when
she
was
in
a
position
as
well
of
an
age
which
renders
the
heart
acutely
sensitive
both
to
the
effect
of
kindness
and
of
injuries
seymour
by
his
death
was
lost
to
her
forever
and
elizabeth
lived
in
great
retirement
and
seclusion
during
the
remainder
of
her
brothers
reign
she
did
not
however
forget
mrs
ashley
and
parry
on
her
accession
to
the
throne
many
years
afterward
she
gave
them
offices
very
valuable
considering
their
station
in
life
and
was
a
true
friend
to
them
both
to
the
end
of
their
days

as
she
was
often

though
she
was
really
the
daughter
of
her
cousin
named
jane
grey
commonly
called
in
history
lady
jane
grey
her
mother
was
the
marchioness
of
dorset
and
was
the
daughter
of
one
of
king
henry
the
eighths

king
henry
had
named
her
as
the
next
in
the
order
of
succession
after
his
own
children
that
is
after
edward
his
son
and
mary
and
elizabeth
his
two
daughters
and
consequently
though
she
was
very
young
yet
as
she
might
one
day
be
queen
of
england
she
was
a
personage
of
considerable
importance
she
was
accordingly
kept
near
the
court
and
shared
in
some
respects
the
education
and
the
studies
of
the
two
princesses
lady
jane
was
about
four
years
younger
than
the
princess
elizabeth
and
the
sweetness
of
her
disposition
united
with
an
extraordinary
intellectual
superiority
which
showed
itself
at
a
very
early
period
made
her
a
universal
favorite
her
father
and
mother
the
marquis
and
marchioness
of
dorset
lived
at
an
estate
they
possessed
called
broadgate
in
leicestershire
which
is
in
the
central
part
of
england
although
they
took
their
title
from
the
county
of
dorset
which
is
on
the
southwestern
coast
they
were
very
proud
of
their
daughter
and
attached
infinite
importance
to
her
descent
from
henry
vii
and
to
the
possibility
that
she
might
one
day
succeed
to
the
english
throne
they
were
very
strict
and
severe
in
their
manners
and
paid
great
attention
to
etiquette
and
punctilio
as
persons
who
are
ambitious
of
rising
in
the
world
are
very
apt
to
do
in
all
ages
of
the
world
and
among
all
nations
those
who
have
long
been
accustomed
to
a
high
position
are
easy
and
unconstrained
in
their
manners
and
demeanor
while
those
who
have
been
newly
advanced
from
a
lower
station
or
who
are
anticipating
or
aspiring
to
such
an
advance
make
themselves
slaves
to
the
rules
of
etiquette
and
ceremony
it
was
thus
that
the
father
and
mother
of
lady
jane
anticipating
that
she
might
one
day
become
a
queen
watched
and
guarded
her
incessantly
subjected
her
to
a
thousand
unwelcome
restraints
and
repressed
all
the
spontaneous
and
natural
gayety
and
sprightliness
which
belongs
properly
to
such
a
child
she
became
however
a
very
excellent
scholar
in
consequence
of
this
state
of
things
she
had
a
private
teacher
a
man
of
great
eminence
for
his
learning
and
abilities
and
yet
of
a
very
kind
and
gentle
spirit
which
enabled
him
to
gain
a
strong
hold
on
his
pupils
affection
and
regard
his
name
was
john
aylmer
the
marquis
of
dorset
lady
janes
father
became
acquainted
with
mr
aylmer
when
he
was
quite
young
and
appointed
him
when
he
had
finished
his
education
to
come
and
reside
in
his
family
as
chaplain
and
tutor
to
his
children
aylmer
afterward
became
a
distinguished
man
was
made
bishop
of
london
and
held
many
high
offices
of
state
under
queen
elizabeth
when
she
came
to
reign
he
became
very
much
attached
to
queen
elizabeth
in
the
middle
and
latter
part
of
his
life
as
he
had
been
to
lady
jane
in
the
early
part
of
it
a
curious
incident
occurred
during
the
time
that
he
was
in
the
service
of
elizabeth
which
illustrates
the
character
of
the
man
the
queen
was
suffering
from
the
toothache
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
tooth
should
be
extracted
the
surgeon
was
ready
with
his
instruments
and
several
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
royal
household
were
in
the
queens
room
commiserating
her
sufferings
but
the
queen
dreaded
the
operation
so
excessively
that
she
could
not
summon
fortitude
enough
to
submit
to
it
aylmer
after
trying
some
time
in
vain
to
encourage
her
took
his
seat
in
the
chair
instead
of
her
and
said
to
the
surgeon
i
am
an
old
man
and
have
but
few
teeth
to
lose
but
come
draw
this
one
and
let
her
majesty
see
how
light
a
matter
it
is
one
would
not
have
supposed
that
elizabeth
would
have
allowed
this
to
be
done
but
she
did
and
finding
that
aylmer
made
so
light
of
the
operation
she
submitted
to
have
it
performed
upon
herself
but
to
return
to
lady
jane
she
was
very
strongly
attached
to
her
teacher
and
made
great
progress
in
the
studies
which
he
arranged
for
her
ladies
of
high
rank
in
those
days
were
accustomed
to
devote
great
attention
to
the
ancient
and
modern
languages
there
was
in
fact
a
great
necessity
then
as
indeed
there
is
now
for
a
european
princess
to
be
acquainted
with
the
principal
languages
of
europe
for
the
various
royal
families
were
continually
intermarrying
with
each
other
which
led
to
a
great
many
visits
and
other
intercourse
between
the
different
courts
there
was
also
a
great
deal
of
intercourse
with
the
pope
in
which
the
latin
language
was
the
medium
of
communication
lady
jane
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
to
all
these
studies
and
made
rapid
proficiency
in
them
all
the
princess
elizabeth
was
also
an
excellent
scholar
her
teacher
was
a
very
learned
and
celebrated
man
named
roger
ascham
she
spoke
french
and
italian
as
fluently
as
she
did
english
she
also
wrote
and
spoke
latin
with
correctness
and
readiness
she
made
considerable
progress
in
greek
too
she
could
write
the
greek
character
very
beautifully
and
could
express
herself
tolerably
well
in
conversation
in
that
language
one
of
her
companions
a
young
lady
of
the
name
of
cecil
is
said
to
have
spoken
greek
as
well
as
english
roger
ascham
took
great
interest
in
advancing
the
princess
in
these
studies
and
in
the
course
of
these
his
instructions
he
became
acquainted
with
lady
jane
and
he
praises
very
highly
in
his
letters
the
industry
and
assiduity
of
lady
jane
in
similar
pursuits
illustration
lady
jane
grey
at
study
one
day
roger
ascham
being
on
a
journey
from
the
north
of
england
to
london
stopped
to
make
a
call
at
the
mansion
of
the
marquis
of
dorset
he
found
that
the
family
were
all
away
they
had
gone
off
upon
a
hunting
excursion
in
the
park
lady
jane
however
had
been
left
at
home
and
ascham
went
in
to
see
her
he
found
her
in
the
library
reading
greek
ascham
examined
her
a
little
and
was
very
much
surprised
to
find
how
well
acquainted
with
the
language
she
had
become
although
she
was
then
only
about
fifteen
years
old
he
told
her
that
he
should
like
very
much
to
have
her
write
him
a
letter
in
greek
and
this
she
readily
promised
to
do
he
asked
her
also
how
it
happened
that
at
her
age
she
had
made
such
advances
in
learning
i
will
tell
you
said
she
how
it
has
happened
one
of
the
greatest
benefits
that
god
ever
conferred
upon
me
was
in
giving
me
so
sharp
and
severe
parents
and
so
gentle
a
teacher
for
when
i
am
in
the
presence
of
either
my
father
or
mother
whether
i
speak
keep
silence
sit
stand
or
go
eat
drink
be
merry
or
sad
be
sewing
playing
dancing
or
doing
any
thing
else
i
must
do
it
as
it
were
in
just
such
weight
measure
and
number
as
perfectly
as
possible
or
else
i
am
so
sharply
taunted
so
cruelly
threatened
yea
presently
sometimes
with
pinches
nips
and
bobs
and
other
ways
which
i
will
not
name
for
the
honor
i
bear
my
parents
that
i
am
continually
teased
and
tormented
and
then
when
the
time
comes
for
me
to
go
to
mr
aylmer
he
teaches
me
so
gently
so
pleasantly
and
with
such
fair
allurements
to
learning
that
i
think
all
the
time
nothing
while
i
am
with
him
and
i
am
always
sorry
to
go
away
from
him
because
whatsoever
else
i
do
but
learning
is
full
of
grief
trouble
fear
and
suffering
lady
jane
grey
was
an
intimate
friend
and
companion
of
the
young
king
edward
as
long
as
he
lived
edward
died
when
he
was
sixteen
years
of
age
so
that
he
did
not
reach
the
period
which
his
father
had
assigned
for
his
reigning
in
his
own
name
one
of
king
edwards
most
prominent
and
powerful
ministers
during
the
latter
part
of
his
life
was
the
earl
of
northumberland
the
original
name
of
the
earl
of
northumberland
was
john
dudley
he
was
one
of
the
train
who
came
in
the
procession
at
the
close
of
the
baptism
of
elizabeth
carrying
the
presents
he
was
a
protestant
and
was
very
friendly
to
edward
and
to
lady
jane
grey
for
they
were
protestants
too
but
his
feelings
and
policy
were
hostile
to
mary
for
she
was
a
catholic
mary
was
sometimes
treated
very
harshly
by
him
and
she
was
subjected
to
many
privations
and
hardships
on
account
of
her
religious
faith
the
government
of
edward
justified
these
measures
on
account
of
the
necessity
of
promoting
the
reformation
and
discouraging
popery
by
every
means
in
their
power
northumberland
supposed
too
that
it
was
safe
to
do
this
for
edward
being
very
young
it
was
probable
that
he
would
live
and
reign
a
long
time
it
is
true
that
mary
was
named
in
her
fathers
will
as
his
successor
if
she
outlived
him
but
then
it
was
highly
probable
that
she
would
not
outlive
him
for
she
was
several
years
older
than
he
all
these
calculations
however
were
spoiled
by
the
sudden
failure
of
edwards
health
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
northumberland
was
much
alarmed
at
this
he
knew
at
once
that
if
edward
should
die
and
mary
succeed
him
all
his
power
would
be
gone
and
he
determined
to
make
desperate
efforts
to
prevent
such
a
result
it
must
not
be
understood
however
that
in
coming
to
this
resolution
northumberland
considered
himself
as
intending
and
planning
a
deliberate
usurpation
of
power
there
was
a
real
uncertainty
in
respect
to
the
question
who
was
the
true
and
rightful
heir
to
the
crown
northumberland
was
undoubtedly
strongly
biased
by
his
interest
but
he
may
have
been
unconscious
of
the
bias
and
in
advocating
the
mode
of
succession
on
which
the
continuance
of
his
own
power
depended
he
may
have
really
believed
that
he
was
only
maintaining
what
was
in
itself
rightful
and
just
in
fact
there
is
no
mode
which
human
ingenuity
has
ever
yet
devised
for
determining
the
hands
in
which
the
supreme
executive
of
a
nation
shall
be
lodged
which
will
always
avoid
doubt
and
contention
if
this
power
devolves
by
hereditary
descent
no
rules
can
be
made
so
minute
and
full
as
that
cases
will
not
sometimes
occur
that
will
transcend
them
if
on
the
other
hand
the
plan
of
election
be
adopted
there
will
often
be
technical
doubts
about
a
portion
of
the
votes
and
cases
will
sometimes
occur
where
the
result
will
depend
upon
this
doubtful
portion
thus
there
will
be
disputes
under
any
system
and
ambitious
men
will
seize
such
occasions
to
struggle
for
power
in
order
that
our
readers
may
clearly
understand
the
nature
of
the
plan
which
northumberland
adopted
we
present
on
the
following
page
a
sort
of
genealogical
table
of
the
royal
family
of
england

the

explanation
this
table
gives
the
immediate
descendants
of
henry
vii
a
descent
being
denoted
by
the
sign
the
names
of
the
persons
whom
they
respectively
married
are
in
italics
those
who
became
sovereigns
of
england
are
in
small
capitals
and
the
order
in
which
they
reigned
is
denoted
by
the
figures
prefixed
to
their
names
by
examination
of
this
table
it
will
be
seen
that
king
henry
vii
left
a
son
and
two
daughters
the
son
was
king
henry
viii
and
he
had
three
children
his
third
child
was
king
edward
vi
who
was
now
about
to
die
the
other
two
were
the
princesses
mary
and
elizabeth
who
would
naturally
be
considered
the
next
heirs
after
edward
and
besides
king
henry
had
left
a
will
as
has
been
already
explained
confirming
their
rights
to
the
succession
this
will
he
had
made
near
the
time
of
his
death
but
it
will
be
recollected
that
during
his
lifetime
both
the
marriages
from
which
these
princesses
had
sprung
had
been
formally
annulled
his
marriage
with
catharine
of
aragon
had
been
annulled
on
one
plea
and
that
of
anne
boleyn
on
another
both
these
decrees
of
annulment
had
afterward
been
revoked
and
the
right
of
the
princesses
to
succeed
had
been
restored
or
attempted
to
be
restored
by
the
will
still
it
admitted
of
a
question
after
all
whether
mary
and
elizabeth
were
to
be
considered
as
the
children
of
true
and
lawful
wives
or
not
if
they
were
not
then
lady
jane
grey
was
the
next
heir
for
she
was
placed
next
to
the
princesses
by
king
henry
the
eighths
will
this
will
for
some
reason
or
other
set
aside
a
the
descendants
of
margaret
who
went
to
scotland
as
the
wife
of
james
iv
of
that
country
what
right
the
king
had
thus
to
disinherit
the
children
of
his
sister
margaret
was
a
great
question
among
her
descendants
was
mary
queen
of
scots
as
will
be
seen
by
the
table
and
she
was
at
this
time
the
representative
of
that
branch
of
the
family
the
friends
of
mary
queen
of
scots
claimed
that
she
was
the
lawful
heir
to
the
english
throne
after
edward
they
maintained
that
the
marriage
of
catharine
the
princess
marys
mother
and
also
that
of
anne
boleyn
elizabeths
mother
had
both
been
annulled
and
that
the
will
could
not
restore
them
they
maintained
also
that
the
will
was
equally
powerless
in
setting
aside
the
claims
of
margaret
her
grandmother
mary
queen
of
scots
though
silent
now
advanced
her
claim
subsequently
and
made
elizabeth
a
great
deal
of
trouble
then
there
was
besides
these
a
third
party
who
maintained
that
king
henry
the
eighths
will
was
not
effectual
in
legalizing
again
the
annulled
marriages
but
that
it
was
sufficient
to
set
aside
the
claims
of
margaret
of
course
with
them
lady
jane
grey
who
as
will
be
seen
by
the
table
was
the
representative
of
the
second
sister
of
henry
viii
was
the
only
heir
the
earl
of
northumberland
embraced
this
view
his
motive
was
to
raise
lady
jane
grey
to
the
throne
in
order
to
exclude
the
princess
mary
whose
accession
he
knew
very
well
would
bring
all
his
greatness
to
a
very
sudden
end
the
earl
of
northumberland
was
at
this
time
the
principal
minister
of
the
young
king
the
protector
somerset
had
fallen
long
ago
northumberland
whose
name
was
then
john
dudley
had
supplanted
him
and
had
acquired
so
great
influence
and
power
at
court
that
almost
every
thing
seemed
to
be
at
his
disposal
he
was
however
generally
hated
by
the
other
courtiers
and
by
the
nation
men
who
gain
the
confidence
of
a
young
or
feebleminded
prince
so
as
to
wield
a
great
power
not
properly
their
own
are
almost
always
odious
it
was
expected
however
that
his
career
would
be
soon
brought
to
an
end
as
all
knew
that
king
edward
must
die
and
it
was
generally
understood
that
mary
was
to
succeed
him
northumberland
however
was
very
anxious
to
devise
some
scheme
to
continue
his
power
and
in
revolving
the
subject
in
his
mind
he
conceived
of
plans
which
seemed
to
promise
not
only
to
continue
but
also
greatly
to
increase
it
his
scheme
was
to
have
the
princesses
claims
set
aside
and
lady
jane
grey
raised
to
the
throne
he
had
several
sons
one
of
them
was
young
handsome
and
accomplished
he
thought
of
proposing
him
to
lady
janes
father
as
the
husband
of
lady
jane
and
to
induce
the
marquis
to
consent
to
this
plan
he
promised
to
obtain
a
dukedom
for
him
by
means
of
his
influence
with
the
king
the
marquis
agreed
to
the
proposal
lady
jane
did
not
object
to
the
husband
they
offered
her
the
dukedom
was
obtained
and
the
marriage
together
with
two
others
which
northumberland
had
arranged
to
strengthen
his
influence
were
celebrated
all
on
the
same
day
with
great
festivities
and
rejoicings
the
people
looked
on
moodily
jealous
and
displeased
though
they
had
no
open
ground
of
displeasure
except
that
it
was
unsuitable
to
have
such
scenes
of
gayety
and
rejoicing
among
the
high
officers
of
the
court
while
the
young
monarch
himself
was
lying
upon
his
dying
bed
they
did
not
yet
know
that
it
was
northumberlands
plan
to
raise
his
new
daughterinlaw
to
the
throne
northumberland
thought
it
would
greatly
increase
his
prospect
of
success
if
he
could
obtain
some
act
of
acknowledgment
of
lady
janes
claims
to
the
crown
before
edward
died
an
opportunity
soon
occurred
for
effecting
this
purpose
one
day
as
he
was
sitting
by
young
edwards
bedside
he
turned
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
the
reformation
which
had
made
great
progress
during
edwards
reign
and
he
led
edward
on
in
the
conversation
until
he
remarked
that
it
was
a
great
pity
to
have
the
work
all
undone
by
marys
accession
for
she
was
a
catholic
and
would
of
course
endeavor
to
bring
the
country
back
again
under
the
spiritual
dominion
of
rome
northumberland
then
told
him
that
there
was
one
way
and
one
way
only
to
avert
such
a
calamity
and
that
was
to
make
lady
jane
his
heir
instead
of
mary
king
edward
was
a
very
thoughtful
considerate
and
conscientious
boy
and
was
very
desirous
of
doing
what
he
considered
his
duty
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
sustain
the
reformation
and
to
prevent
the
catholic
power
from
gaining
ascendency
in
england
again
he
was
therefore
easily
persuaded
to
accede
to
northumberlands
plan
especially
as
he
was
himself
strongly
attached
to
lady
jane
who
had
often
been
his
playmate
and
companion
the
king
accordingly
sent
for
three
judges
of
the
realm
and
directed
them
to
draw
up
a
deed
of
assignment
by
which
the
crown
was
to
be
conveyed
to
lady
jane
on
the
young
kings
death
mary
and
elizabeth
being
alike
excluded
the
judges
were
afraid
to
do
this
for
by
king
henry
the
eighths
settlement
of
the
crown
all
those
persons
who
should
do
any
thing
to
disturb
the
succession
as
he
arranged
it
were
declared
to
be
guilty
of
high
treason
the
judges
knew
very
well
therefore
that
if
they
should
do
what
the
king
required
of
them
and
then
if
the
friends
of
lady
jane
should
fail
of
establishing
her
upon
the
throne
the
end
of
the
affair
would
be
the
cutting
off
of
their
own
heads
in
the
tower
they
represented
this
to
the
king
and
begged
to
be
excused
from
the
duty
that
he
required
of
them
northumberland
was
in
a
great
rage
at
this
and
seemed
almost
ready
to
break
out
against
the
judges
in
open
violence
they
however
persisted
in
their
refusal
to
do
what
they
well
knew
would
subject
them
to
the
pains
and
penalties
of
treason
northumberland
finding
that
threats
and
violence
would
not
succeed
contrived
another
mode
of
obviating
the
difficulty
he
proposed
to
protect
the
judges
from
any
possible
evil
consequences
of
their
act
by
a
formal
pardon
for
it
signed
by
the
king
and
sealed
with
the
great
seal
so
that
in
case
they
were
ever
charged
with
treason
the
pardon
would
save
them
from
punishment
this
plan
succeeded
the
pardon
was
made
out
being
written
with
great
formality
upon
a
parchment
roll
and
sealed
with
the
great
seal
the
judges
then
prepared
and
signed
the
deed
of
settlement
by
which
the
crown
was
given
to
lady
jane
though
after
all
they
did
it
with
much
reluctance
and
many
forebodings
northumberland
next
wanted
to
contrive
some
plan
for
getting
the
princesses
into
his
power
in
order
to
prevent
their
heading
any
movement
in
behalf
of
their
own
claims
at
the
death
of
the
king
he
was
also
desirous
of
making
such
arrangements
as
to
conceal
the
death
of
the
king
for
a
few
days
after
it
should
take
place
in
order
that
he
might
get
lady
jane
and
her
officers
in
complete
possession
of
the
kingdom
before
the
demise
of
the
crown
should
be
generally
known
for
this
purpose
he
dismissed
the
regular
physicians
who
had
attended
upon
the
king
and
put
him
under
the
charge
of
a
woman
who
pretended
that
she
had
a
medicine
that
would
certainly
cure
him
he
sent
also
messengers
to
the
princesses
who
were
then
in
the
country
north
of
london
requesting
that
they
would
come
to
greenwich
to
be
near
the
sick
chamber
where
their
brother
was
lying
that
they
might
cheer
and
comfort
him
in
his
sickness
and
pain
the
princesses
obeyed
the
summons
they
each
set
out
immediately
on
the
journey
and
moved
toward
london
on
their
way
to
greenwich
in
the
mean
time
edward
was
rapidly
declining
the
change
in
the
treatment
which
took
place
when
his
physicians
left
him
made
him
worse
instead
of
better
his
cough
increased
his
breathing
became
more
labored
and
difficult
in
a
word
his
case
presented
all
the
symptoms
of
approaching
dissolution
at
length
he
died
northumberland
attempted
to
keep
the
fact
concealed
until
after
the
princesses
should
arrive
that
he
might
get
them
into
his
power
some
faithful
friend
however
made
all
haste
to
meet
them
in
order
to
inform
them
what
was
going
on
in
this
way
mary
received
intelligence
of
her
brothers
death
when
she
had
almost
reached
london
and
was
informed
also
of
the
plans
of
northumberland
for
raising
lady
jane
to
the
throne
the
two
princesses
were
extremely
alarmed
and
both
turned
back
at
once
toward
the
northward
again
mary
stopped
to
write
a
letter
to
the
council
remonstrating
against
their
delay
in
proclaiming
her
queen
and
then
proceeded
rapidly
to
a
strong
castle
at
a
place
called
framlingham
in
the
county
of
suffolk
on
the
eastern
coast
of
england
she
made
this
her
headquarters
because
she
supposed
that
the
people
of
that
county
were
particularly
friendly
to
her
and
then
besides
it
was
near
the
sea
and
in
case
the
course
of
events
should
turn
against
her
she
could
make
her
escape
to
foreign
lands
it
is
true
that
the
prospect
of
being
fugitive
and
an
exile
was
very
dark
and
gloomy
but
it
was
not
so
terrible
as
the
idea
of
being
shut
up
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
or
being
beheaded
on
a
block
for
treason
in
the
mean
time
northumberland
went
at
the
head
of
a
troop
of
his
adherents
to
the
residence
of
lady
jane
grey
informed
her
of
the
death
of
edward
and
announced
to
her
their
determination
to
proclaim
her
queen
lady
jane
was
very
much
astonished
at
this
news
at
first
she
absolutely
refused
the
offered
honor
but
the
solicitations
and
urgency
of
northumberland
and
of
her
father
and
her
young
husband
at
length
prevailed
she
was
conducted
to
london
and
instated
in
at
least
the
semblance
of
power
as
the
news
of
these
transactions
spread
throughout
the
land
a
universal
and
strong
excitement
was
produced
every
body
at
once
taking
sides
either
for
mary
or
lady
jane
bands
of
armed
men
began
to
assemble
it
soon
became
apparent
however
that
beyond
the
immediate
precincts
of
london
the
country
was
almost
unanimous
for
mary
they
dreaded
it
is
true
the
danger
which
they
anticipated
from
her
catholic
faith
but
still
they
had
all
considered
it
a
settled
point
since
the
death
of
henry
the
eighth
that
mary
was
to
reign
whenever
edward
should
die
and
this
general
expectation
that
she
would
be
queen
had
passed
insensibly
into
an
opinion
that
she
ought
to
be
considered
strictly
as
a
legal
question
it
was
certainly
doubtful
which
of
the
four
claimants
to
the
throne
had
the
strongest
title
but
the
public
were
not
disposed
so
to
regard
it
they
chose
on
the
whole
that
mary
should
reign
large
military
masses
consequently
flocked
to
her
standard
elizabeth
took
sides
with
her
and
as
it
was
important
to
give
as
much
public
effect
to
her
adhesion
as
possible
they
furnished
elizabeth
with
a
troop
of
a
thousand
horsemen
at
the
head
of
which
she
rode
to
meet
mary
and
tender
her
aid
northumberland
went
forth
at
the
head
of
such
forces
as
he
could
collect
but
he
soon
found
that
the
attempt
was
vain
his
troops
forsook
him
the
castles
which
had
at
first
been
under
his
command
surrendered
themselves
to
mary
the
tower
of
london
went
over
to
her
side
finally
all
being
lost
northumberland
himself
was
taken
prisoner
and
all
his
influential
friends
with
him
and
were
committed
to
the
tower
lady
jane
herself
too
together
with
her
husband
and
father
were
seized
and
sent
to
prison
northumberland
was
immediately
put
upon
his
trial
for
treason
he
was
condemned
and
brought
at
once
to
the
block
in
fact
the
whole
affair
moved
very
promptly
and
rapidly
on
from
its
commencement
to
its
consummation
edward
the
sixth
died
on
the
th
of
july
and
it
was
only
the
d
of
august
when
northumberland
was
beheaded
the
period
for
which
the
unhappy
lady
jane
enjoyed
the
honor
of
being
called
a
queen
was
nine
days
it
was
about
a
month
after
this
that
mary
passed
from
the
tower
through
the
city
of
london
in
a
grand
triumphal
procession
to
be
crowned
the
royal
chariot
covered
with
cloth
of
golden
tissue
was
drawn
by
six
horses
most
splendidly
caparisoned
elizabeth
who
had
aided
her
sister
so
far
as
she
could
in
the
struggle
was
admitted
to
share
the
triumph
she
had
a
carriage
drawn
by
six
horses
too
with
cloth
and
decorations
of
silver
they
proceeded
in
this
manner
attended
and
followed
by
a
great
cavalcade
of
nobles
and
soldiery
to
westminster
abbey
where
mary
took
her
seat

great
formality

when

mary
ascended

she
was

maiden
lady
not
far
from
thirtyfive
years
of
age
she
was
cold
austere
and
forbidding
in
her
appearance
and
manners
though
probably
conscientious
and
honest
in
her
convictions
of
duty
she
was
a
very
firm
and
decided
catholic
or
rather
she
evinced
a
certain
strict
adherence
to
the
principles
of
her
religious
faith
which
we
generally
call
firmness
when
it
is
exhibited
by
those
whose
opinions
agree
with
our
own
though
we
are
very
apt
to
name
it
bigotry
in
those
who
differ
from
us
for
instance
when
the
body
of
young
edward
her
brother
after
his
death
was
to
be
deposited
in
the
last
home
of
the
english
kings
in
westminster
abbey
which
is
a
very
magnificent
cathedral
a
little
way
up
the
river
from
london
the
services
were
of
course
conducted
according
to
the
ritual
of
the
english
church
which
was
then
protestant
mary
however
could
not
conscientiously
countenance
such
services
even
by
being
present
at
them
she
accordingly
assembled
her
immediate
attendants
and
personal
friends
in
her
own
private
chapel
and
celebrated
the
interment
there
with
catholic
priests
by
a
service
conformed
to
the
catholic
ritual
was
it
a
bigoted
or
only
a
firm
and
proper
attachment
to
her
own
faith
which
forbade
her
joining
in
the
national
commemoration
the
reader
must
decide
but
in
deciding
he
is
bound
to
render
the
same
verdict
that
he
would
have
given
if
it
had
been
a
case
of
a
protestant
withdrawing
thus
from
catholic
forms
at
all
events
whether
bigoted
or
not
mary
was
doubtless
sincere
but
she
was
so
cold
and
stern
and
austere
in
her
character
that
she
was
very
little
likely
to
be
loved
there
were
a
great
many
persons
who
wished
to
become
her
husband
but
their
motives
were
to
share
her
grandeur
and
power
among
these
persons
the
most
prominent
one
and
the
one
apparently
most
likely
to
succeed
was
a
prince
of
spain
his
name
was
philip
illustration
portrait
of
philip
of
spain
it
was
his
fathers
plan
and
not
his
own
that
he
should
marry
queen
mary
his
father
was
at
this
time
the
most
wealthy
and
powerful
monarch
in
europe
his
name
was
charles
he
is
commonly
called
in
history
charles
v
of
spain
he
was
not
only
king
of
spain
but
emperor
of
germany
he
resided
sometimes
at
madrid
and
sometimes
at
brussels
in
flanders
his
son
philip
had
been
married
to
a
portuguese
princess
but
his
wife
had
died
and
thus
philip
was
a
widower
still
he
was
only
twentyseven
years
of
age
but
he
was
as
stern
severe
and
repulsive
in
his
manners
as
mary
his
personal
appearance
too
corresponded
with
his
character
he
was
a
very
decided
catholic
also
and
in
his
natural
spirit
haughty
ambitious
and
domineering
the
emperor
charles
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
young
edwards
death
and
of
marys
accession
to
the
english
throne
conceived
the
plan
of
proposing
to
her
his
son
philip
for
a
husband
he
sent
over
a
wise
and
sagacious
statesman
from
his
court
to
make
the
proposition
and
to
urge
it
by
such
reasons
as
would
be
most
likely
to
influence
marys
mind
and
the
minds
of
the
great
officers
of
her
government
the
embassador
managed
the
affair
well
in
fact
it
was
probably
easy
to
manage
it
mary
would
naturally
be
pleased
with
the
idea
of
such
a
young
husband
who
besides
being
young
and
accomplished
was
the
son
of
the
greatest
potentate
in
europe
and
likely
one
day
to
take
his
fathers
place
in
that
lofty
elevation
besides
mary
queen
of
scots
who
had
rival
claims
to
queen
marys
throne
had
married
or
was
about
to
marry
the
son
of
the
king
of
france
and
there
was
a
little
glory
in
outshining
her
by
having
for
a
husband
a
son
of
the
king
of
spain
it
might
however
perhaps
be
a
question
which
was
the
greatest
match
for
though
the
court
of
paris
was
the
most
brilliant
spain
being
at
that
time
possessed
of
the
gold
and
silver
mines
of
its
american
colonies
was
at
least
the
richest
country
in
the
world
marys
ministers
when
they
found
that
mary
herself
liked
the
plan
fell
in
with
it
too
mary
had
been
beginning
very
quietly
indeed
but
very
efficiently
her
measures
for
bringing
back
the
english
government
and
nation
to
the
catholic
faith
her
ministers
told
her
now
however
that
if
she
wished
to
succeed
in
effecting
this
match
she
must
suspend
all
these
plans
until
the
match
was
consummated
the
people
of
england
were
generally
of
the
protestant
faith
they
had
been
very
uneasy
and
restless
under
the
progress
which
the
queen
had
been
making
in
silencing
protestant
preachers
and
bringing
back
catholic
rites
and
ceremonies
and
now
if
they
found
that
their
queen
was
going
to
marry
so
rigid
and
uncompromising
a
catholic
as
philip
of
spain
they
would
be
doubly
alarmed
she
must
suspend
therefore
for
a
time
her
measures
for
restoring
papacy
unless
she
was
willing
to
give
up
her
husband
the
queen
saw
that
this
was
the
alternative
and
she
decided
on
following
her
ministers
advice
she
did
all
in
her
power
to
quiet
and
calm
the
public
mind
in
order
to
prepare
the
way
for
announcing
the
proposed
connection
rumors
however
began
to
be
spread
abroad
that
such
a
design
was
entertained
before
mary
was
fully
prepared
to
promulgate
it
these
rumors
produced
great
excitement
and
awakened
strong
opposition
the
people
knew
philips
ambitious
and
overbearing
character
and
they
believed
that
if
he
were
to
come
to
england
as
the
husband
of
the
queen
the
whole
government
would
pass
into
his
hands
and
as
he
would
naturally
be
very
much
under
the
influence
of
his
father
the
connection
was
likely
to
result
in
making
england
a
mere
appendage
to
the
already
vast
dominions
of
the
emperor
the
house
of
commons
appointed
a
committee
of
twenty
members
and
sent
them
to
the
queen
with
a
humble
petition
that
she
would
not
marry
a
foreigner
the
queen
was
much
displeased
at
receiving
such
a
petition
and
she
dissolved
the
parliament
the
members
dispersed
carrying
with
them
every
where
expressions
of
their
dissatisfaction
and
fear
england
they
said
was
about
to
become
a
province
of
spain
and
the
prospect
of
such
a
consummation
wherever
the
tidings
went
filled
the
people
of
the
country
with
great
alarm
queen
marys
principal
minister
of
state
at
this
time
was
a
crafty
politician
whose
name
was
gardiner
gardiner
sent
word
to
the
emperor
that
there
was
great
opposition
to
his
sons
marriage
in
england
and
that
he
feared
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
accomplish
it
unless
the
terms
of
the
contract
of
marriage
were
made
very
favorable
to
the
queen
and
to
england
and
unless
the
emperor
could
furnish
him
with
a
large
sum
of
money
to
use
as
a
means
of
bringing
influential
persons
of
the
realm
to
favor
it
charles
decided
to
send
the
money
he
borrowed
it
of
some
of
the
rich
cities
of
germany
making
his
son
philip
give
his
bond
to
repay
it
as
soon
as
he
should
get
possession
of
his
bride
and
of
the
rich
and
powerful
country
over
which
she
reigned
the
amount
thus
remitted
to
england
is
said
by
the
historians
of
those
days
to
have
been
a
sum
equal
to
two
millions
of
dollars
the
bribery
was
certainly
on
a
very
respectable
scale
the
emperor
also
sent
a
very
magnificent
embassy
to
london
with
a
distinguished
nobleman
at
its
head
to
arrange
the
terms
and
contracts
of
the
marriage
this
embassy
came
in
great
state
and
during
their
residence
in
london
were
the
objects
of
great
attention
and
parade
the
eclat
of
their
reception
and
the
influence
of
the
bribes
seemed
to
silence
opposition
to
the
scheme
open
opposition
ceased
to
be
expressed
though
a
strong
and
inveterate
determination
against
the
measure
was
secretly
extending
itself
throughout
the
realm
this
however
did
not
prevent
the
negotiations
from
going
on
the
terms
were
probably
all
fully
understood
and
agreed
upon
before
the
embassy
came
so
that
nothing
remained
but
the
formalities
of
writing
and
signing
the
articles
some
of
the
principal
stipulations
of
these
articles
were
that
philip
was
to
have
the
title
of
king
of
england
jointly
with
marys
title
of
queen
mary
was
also
to
share
with
him
in
the
same
way
his
titles
in
spain
it
was
agreed
that
mary
should
have
the
exclusive
power
of
the
appointment
of
officers
of
government
in
england
and
that
no
spaniards
should
be
eligible
at
all
particular
provisions
were
made
in
respect
to
the
children
which
might
result
from
the
marriage
as
to
how
they
should
inherit
rights
of
government
in
the
two
countries
philip
had
one
son
already
by
his
former
wife
this
son
was
to
succeed
his
father
in
the
kingdom
of
spain
but
the
other
dominions
of
philip
on
the
continent
were
to
descend
to
the
offspring
of
this
new
marriage
in
modes
minutely
specified
to
fit
all
possible
cases
which
might
occur
the
making
of
all
these
specifications
however
turned
out
to
be
labor
lost
as
mary
never
had
children
it
was
also
specially
agreed
that
philip
should
not
bring
spanish
or
foreign
domestics
into
the
realm
to
give
uneasiness
to
the
english
people
that
he
would
never
take
the
queen
out
of
england
nor
carry
any
of
the
children
away
without
the
consent
of
the
english
nobility
and
that
if
the
queen
were
to
die
before
him
all
his
rights
and
claims
of
every
sort
in
respect
to
england
should
forever
cease
he
also
agreed
that
he
would
never
carry
away
any
of
the
jewels
or
other
property
of
the
crown
nor
suffer
any
other
person
to
do
so
these
stipulations
guarding
so
carefully
the
rights
of
mary
and
of
england
were
intended
to
satisfy
the
english
people
and
remove
their
objections
to
the
match
they
produced
some
effect
but
the
hostility
was
too
deeply
seated
to
be
so
easily
allayed
it
grew
on
the
contrary
more
and
more
threatening
until
at
length
a
conspiracy
was
formed
by
a
number
of
influential
and
powerful
men
and
a
plan
of
open
rebellion
organized
the
leader
in
this
plan
was
sir
thomas
wyatt
and
the
outbreak
which
followed
is
known
in
history
as
wyatts
rebellion
another
of
the
leaders
was
the
duke
of
suffolk
who
it
will
be
recollected
was
the
father
of
lady
jane
grey
this
led
people
to
suppose
that
the
plan
of
the
conspirators
was
not
merely
to
prevent
the
consummation
of
the
spanish
match
but
to
depose
queen
mary
entirely
and
to
raise
the
lady
jane
to
the
throne
however
this
may
be
an
extensive
and
formidable
conspiracy
was
formed
there
were
to
have
been
several
risings
in
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
they
all
failed
except
the
one
which
wyatt
himself
was
to
head
which
was
in
kent
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
country
this
succeeded
so
far
at
least
that
a
considerable
force
was
collected
and
began
to
advance
toward
london
from
the
southern
side
queen
mary
was
very
much
alarmed
she
had
no
armed
force
in
readiness
to
encounter
this
danger
she
sent
messengers
across
the
thames
and
down
the
river
to
meet
wyatt
who
was
advancing
at
the
head
of
four
thousand
men
to
ask
what
it
was
that
he
demanded
he
replied
that
the
queen
must
be
delivered
up
as
his
prisoner
and
also
the
tower
of
london
be
surrendered
to
him
this
showed
that
his
plan
was
to
depose
the
queen
mary
rejected
these
proposals
at
once
and
having
no
forces
to
meet
this
new
enemy
she
had
to
retreat
from
westminster
into
the
city
of
london
and
here
she
took
refuge
in
the
city
hall
called
the
guildhall
and
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
the
city
authorities
some
of
her
friends
urged
her
to
take
shelter
in
the
tower
but
she
had
more
confidence
she
said
in
the
faithfulness
and
loyalty
of
her
subjects
than
in
castle
walls
wyatt
continued
to
advance
he
was
still
upon
the
south
side
of
the
river
there
was
but
one
bridge
across
the
thames
at
london
in
those
days
though
there
are
half
a
dozen
now
and
this
one
was
so
strongly
barricaded
and
guarded
that
wyatt
did
not
dare
to
attempt
to
cross
it
he
went
up
the
river
therefore
to
cross
at
a
higher
point
and
this
circuit
and
several
accidental
circumstances
which
occurred
detained
him
so
long
that
a
considerable
force
had
been
got
together
to
receive
him
when
he
was
ready
to
enter
the
city
he
pushed
boldly
on
into
the
narrow
streets
which
received
him
like
a
trap
or
a
snare
the
city
troops
hemmed
up
his
way
after
he
had
entered
they
barricaded
the
streets
they
shut
the
gates
and
armed
men
poured
in
to
take
possession
of
all
the
avenues
wyatt
depended
upon
finding
the
people
of
london
on
his
side
they
turned
instead
against
him
all
hope
of
success
in
his
enterprise
and
all
possibility
of
escape
from
his
own
awful
danger
disappeared
together
a
herald
came
from
the
queens
officer
calling
upon
him
to
surrender
himself
quietly
and
save
the
effusion
of
blood
he
surrendered
in
an
agony
of
terror
and
despair
the
duke
of
suffolk
learned
these
facts
in
another
county
where
he
was
endeavoring
to
raise
a
force
to
aid
wyatt
he
immediately
fled
and
hid
himself
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
domestics
he
was
betrayed
however
seized
and
sent
to
the
tower
many
other
prominent
actors
in
the
insurrection
were
arrested
and
the
others
fled
in
all
directions
wherever
they
could
find
concealment
or
safety
lady
janes
life
had
been
spared
thus
far
although
she
had
been
in
fact
guilty
of
treason
against
mary
by
the
former
attempt
to
take
the
crown
she
now
however
two
days
after
the
capture
of
wyatt
received
word
that
she
must
prepare
to
die
she
was
of
course
surprised
and
shocked
at
the
suddenness
of
this
announcement
but
she
soon
regained
her
composure
and
passed
through
the
awful
scenes
preceding
her
death
with
a
fortitude
amounting
to
heroism
which
was
very
astonishing
in
one
so
young
her
husband
was
to
die
too
he
was
beheaded
first
and
she
saw
the
headless
body
as
it
was
brought
back
from
the
place
of
execution
before
her
turn
came
she
acknowledged
her
guilt
in
having
attempted
to
seize
her
cousins
crown
as
the
attempt
to
seize
this
crown
failed
mankind
consider
her
technically
guilty
if
it
had
succeeded
mary
instead
of
jane
would
have
been
the
traitor
who
would
have
died
for
attempting
criminally
to
usurp
a
throne
in
the
mean
time
wyatt
and
suffolk
remained
prisoners
in
the
tower
suffolk
was
overwhelmed
with
remorse
and
sorrow
at
having
been
the
means
by
his
selfish
ambition
of
the
cruel
death
of
so
innocent
and
lovely
a
child
he
did
not
suffer
this
anguish
long
however
for
five
days
after
his
son
and
lady
jane
were
executed
his
head
fell
too
from
the
block
wyatt
was
reserved
a
little
longer
he
was
more
formally
tried
and
in
his
examination
he
asserted
that
the
princess
elizabeth
was
involved
in
the
conspiracy
officers
were
immediately
sent
to
arrest
elizabeth
she
was
taken
to
a
royal
palace
at
westminster
just
above
london
called
whitehall
and
shut
up
there
in
close
confinement
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
visit
her
or
speak
to
her
the
particulars
of
this
imprisonment
will
be
described
more
fully
in
the
next
chapter
fifty
or
sixty
common
conspirators
not
worthy
of
being
beheaded
with
an
ax
were
hanged
and
a
company
of
six
hundred
more
were
brought
their
hands
tied
and
halters
about
their
necks
a
miserable
gang
into
marys
presence
before
her
palace
to
be
pardoned
wyatt
was
then
executed
when
he
came
to
die
however
he
retracted
what
he
had
alleged
of
elizabeth
he
declared
that
she
was
entirely
innocent
of
any
participation
in
the
scheme
of
rebellion
elizabeths
friends
believe
that
he
accused
her
because
he
supposed
that
such
a
charge
would
be
agreeable
to
mary
and
that
he
should
himself
be
more
leniently
treated
in
consequence
of
it
but
that
when
at
last
he
found
that
sacrificing
her
would
not
save
him
his
guilty
conscience
scourged
him
into
doing
her
justice
in
his
last
hours
all
obstacles
to
the
wedding
were
now
apparently
removed
for
after
the
failure
of
wyatts
rebellion
nobody
dared
to
make
any
open
opposition
to
the
plans
of
the
queen
though
there
was
still
abundance
of
secret
dissatisfaction
mary
was
now
very
impatient
to
have
the
marriage
carried
into
effect
a
new
parliament
was
called
and
its
concurrence
in
the
plan
obtained
mary
ordered
a
squadron
of
ships
to
be
fitted
out
and
sent
to
spain
to
convey
the
bridegroom
to
england
the
admiral
who
had
command
of
this
fleet
wrote
to
her
that
the
sailors
were
so
hostile
to
philip
that
he
did
not
think
it
was
safe
for
her
to
intrust
him
to
their
hands
mary
then
commanded
this
force
to
be
dismissed
in
order
to
arrange
some
other
way
to
bring
philip
over
she
was
then
full
of
anxiety
and
apprehension
lest
some
accident
might
befall
him
his
ship
might
be
wrecked
or
he
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
french
who
were
not
at
all
well
disposed
toward
the
match
her
thoughts
and
her
conversation
were
running
upon
this
topic
all
the
time
she
was
restless
by
day
and
sleepless
by
night
until
her
health
was
at
last
seriously
impaired
and
her
friends
began
really
to
fear
that
she
might
lose
her
reason
she
was
very
anxious
too
lest
philip
should
find
her
beauty
so
impaired
by
her
years
and
by
the
state
of
her
health
that
she
should
fail
when
he
arrived
of
becoming
the
object
of
his
love
in
fact
she
complained
already
that
philip
neglected
her
he
did
not
write
to
her
or
express
in
any
way
the
interest
and
affection
which
she
thought
ought
to
be
awakened
in
his
mind
by
a
bride
who
as
she
expressed
it
was
going
to
bring
a
kingdom
for
a
dowry
this
sort
of
cold
and
haughty
demeanor
was
however
in
keeping
with
the
selfimportance
and
the
pride
which
then
often
marked
the
spanish
character
and
which
in
philip
particularly
always
seemed
to
be
extreme
at
length
the
time
arrived
for
his
embarkation
he
sailed
across
the
bay
of
biscay
and
up
the
english
channel
until
he
reached
southampton
a
famous
port
on
the
southern
coast
of
england
there
he
landed
with
great
pomp
and
parade
he
assumed
a
very
proud
and
stately
bearing
which
made
a
very
unfavorable
impression
upon
the
english
people
who
had
been
sent
by
queen
mary
to
receive
him
he
drew
his
sword
when
he
landed
and
walked
about
with
it
for
a
time
in
a
very
pompous
manner
holding
the
sword
unsheathed
in
his
hand
the
crowd
of
bystanders
that
had
collected
to
witness
the
spectacle
of
the
landing
looking
on
all
the
time
and
wondering
what
such
an
action
could
be
intended
to
intimate
it
was
probably
intended
simply
to
make
them
wonder
the
authorities
of
southampton
had
arranged
it
to
come
in
procession
to
meet
philip
and
present
him
with
the
keys
of
the
gates
an
emblem
of
an
honorable
reception
into
the
city
philip
received
the
keys
but
did
not
deign
a
word
of
reply
the
distance
and
reserve
which
it
had
been
customary
to
maintain
between
the
english
sovereigns
and
their
people
was
always
pretty
strongly
marked
but
philips
loftiness
and
grandeur
seemed
to
surpass
all
bounds
mary
went
two
thirds
of
the
way
from
london
to
the
coast
to
meet
the
bridegroom
here
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
and
the
whole
party
came
with
great
parade
and
rejoicings
back
to
london
and
mary
satisfied
and
happy
took
up
her
abode
with
her
new
lord
in
windsor
castle
the
poor
queen
was
however
in
the
end
sadly
disappointed
in
her
husband
he
felt
no
love
for
her
he
was
probably
in
fact
incapable
of
love
he
remained
in
england
a
year
and
then
growing
weary
of
his
wife
and
of
his
adopted
country
he
went
back
to
spain
again
greatly
to
queen
marys
vexation
and
chagrin
they
were
both
extremely
disappointed
in
not
having
children
philips
motive
for
marrying
mary
was
ambition
wholly
and
not
love
and
when
he
found
that
an
heir
to
inherit
the
two
kingdoms
was
not
to
be
expected
he
treated
his
unhappy
wife
with
great
neglect
and
cruelty
and
finally
went
away
from
her
altogether
he
came
back
again
it
is
true
a
year
afterward
but
it
was
only
to
compel
mary
to
join
with
him
in
a
war
against
france
he
told
her
that
if
she
would
not
do
this
he
would
go
away
from
england
and
never
see
her
again
mary
yielded
but
at
length
harassed
and
worn
down
with
useless
regrets
and
repinings
her
mental
sufferings
are
supposed
to
have
shortened
her
days
she
died
miserably
a
few
years
after
her
marriage
and
thus
the
spanish
match
turned
out
to
be
a
very
unfortunate
match

in

which
was
briefly
alluded
to
in
the
last
chapter
deserves
a
more
full
narration
than
was
possible
to
give
to
it
there
she
had
retired
from
court
some
time
before
the
difficulties
about
the
spanish
match
arose
it
is
true
that
she
took
sides
with
mary
in
the
contest
with
northumberland
and
the
friends
of
jane
grey
and
she
shared
her
royal
sisters
triumph
in
the
pomp
and
parade
of
the
coronation
but
after
all
she
and
mary
could
not
possibly
be
very
good
friends
the
marriages
of
their
respective
mothers
could
not
both
have
been
valid
henry
the
eighth
was
so
impatient
that
he
could
not
wait
for
a
divorce
from
catharine
before
he
married
anne
boleyn
the
only
way
to
make
the
latter
marriage
legal
therefore
was
to
consider
the
former
one
null
and
void
from
the
beginning
and
if
the
former
one
was
not
thus
null
and
void
the
latter
must
be
so
if
henry
had
waited
for
a
divorce
then
both
marriages
might
have
been
valid
each
for
the
time
of
its
own
continuance
and
both
the
princesses
might
have
been
lawful
heirs
but
as
it
was
neither
of
them
could
maintain
her
own
claims
to
be
considered
a
lawful
daughter
without
denying
by
implication
at
least
those
of
the
other
they
were
therefore
as
it
were
natural
enemies
though
they
might
be
outwardly
civil
to
each
other
it
was
not
possible
that
there
could
be
any
true
harmony
or
friendship
between
them
a
circumstance
occurred
too
soon
after
marys
accession
to
the
throne
which
resulted
in
openly
alienating
the
feelings
of
the
two
ladies
from
each
other
there
was
a
certain
prisoner
in
the
tower
of
london
a
gentleman
of
high
rank
and
great
consideration
named
courteney
now
about
twentysix
years
of
age
who
had
been
imprisoned
in
the
tower
by
king
henry
the
eighth
when
he
was
only
twelve
years
old
on
account
of
some
political
offenses
of
his
father
he
had
thus
been
a
close
prisoner
for
fourteen
years
at
marys
accession
but
mary
released
him
it
was
found
when
he
returned
to
society
again
that
he
had
employed
his
solitary
hours
in
cultivating
his
mind
acquiring
knowledge
and
availing
himself
of
all
the
opportunities
for
improvement
which
his
situation
afforded
and
that
he
came
forth
an
intelligent
accomplished
and
very
agreeable
man
the
interest
which
his
appearance
and
manners
excited
was
increased
by
the
sympathy
naturally
felt
for
the
sufferings
that
he
had
endured
in
a
word
he
became
a
general
favorite
the
rank
of
his
family
was
high
enough
for
mary
to
think
of
him
for
her
husband
for
this
was
before
the
spanish
match
was
thought
of
mary
granted
him
a
title
and
large
estates
and
showed
him
many
other
favors
and
as
every
body
supposed
tried
very
hard
to
make
an
impression
on
his
heart
her
efforts
were
however
vain
courteney
gave
an
obvious
preference
to
elizabeth
who
was
young
then
at
least
if
not
beautiful
this
successful
rivalry
on
the
part
of
her
sister
filled
the
queens
heart
with
resentment
and
envy
and
she
exhibited
her
chagrin
by
so
many
little
marks
of
neglect
and
incivility
that
elizabeths
resentment
was
roused
in
its
turn
and
she
asked
permission
to
retire
from
court
to
her
residence
in
the
country
mary
readily
gave
the
permission
and
thus
it
happened
that
when
wyatts
rebellion
first
broke
out
as
described
in
the
last
chapter
elizabeth
was
living
in
retirement
and
seclusion
at
ashridge
an
estate
of
hers
at
some
distance
west
of
london
as
to
courteney
mary
found
some
pretext
or
other
for
sending
him
back
again
to
his
prison
in
the
tower
mary
was
immediately
afraid
that
the
malcontents
would
join
with
elizabeth
and
attempt
to
put
forward
her
name
and
her
claims
to
the
crown
which
if
they
were
to
do
it
would
make
their
movement
very
formidable
she
was
impressed
immediately
with
the
idea
that
it
was
of
great
importance
to
get
elizabeth
back
again
into
her
power
the
most
probable
way
of
succeeding
in
doing
this
she
thought
was
to
write
her
a
kind
and
friendly
letter
inviting
her
to
return
she
accordingly
wrote
such
a
letter
she
said
in
it
that
certain
evildisposed
persons
were
plotting
some
disturbances
in
the
kingdom
and
that
she
thought
that
elizabeth
was
not
safe
where
she
was
she
urged
her
therefore
to
return
saying
that
she
should
be
truly
welcome
and
should
be
protected
against
all
danger
if
she
would
come
an
invitation
from
a
queen
is
a
command
and
elizabeth
would
have
felt
bound
to
obey
this
summons
but
she
was
sick
when
it
came
at
least
she
was
not
well
and
she
was
not
much
disposed
to
underrate
her
sickness
for
the
sake
of
being
able
to
travel
on
this
occasion
the
officers
of
her
household
made
out
a
formal
certificate
to
the
effect
that
elizabeth
was
not
able
to
undertake
such
a
journey
in
the
mean
time
wyatts
rebellion
broke
out
he
marched
to
london
was
entrapped
there
and
taken
prisoner
as
is
related
at
length
in
the
last
chapter
in
his
confessions
he
implicated
the
princess
elizabeth
and
also
courteney
and
marys
government
then
determined
that
they
must
secure
elizabeths
person
at
all
events
sick
or
well
they
sent
therefore
three
gentlemen
as
commissioners
with
a
troop
of
horse
to
attend
them
to
bring
her
to
london
they
carried
the
queens
litter
with
them
to
bring
the
princess
upon
it
in
case
she
should
be
found
unable
to
travel
in
any
other
way
this
party
arrived
at
ashridge
at
ten
oclock
at
night
they
insisted
on
being
admitted
at
once
into
the
chamber
of
elizabeth
and
there
they
made
known
their
errand
elizabeth
was
terrified
she
begged
not
to
be
moved
as
she
was
really
too
sick
to
go
they
called
in
some
physicians
who
certified
that
she
could
be
moved
without
danger
to
her
life
the
next
morning
they
put
her
upon
the
litter
a
sort
of
covered
bed
formed
like
a
palanquin
and
borne
like
a
palanquin
by
men
it
was
twentynine
miles
to
london
and
it
took
the
party
four
days
to
reach
the
city
they
moved
so
slowly
this
circumstance
is
mentioned
sometimes
as
showing
how
sick
elizabeth
must
have
been
but
the
fact
is
there
was
no
reason
whatever
for
any
haste
elizabeth
was
now
completely
in
marys
power
and
it
could
make
no
possible
difference
how
long
she
was
upon
the
road
the
litter
passed
along
the
roads
in
great
state
it
was
a
princess
that
they
were
bearing
as
they
approached
london
a
hundred
men
in
handsome
uniforms
went
before
and
an
equal
number
followed
a
great
many
people
came
out
from
the
city
to
meet
the
princess
as
a
token
of
respect
this
displeased
mary
but
it
could
not
well
be
prevented
or
punished
on
their
arrival
they
took
elizabeth
to
one
of
the
palaces
at
westminster
called
whitehall
she
was
examined
by
marys
privy
council
nothing
was
proved
against
her
and
as
the
rebellion
seemed
now
wholly
at
an
end
she
was
at
length
released
and
thus
ended
her
first
durance
as
a
political
prisoner
it
happened
however
that
other
persons
implicated
in
wyatts
plot
when
examined
made
charges
against
elizabeth
in
respect
to
it
and
queen
mary
sent
another
force
and
arrested
her
again
she
was
taken
now
to
a
famous
royal
palace
called
hampton
court
which
is
situated
on
the
thames
a
few
miles
above
the
city
she
brought
many
of
the
officers
of
her
household
and
of
her
personal
attendants
with
her
but
one
of
the
queens
ministers
accompanied
by
two
other
officers
came
soon
after
and
dismissed
all
her
own
attendants
and
placed
persons
in
the
service
of
the
queen
in
their
place
they
also
set
a
guard
around
the
palace
and
then
left
the
princess
for
the
night
a
close
prisoner
and
yet
without
any
visible
signs
of
coercion
for
all
these
guards
might
be
guards
of
honor
the
next
day
some
officers
came
again
and
told
her
that
it
had
been
decided
to
send
her
to
the
tower
and
that
a
barge
was
ready
at
the
river
to
convey
her
she
was
very
much
agitated
and
alarmed
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
send
a
letter
to
her
sister
before
they
took
her
away
one
of
the
officers
insisted
that
she
should
have
the
privilege
and
the
other
that
she
should
not
the
former
conquered
in
the
contest
and
elizabeth
wrote
the
letter
and
sent
it
it
contained
an
earnest
and
solemn
disavowal
of
all
participation
in
the
plots
which
she
had
been
charged
with
encouraging
and
begged
mary
to
believe
that
she
was
innocent
and
allow
her
to
be
released
the
letter
did
no
good
elizabeth
was
taken
into
the
barge
and
conveyed
in
a
very
private
manner
down
the
river
hampton
court
is
above
london
several
miles
and
the
tower
is
just
below
the
city
there
are
several
entrances
to
this
vast
castle
some
of
them
by
stairs
from
the
river
among
these
is
one
by
which
prisoners
accused
of
great
political
crimes
were
usually
taken
in
and
which
is
called
the
traitors
gate
there
was
another
entrance
also
from
the
river
by
which
a
more
honorable
admission
to
the
fortress
might
be
attained
the
tower
was
not
solely
a
prison
it
was
often
a
place
of
retreat
for
kings
and
queens
from
any
sudden
danger
and
was
frequently
occupied
by
them
as
a
somewhat
permanent
residence
there
were
a
great
number
of
structures
within
the
walls
in
some
of
which
royal
apartments
were
fitted
up
with
great
splendor
elizabeth
had
often
been
in
the
tower
as
a
resident
or
a
visitor
and
thus
far
there
was
nothing
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
to
forbid
the
supposition
that
they
might
be
taking
her
there
as
a
guest
or
resident
now
she
was
anxious
and
uneasy
it
is
true
but
she
was
not
certain
that
she
was
regarded
as
a
prisoner
in
the
mean
time
the
barge
with
the
other
boats
in
attendance
passed
down
the
river
in
the
rain
for
it
was
a
stormy
day
a
circumstance
which
aided
the
authorities
in
their
effort
to
convey
their
captive
to
her
gloomy
prison
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
populace
besides
it
was
the
day
of
some
great
religious
festival
when
the
people
were
generally
in
the
churches
this
day
had
been
chosen
on
that
very
account
the
barge
and
the
boats
came
down
the
river
therefore
without
attracting
much
attention
they
approached
the
landingplace
at
last
and
stopped
at
the
flight
of
steps
leading
up
from
the
water
to
the
traitors
gate
elizabeth
declared
that
she
was
no
traitor
and
that
she
would
not
be
landed
there
the
nobleman
who
had
charge
of
her
told
her
simply
in
reply
that
she
could
not
have
her
choice
of
a
place
to
land
at
the
same
time
he
offered
her
his
cloak
to
protect
her
from
the
rain
in
passing
from
the
barge
to
the
castle
gate
umbrellas
had
not
been
invented
in
those
days
elizabeth
threw
the
cloak
away
from
her
in
vexation
and
anger
she
found
however
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
resist
she
could
not
choose
she
stepped
from
the
barge
out
upon
the
stairs
in
the
rain
saying
as
she
did
so
here
lands
as
true
and
faithful
a
subject
as
ever
landed
a
prisoner
at
these
stairs
before
thee
o
god
i
speak
it
having
now
no
friends
but
thee
alone
a
large
company
of
the
warders
and
keepers
of
the
castle
had
been
drawn
up
at
the
traitors
gate
to
receive
her
as
was
customary
on
occasions
when
prisoners
of
high
rank
were
to
enter
the
tower
as
these
men
were
always
dressed
in
uniform
of
a
peculiar
antique
character
such
a
parade
of
them
made
quite
an
imposing
appearance
elizabeth
asked
what
it
meant
they
told
her
that
that
was
the
customary
mode
of
receiving
a
prisoner
she
said
that
if
it
was
she
hoped
that
they
would
dispense
with
the
ceremony
in
her
case
and
asked
that
for
her
sake
the
men
might
be
dismissed
from
such
attendance
in
so
inclement
a
season
the
men
blessed
her
for
her
goodness
and
kneeled
down
and
prayed
that
god
would
preserve
her
she
was
extremely
unwilling
to
go
into
the
prison
as
they
approached
the
part
of
the
edifice
where
she
was
to
be
confined
through
the
courtyard
of
the
tower
she
stopped
and
sat
down
upon
a
stone
perhaps
a
step
or
the
curb
stone
of
a
walk
the
lieutenant
urged
her
to
go
in
out
of
the
cold
and
wet
better
sitting
here
than
in
a
worse
place
she
replied
for
god
knoweth
whither
you
are
bringing
me
however
she
rose
and
went
on
she
entered
the
prison
was
conducted
to
her
room
and
the
doors
were
locked
and
bolted
upon
her
elizabeth
was
kept
closely
imprisoned
for
a
month
after
that
some
little
relaxation
in
the
strictness
of
her
seclusion
was
allowed
permission
was
very
reluctantly
granted
to
her
to
walk
every
day
in
the
royal
apartments
which
were
now
unoccupied
so
that
there
was
no
society
to
be
found
there
but
it
afforded
her
a
sort
of
pleasure
to
range
through
them
for
recreation
and
exercise
but
this
privilege
could
not
be
accorded
without
very
strict
limitations
and
conditions
two
officers
of
the
tower
and
three
women
had
to
attend
her
the
windows
too
were
shut
and
she
was
not
permitted
to
go
and
look
out
at
them
this
was
rather
melancholy
recreation
it
must
be
allowed
but
it
was
better
than
being
shut
up
all
day
in
a
single
apartment
bolted
and
barred
illustration
elizabeth
in
the
tower
there
was
a
small
garden
within
the
castle
not
far
from
the
prison
and
after
some
time
elizabeth
was
permitted
to
walk
there
the
gates
and
doors
however
were
kept
carefully
closed
and
all
the
prisoners
whose
rooms
looked
into
it
from
the
surrounding
buildings
were
closely
watched
by
their
respective
keepers
while
elizabeth
was
in
the
garden
to
prevent
their
having
any
communication
with
her
by
looks
or
signs
there
were
a
great
many
persons
confined
at
this
time
who
had
been
arrested
on
charges
connected
with
wyatts
rebellion
and
the
authorities
seem
to
have
been
very
specially
vigilant
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
elizabeths
having
communication
with
any
of
them
there
was
a
little
child
of
five
years
of
age
who
used
to
come
and
visit
elizabeth
in
her
room
and
bring
her
flowers
he
was
the
son
of
one
of
the
subordinate
officers
of
the
tower
it
was
however
at
last
suspected
that
he
was
acting
as
a
messenger
between
elizabeth
and
courteney
courteney
it
will
be
recollected
had
been
sent
by
mary
back
to
the
tower
again
so
that
he
and
elizabeth
were
now
suffering
the
same
hard
fate
in
neighboring
cells
when
the
boy
was
suspected
of
bearing
communications
between
these
friends
and
companions
in
suffering
he
was
called
before
an
officer
and
closely
examined
his
answers
were
all
open
and
childlike
and
gave
no
confirmation
to
the
idea
which
had
been
entertained
the
child
however
was
forbidden
to
go
to
elizabeths
apartment
any
more
he
was
very
much
grieved
at
this
and
he
watched
for
the
next
time
that
elizabeth
was
to
walk
in
the
garden
and
putting
his
mouth
to
a
hole
in
the
gate
he
called
out
lady
i
can
not
bring
you
any
more
flowers
after
elizabeth
had
been
thus
confined
about
three
months
she
was
one
day
terribly
alarmed
by
the
sounds
of
martial
parade
within
the
tower
produced
by
the
entrance
of
an
officer
from
queen
mary
named
sir
thomas
beddingfield
at
the
head
of
three
hundred
men
elizabeth
supposed
that
they
were
come
to
execute
sentence
of
death
upon
her
she
asked
immediately
if
the
platform
on
which
lady
jane
grey
was
beheaded
had
been
taken
away
they
told
her
that
it
had
been
removed
she
was
then
somewhat
relieved
they
afterward
told
her
that
sir
thomas
had
come
to
take
her
away
from
the
tower
but
that
it
was
not
known
where
she
was
to
go
this
alarmed
her
again
and
she
sent
for
the
constable
of
the
tower
whose
name
was
lord
chandos
and
questioned
him
very
closely
to
learn
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
her
he
said
that
it
had
been
decided
to
remove
her
from
the
tower
and
send
her
to
a
place
called
woodstock
where
she
was
to
remain
under
sir
thomas
beddingfields
custody
at
a
royal
palace
which
was
situated
there
woodstock
is
forty
or
fifty
miles
to
the
westward
of
london
and
not
far
from
the
city
of
oxford
elizabeth
was
very
much
alarmed
at
this
intelligence
her
mind
was
filled
with
vague
and
uncertain
fears
and
forebodings
which
were
none
the
less
oppressive
for
being
uncertain
and
vague
she
had
however
no
immediate
cause
for
apprehension
mary
found
that
there
was
no
decisive
evidence
against
her
and
did
not
dare
to
keep
her
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
too
long
there
was
a
large
and
influential
part
of
the
kingdom
who
were
protestants
they
were
jealous
of
the
progress
mary
was
making
toward
bringing
the
catholic
religion
in
again
they
abhorred
the
spanish
match
they
naturally
looked
to
elizabeth
as
their
leader
and
head
and
mary
thought
that
by
too
great
or
too
longcontinued
harshness
in
her
treatment
of
elizabeth
she
would
only
exasperate
them
and
perhaps
provoke
a
new
outbreak
against
her
authority
she
determined
therefore
to
remove
the
princess
from
the
tower
to
some
less
odious
place
of
confinement
she
was
taken
first
to
queen
marys
court
which
was
then
held
at
richmond
just
above
london
but
she
was
surrounded
here
by
soldiers
and
guards
and
confined
almost
as
strictly
as
before
she
was
destined
however
here
to
another
surprise
it
was
a
proposition
of
marriage
mary
had
been
arranging
a
plan
for
making
her
the
wife
of
a
certain
personage
styled
the
duke
of
savoy
his
dominions
were
on
the
confines
of
switzerland
and
france
and
mary
thought
that
if
her
rival
were
once
married
and
removed
there
all
the
troubles
which
she
mary
had
experienced
on
her
account
would
be
ended
forever
she
thought
too
that
her
sister
would
be
glad
to
accept
this
offer
which
opened
such
an
immediate
escape
from
the
embarrassments
and
sufferings
of
her
situation
in
england
but
elizabeth
was
prompt
decided
and
firm
in
the
rejection
of
this
plan
england
was
her
home
and
to
be
queen
of
england
the
end
and
aim
of
all
her
wishes
and
plans
she
had
rather
continue
a
captive
for
the
present
in
her
native
land
than
to
live
in
splendor
as
the
consort
of
a
sovereign
duke
beyond
the
rhone
mary
then
ordered
sir
thomas
beddingfield
to
take
her
to
woodstock
she
traveled
on
horseback
and
was
several
days
on
the
journey
her
passage
through
the
country
attracted
great
attention
the
people
assembled
by
the
wayside
expressing
their
kind
wishes
and
offering
her
gifts
the
bells
were
rung
in
the
villages
through
which
she
passed
she
arrived
finally
at
woodstock
and
was
shut
up
in
the
palace
there
this
was
in
july
and
she
remained
in
woodstock
more
than
a
year
not
however
always
very
closely
confined
at
christmas
she
was
taken
to
court
and
allowed
to
share
in
the
festivities
and
rejoicings
on
this
occasionit
was
the
first
christmas
after
the
marriage
of
mary
and
philipthe
great
hall
of
the
palace
was
illuminated
with
a
thousand
lamps
the
princess
sat
at
table
next
to
the
king
and
queen
she
was
on
other
occasions
too
taken
away
for
a
time
and
then
returned
again
to
her
seclusion
at
woodstock
these
changes
perhaps
only
served
to
make
her
feel
more
than
ever
the
hardships
of
her
lot
they
say
that
one
day
as
she
sat
at
her
window
she
heard
a
milkmaid
singing
in
the
fields
in
a
blithe
and
merry
strain
and
said
with
a
sigh
that
she
wished
she
was
a
milkmaid
too
king
philip
after
his
marriage
gradually
interested
himself
in
her
behalf
and
exerted
his
influence
to
have
her
released
and
marys
ministers
had
frequent
interviews
with
her
and
endeavored
to
induce
her
to
make
some
confession
of
guilt
and
to
petition
mary
for
release
as
a
matter
of
mercy
they
could
not
they
said
release
her
while
she
persisted
in
her
innocence
without
admitting
that
they
and
mary
had
been
in
the
wrong
and
had
imprisoned
her
unjustly
but
the
princess
was
immovable
she
declared
that
she
was
perfectly
innocent
and
that
she
would
never
therefore
say
that
she
was
guilty
she
would
rather
remain
in
prison
for
the
truth
than
be
at
liberty
and
have
it
believed
that
she
had
been
guilty
of
disloyalty
and
treason
at
length
one
evening
in
may
elizabeth
received
a
summons
to
go
to
the
palace
and
visit
mary
in
her
chamber
she
was
conducted
there
by
torchlight
she
had
a
long
interview
with
the
queen
the
conversation
being
partly
in
english
and
partly
in
spanish
it
was
not
very
satisfactory
on
either
side
elizabeth
persisted
in
asserting
her
innocence
but
in
other
respects
she
spoke
in
a
kind
and
conciliatory
manner
to
the
queen
the
interview
ended
in
a
sort
of
reconciliation
mary
put
a
valuable
ring
upon
elizabeths
finger
in
token
of
the
renewal
of
friendship
and
soon
afterward
the
long
period
of
restraint
and
confinement
was
ended
and
the
princess
returned
to
her
own
estate
at
hatfield
in
hertfordshire
where
she
lived
some
time
in
seclusion
devoting
herself
in
a
great
measure
to
the
study
of
latin
and

if

were
the
story
of

instead
of
that
of
elizabeth
that
we
were
following
we
should
have
now
to
pause
and
draw
a
very
melancholy
picture
of
the
scenes
which
darkened
the
close
of
the
queens
unfortunate
and
unhappy
history
mary
loved
her
husband
but
she
could
not
secure
his
love
in
return
he
treated
her
with
supercilious
coldness
and
neglect
and
evinced
from
time
to
time
a
degree
of
interest
in
other
ladies
which
awakened
her
jealousy
and
anger
of
all
the
terrible
convulsions
to
which
the
human
soul
is
subject
there
is
not
one
which
agitates
it
more
deeply
than
the
tumult
of
feeling
produced
by
the
mingling
of
resentment
and
love
such
a
mingling
or
rather
such
a
conflict
between
passions
apparently
inconsistent
with
each
other
is
generally
considered
not
possible
by
those
who
have
never
experienced
it
but
it
is
possible
it
is
possible
to
be
stung
with
a
sense
of
the
ingratitude
and
selfishness
and
cruelty
of
an
object
which
after
all
the
heart
will
persist
in
clinging
to
with
the
fondest
affection
vexation
and
anger
a
burning
sense
of
injury
and
desire
for
revenge
on
the
one
hand
and
feelings
of
love
resistless
and
uncontrollable
and
bearing
in
their
turn
all
before
them
alternately
get
possession
of
the
soul
harrowing
and
devastating
it
in
their
awful
conflict
and
even
sometimes
reigning
over
it
for
a
time
in
a
temporary
but
dreadful
calm
like
that
of
two
wrestlers
who
pause
a
moment
exhausted
in
a
mortal
combat
but
grappling
each
other
with
deadly
energy
all
the
time
while
they
are
taking
breath
for
a
renewal
of
the
conflict
queen
mary
in
one
of
these
paroxysms
seized
a
portrait
of
her
husband
and
tore
it
into
shreds
the
reader
who
has
his
or
her
experience
in
affairs
of
the
heart
yet
to
come
will
say
perhaps
her
love
for
him
then
must
have
been
all
gone
no
it
was
at
its
height
we
do
not
tear
the
portraits
of
those
who
are
indifferent
to
us
at
the
beginning
of
her
reign
and
in
fact
during
all
the
previous
periods
of
her
life
mary
had
been
an
honest
and
conscientious
catholic
she
undoubtedly
truly
believed
that
the
christian
church
ought
to
be
banded
together
in
one
great
communion
with
the
pope
of
rome
as
its
spiritual
head
and
that
her
father
had
broken
away
from
this
communionwhich
was
in
fact
strictly
truemerely
to
obtain
a
pretext
for
getting
released
from
her
mother
how
natural
under
such
circumstances
that
she
should
have
desired
to
return
she
commenced
immediately
on
her
accession
a
course
of
measures
to
bring
the
nation
back
to
the
roman
catholic
communion
she
managed
very
prudently
and
cautiously
at
firstespecially
while
the
affair
of
her
marriage
was
pendingseemingly
very
desirous
of
doing
nothing
to
exasperate
those
who
were
of
the
protestant
faith
or
even
to
awaken
their
opposition
after
she
was
married
however
her
desire
to
please
her
catholic
husband
and
his
widelyextended
and
influential
circle
of
catholic
friends
on
the
continent
made
her
more
eager
to
press
forward
the
work
of
putting
down
the
reformation
in
england
and
as
her
marriage
was
now
effected
she
was
less
concerned
about
the
consequences
of
any
opposition
which
she
might
excite
then
besides
her
temper
never
very
sweet
was
sadly
soured
by
her
husbands
treatment
of
her
she
vented
her
ill
will
upon
those
who
would
not
yield
to
her
wishes
in
respect
to
their
religious
faith
she
caused
more
and
more
severe
laws
to
be
passed
and
enforced
them
by
more
and
more
severe
penalties
the
more
she
pressed
these
violent
measures
the
more
the
fortitude
and
resolution
of
those
who
suffered
from
them
were
aroused
and
on
the
other
hand
the
more
they
resisted
the
more
determined
she
became
that
she
would
compel
them
to
submit
she
went
on
from
one
mode
of
coercion
to
another
until
she
reached
the
last
possible
point
and
inflicted
the
most
dreadful
physical
suffering
which
it
is
possible
for
man
to
inflict
upon
his
fellowman
this
worst
and
most
terrible
injury
is
to
burn
the
living
victim
in
a
fire
that
a
woman
could
ever
order
this
to
be
done
would
seem
to
be
incredible
queen
mary
however
and
her
government
were
so
determined
to
put
down
at
all
hazards
all
open
disaffection
to
the
catholic
cause
that
they
did
not
give
up
the
contest
until
they
had
burned
nearly
three
hundred
persons
by
fire
of
whom
more
than
fifty
were
women
and
four
were
children
this
horrible
persecution
was
however
of
no
avail
dissentients
increased
faster
than
they
could
be
burned
and
such
dreadful
punishments
became
at
last
so
intolerably
odious
to
the
nation
that
they
were
obliged
to
desist
and
then
the
various
ministers
of
state
concerned
in
them
attempted
to
throw
off
the
blame
upon
each
other
the
english
nation
have
never
forgiven
mary
for
these
atrocities
they
gave
her
the
name
of
bloody
mary
at
the
time
and
she
has
retained
it
to
the
present
day
in
one
of
the
ancient
histories
of
the
realm
at
the
head
of
the
chapter
devoted
to
mary
there
is
placed
as
an
appropriate
emblem
of
the
character
of
her
reign
the
picture
of
a
man
writhing
helplessly
at
a
stake
with
the
flames
curling
around
him
and
a
ferociouslooking
soldier
standing
by
stirring
up
the
fire
the
various
disappointments
vexations
and
trials
which
mary
endured
toward
the
close
of
her
life
had
one
good
effect
they
softened
the
animosity
which
she
had
felt
toward
elizabeth
and
in
the
end
something
like
a
friendship
seemed
to
spring
up
between
the
sisters
abandoned
by
her
husband
and
looked
upon
with
dislike
or
hatred
by
her
subjects
and
disappointed
in
all
her
plans
she
seemed
to
turn
at
last
to
elizabeth
for
companionship
and
comfort
the
sisters
visited
each
other
first
elizabeth
went
to
london
to
visit
the
queen
and
was
received
with
great
ceremony
and
parade
then
the
queen
went
to
hatfield
to
visit
the
princess
attended
by
a
large
company
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
court
and
several
days
were
spent
there
in
festivities
and
rejoicings
there
were
plays
in
the
palace
and
a
bearbaiting
in
the
courtyard
and
hunting
in
the
park
and
many
other
schemes
of
pleasure
this
renewal
of
friendly
intercourse
between
the
queen
and
the
princess
brought
the
latter
gradually
out
of
her
retirement
now
that
the
queen
began
to
evince
a
friendly
spirit
toward
her
it
was
safe
for
others
to
show
her
kindness
and
to
pay
her
attention
the
disposition
to
do
this
increased
rapidly
as
marys
health
gradually
declined
and
it
began
to
be
understood
that
she
would
not
live
long
and
that
consequently
elizabeth
would
soon
be
called
to
the
throne
the
war
which
mary
had
been
drawn
into
with
france
by
philips
threat
that
he
would
never
see
her
again
proved
very
disastrous
the
town
of
calais
which
is
opposite
to
dover
across
the
straits
and
of
course
on
the
french
side
of
the
channel
had
been
in
the
possession
of
the
english
for
two
hundred
years
it
was
very
gratifying
to
english
pride
to
hold
possession
of
such
a
stronghold
on
the
french
shore
but
now
every
thing
seemed
to
go
against
mary
calais
was
defended
by
a
citadel
nearly
as
large
as
the
town
itself
and
was
deemed
impregnable
in
addition
to
this
an
enormous
english
force
was
concentrated
there
the
french
general
however
contrived
partly
by
stratagem
and
partly
by
overpowering
numbers
of
troops
and
ships
and
batteries
of
cannon
to
get
possession
of
the
whole
the
english
nation
were
indignant
at
this
result
their
queen
and
her
government
so
energetic
in
imprisoning
and
burning
her
own
subjects
at
home
were
powerless
it
seemed
in
coping
with
their
enemies
abroad
murmurs
of
dissatisfaction
were
heard
every
where
and
mary
sank
down
upon
her
sick
bed
overwhelmed
with
disappointment
vexation
and
chagrin
she
said
that
she
should
die
and
that
if
after
her
death
they
examined
her
body
they
would
find
calais
like
a
load
upon
her
heart
in
the
mean
time
it
must
have
been
elizabeths
secret
wish
that
she
would
die
since
her
death
would
release
the
princess
from
all
the
embarrassments
and
restraints
of
her
position
and
raise
her
at
once
to
the
highest
pinnacle
of
honor
and
power
she
remained
however
quietly
at
hatfield
acting
in
all
things
in
a
very
discreet
and
cautious
manner
at
one
time
she
received
proposals
from
the
king
of
sweden
that
she
would
accept
of
his
son
as
her
husband
she
asked
the
embassador
if
he
had
communicated
the
affair
to
mary
on
his
replying
that
he
had
not
elizabeth
said
that
she
could
not
entertain
at
all
any
such
question
unless
her
sister
were
first
consulted
and
should
give
her
approbation
she
acted
on
the
same
principles
in
every
thing
being
very
cautious
to
give
mary
and
her
government
no
cause
of
complaint
against
her
and
willing
to
wait
patiently
until
her
own
time
should
come
though
marys
disappointments
and
losses
filled
her
mind
with
anguish
and
suffering
they
did
not
soften
her
heart
she
seemed
to
grow
more
cruel
and
vindictive
the
more
her
plans
and
projects
failed
adversity
vexed
and
irritated
instead
of
calming
and
subduing
her
she
revived
her
persecutions
of
the
protestants
she
fitted
out
a
fleet
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
ships
to
make
a
descent
upon
the
french
coast
and
attempt
to
retrieve
her
fallen
fortunes
there
she
called
parliament
together
and
asked
for
more
supplies
all
this
time
she
was
confined
to
her
sick
chamber
but
not
considered
in
danger
the
parliament
were
debating
the
question
of
supplies
her
privy
council
were
holding
daily
meetings
to
carry
out
the
plans
and
schemes
which
she
still
continued
to
form
and
all
was
excitement
and
bustle
in
and
around
the
court
when
one
day
the
council
was
thunderstruck
by
an
announcement
that
she
was
dying
they
knew
very
well
that
her
death
would
be
a
terrible
blow
to
them
they
were
all
catholics
and
had
been
marys
instruments
in
the
terrible
persecutions
with
which
she
had
oppressed
the
protestant
faith
with
marys
death
of
course
they
would
fall
a
protestant
princess
was
ready
at
hatfield
to
ascend
the
throne
every
thing
would
be
changed
and
there
was
even
danger
that
they
might
in
their
turn
be
sent
to
the
stake
in
retaliation
for
the
cruelties
which
they
had
caused
others
to
suffer
they
made
arrangements
to
have
marys
death
whenever
it
should
take
place
concealed
for
a
few
hours
till
they
could
consider
what
they
should
do
there
was
nothing
that
they
could
do
there
was
now
no
other
considerable
claimant
to
the
throne
but
elizabeth
except
mary
queen
of
scots
who
was
far
away
in
france
she
was
a
catholic
it
was
true
but
to
bring
her
into
the
country
and
place
her
upon
the
throne
seemed
to
be
a
hopeless
undertaking
queen
marys
counselors
soon
found
that
they
must
give
up
their
cause
in
despair
any
attempt
to
resist
elizabeths
claims
would
be
high
treason
and
of
course
if
unsuccessful
would
bring
the
heads
of
all
concerned
in
it
to
the
block
besides
it
was
not
certain
that
elizabeth
would
act
decidedly
as
a
protestant
she
had
been
very
prudent
and
cautious
during
marys
reign
and
had
been
very
careful
never
to
manifest
any
hostility
to
the
catholics
she
never
had
acted
as
mary
had
done
on
the
occasion
of
her
brothers
funeral
when
she
refused
even
to
countenance
with
her
presence
the
national
service
because
it
was
under
protestant
forms
elizabeth
had
always
accompanied
mary
to
mass
whenever
occasion
required
she
had
always
spoken
respectfully
of
the
catholic
faith
and
once
she
asked
mary
to
lend
her
some
catholic
books
in
order
that
she
might
inform
herself
more
fully
on
the
subject
of
the
principles
of
the
roman
faith
it
is
true
she
acted
thus
not
because
there
was
any
real
leaning
in
her
mind
toward
the
catholic
religion
it
was
all
merely
a
wise
and
sagacious
policy
surrounded
by
difficulties
and
dangers
as
she
was
during
marys
reign
her
only
hope
of
safety
was
in
passing
as
quietly
as
possible
along
and
managing
warily
so
as
to
keep
the
hostility
which
was
burning
secretly
against
her
from
breaking
out
into
an
open
flame
this
was
her
object
in
retiring
so
much
from
the
court
and
from
all
participation
in
public
affairs
in
avoiding
all
religious
and
political
contests
and
spending
her
time
in
the
study
of
greek
and
latin
and
philosophy
the
consequence
was
that
when
mary
died
nobody
knew
certainly
what
course
elizabeth
would
pursue
nobody
had
any
strong
motive
for
opposing
her
succession
the
council
therefore
after
a
short
consultation
concluded
to
do
nothing
but
simply
to
send
a
message
to
the
house
of
lords
announcing
to
them
the
unexpected
death
of
the
queen
the
house
of
lords
on
receiving
this
intelligence
sent
for
the
commons
to
come
into
their
hall
as
is
usual
when
any
important
communication
is
to
be
made
to
them
either
by
the
lords
themselves
or
by
the
sovereign
the
chancellor
who
is
the
highest
civil
officer
of
the
kingdom
in
respect
to
rank
and
who
presides
in
the
house
of
lords
clothed
in
a
magnificent
antique
costume
then
rose
and
announced
to
the
commons
standing
before
him
the
death
of
the
sovereign
there
was
a
moments
solemn
pause
such
as
propriety
on
the
occasion
of
an
announcement
like
this
required
all
thoughts
being
too
for
a
moment
turned
to
the
chamber
where
the
body
of
the
departed
queen
was
lying
but
the
sovereignty
was
no
longer
there
the
mysterious
principle
had
fled
with
the
parting
breath
and
elizabeth
though
wholly
unconscious
of
it
had
been
for
several
hours
the
queen
the
thoughts
therefore
of
the
august
and
solemn
assembly
lingered
but
for
a
moment
in
the
royal
palace
which
had
now
lost
all
its
glory
they
soon
turned
spontaneously
and
with
eager
haste
to
the
new
sovereign
at
hatfield
and
the
lofty
arches
of
the
parliament
hall
rung
with
loud
acclamations
god
save
queen
elizabeth
and
grant
her
a
long
and
happy
reign
the
members
of
the
parliament
went
forth
immediately
to
proclaim
the
new
queen
there
are
two
principal
places
where
it
was
then
customary
to
proclaim
the
english
sovereigns
one
of
these
was
before
the
royal
palace
at
westminster
and
the
other
in
the
city
of
london
at
a
very
public
place
called
the
great
cross
at
cheapside
the
people
assembled
in
great
crowds
at
these
points
to
witness
the
ceremony
and
received
the
announcement
which
the
heralds
made
with
the
most
ardent
expressions
of
joy
the
bells
were
every
where
rung
tables
were
spread
in
the
streets
and
booths
erected
bonfires
and
illuminations
were
prepared
for
the
evening
and
every
thing
indicated
a
deep
and
universal
joy
in
fact
this
joy
was
so
strongly
expressed
as
to
be
even
in
some
degree
disrespectful
to
the
memory
of
the
departed
queen
there
is
a
famous
ancient
latin
hymn
which
has
long
been
sung
in
england
and
on
the
continent
of
europe
on
occasions
of
great
public
rejoicing
it
is
called
the
te
deum
or
sometimes
the
te
deum
laudamus
these
last
are
the
three
latin
words
with
which
the
hymn
commences
and
mean
thee
god
we
praise
they
sung
the
te
deum
in
the
churches
of
london
on
the
sunday
after
mary
died
in
the
mean
time
messengers
from
the
council
proceeded
with
all
speed
to
hatfield
to
announce
to
elizabeth
the
death
of
her
sister
and
her
own
accession
to
the
sovereign
power
the
tidings
of
course
filled
elizabeths
mind
with
the
deepest
emotions
the
oppressive
sense
of
constraint
and
danger
which
she
had
endured
as
her
daily
burden
for
so
many
years
was
lifted
suddenly
from
her
soul
she
could
not
but
rejoice
though
she
was
too
much
upon
her
guard
to
express
her
joy
she
was
overwhelmed
with
a
profound
agitation
and
kneeling
down
she
exclaimed
in
latin
it
is
the
lords
doing
and
it
is
wonderful
in
our
eyes
several
of
the
members
of
marys
privy
council
repaired
immediately
to
hatfield
the
queen
summoned
them
to
attend
her
and
in
their
presence
appointed
her
chief
secretary
of
state
his
name
was
sir
william
cecil
he
was
a
man
of
great
learning
and
ability
and
he
remained
in
office
under
elizabeth
for
forty
years
he
became
her
chief
adviser
and
instrument
an
able
faithful
and
indefatigable
servant
and
friend
during
almost
the
whole
of
her
reign
his
name
is
accordingly
indissolubly
connected
with
that
of
elizabeth
in
all
the
political
events
which
occurred
while
she
continued
upon
the
throne
and
it
will
in
consequence
very
frequently
occur
in
the
sequel
of
this
history
he
was
now
about
forty
years
of
age
elizabeth
was
twentyfive
elizabeth
had
known
cecil
long
before
he
had
been
a
faithful
and
true
friend
to
her
in
her
adversity
he
had
been
in
many
cases
a
confidential
adviser
and
had
maintained
a
secret
correspondence
with
her
in
certain
trying
periods
of
her
life
she
had
resolved
doubtless
to
make
him
her
chief
secretary
of
state
so
soon
as
she
should
succeed
to
the
throne
and
now
that
the
time
had
arrived
she
instated
him
solemnly
in
his
office
in
so
doing
she
pronounced
in
the
hearing
of
the
other
members
of
the
council
the
following
charge
i
give
you
this
charge
that
you
shall
be
of
my
privy
council
and
content
yourself
to
take
pains
for
me
and
my
realm
this
judgment
i
have
of
you
that
you
will
not
be
corrupted
with
any
gift
and
that
you
will
be
faithful
to
the
state
and
that
without
respect
of
my
private
will
you
will
give
me
that
counsel
that
you
think
best
and
that
if
you
shall
know
any
thing
necessary
to
be
declared
to
me
of
secrecy
you
shall
show
it
to
myself
only
and
assure
yourself
i
will
not
fail
to
keep
taciturnity
therein
and
therefore
herewith
i
charge

illustration
elizabeths
progress
to
london
it
was
about
a
week
after
the
death
of
mary
before
the
arrangements
were
completed
for
elizabeths
journey
to
london
to
take
possession
of
the
castles
and
palaces
which
pertain
there
to
the
english
sovereigns
she
was
followed
on
this
journey
by
a
train
of
about
a
thousand
attendants
all
nobles
or
personages
of
high
rank
both
gentlemen
and
ladies
she
went
first
to
a
palace
called
the
charter
house
near
london
where
she
stopped
until
preparations
could
be
made
for
her
formal
and
public
entrance
into
the
tower
not
as
before
through
the
traitors
gate
a
prisoner
but
openly
through
the
grand
entrance
in
the
midst
of
acclamations
as
the
proud
and
applauded
sovereign
of
the
mighty
realm
whose
capital
the
ancient
fortress
was
stationed
to
defend
the
streets
through
which
the
gorgeous
procession
was
to
pass
were
spread
with
fine
smooth
gravel
bands
of
musicians
were
stationed
at
intervals
and
decorated
arches
and
banners
and
flags
with
countless
devices
of
loyalty
and
welcome
and
waving
handkerchiefs
greeted
her
all
the
way
heralds
and
other
great
officers
magnificently
dressed
and
mounted
on
horses
richly
caparisoned
rode
before
her
announcing
her
approach
with
trumpets
and
proclamations
while
she
followed
in
the
train
mounted
upon
a
beautiful
horse
the
object
of
universal
homage
thus
elizabeth
entered
the
tower
and
inasmuch
as
forgetting
her
friends
is
a
fault
with
which
she
can
not
justly
be
charged
we
may
hope
at
least
that
one
of
the
first
acts
which
she
performed
after
getting
established
in
the
royal
apartments
was
to
send
for
and
reward
the
kindhearted
child
who
had
been
reprimanded
for
bringing
her
the
flowers
the
coronation
when
the
time
arrived
for
it
was
very
splendid
the
queen
went
in
state
in
a
sumptuous
chariot
preceded
by
trumpeters
and
heralds
in
armor
and
accompanied
by
a
long
train
of
noblemen
barons
and
gentlemen
and
also
of
ladies
all
most
richly
dressed
in
crimson
velvet
the
trappings
of
the
horses
being
of
the
same
material
the
people
of
london
thronged
all
the
streets
through
which
she
was
to
pass
and
made
the
air
resound
with
shouts
and
acclamations
there
were
triumphal
arches
erected
here
and
there
on
the
way
with
a
great
variety
of
odd
and
quaint
devices
and
a
child
stationed
upon
each
who
explained
the
devices
to
elizabeth
as
she
passed
in
english
verse
written
for
the
occasion
one
of
these
pageants
was
entitled
the
seat
of
worthy
governance
there
was
a
throne
supported
by
figures
which
represented
the
cardinal
virtues
such
as
piety
wisdom
temperance
industry
truth
and
beneath
their
feet
were
the
opposite
vices
superstition
ignorance
intemperance
idleness
and
falsehood
these
the
virtues
were
trampling
upon
on
the
throne
was
a
representation
of
elizabeth
at
one
place
were
eight
personages
dressed
to
represent
the
eight
beatitudes
pronounced
by
our
savior
in
his
sermon
on
the
mountthe
meek
the
merciful
c
each
of
these
qualities
was
ingeniously
ascribed
to
elizabeth
this
could
be
done
with
much
more
propriety
then
than
in
subsequent
years
in
another
place
an
ancient
figure
representing
time
came
out
of
a
cave
which
had
been
artificially
constructed
with
great
ingenuity
leading
his
daughter
whose
name
was
truth
truth
had
an
english
bible
in
her
hands
which
she
presented
to
elizabeth
as
she
passed
this
had
a
great
deal
of
meaning
for
the
catholic
government
of
mary
had
discouraged
the
circulation
of
the
scriptures
in
the
vernacular
tongue
when
the
procession
arrived
in
the
middle
of
the
city
some
officers
of
the
city
government
approached
the
queens
chariot
and
delivered
to
her
a
present
of
a
very
large
and
heavy
purse
filled
with
gold
the
queen
had
to
employ
both
hands
in
lifting
it
in
it
contained
an
amount
equal
in
value
to
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
the
queen
was
very
affable
and
gracious
to
all
the
people
on
the
way
poor
women
would
come
up
to
her
carriage
and
offer
her
flowers
which
she
would
very
condescendingly
accept
several
times
she
stopped
her
carriage
when
she
saw
that
any
one
wished
to
speak
with
her
or
had
something
to
offer
and
so
great
was
the
exaltation
of
a
queen
in
those
days
in
the
estimation
of
mankind
that
these
acts
were
considered
by
all
the
humble
citizens
of
london
as
acts
of
very
extraordinary
affability
and
they
awakened
universal
enthusiasm
there
was
one
branch
of
rosemary
given
to
the
queen
by
a
poor
woman
in
fleet
street
the
queen
put
it
up
conspicuously
in
the
carriage
where
it
remained
all
the
way
watched
by
ten
thousand
eyes
till
it
got
to
westminster
the
coronation
took
place
at
westminster
on
the
following
day
the
crown
was
placed
upon
the
young
maidens
head
in
the
midst
of
a
great
throng
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
all
superbly
dressed
and
who
made
the
vast
edifice
in
which
the
service
was
performed
ring
with
their
acclamations
and
their
shouts
of
long
live
the
queen
during
the
ceremonies
elizabeth
placed
a
wedding
ring
upon
her
finger
with
great
formality
to
denote
that
she
considered
the
occasion
as
the
celebration
of
her
espousal
to
the
realm
of
england
she
was
that
day
a
bride
and
should
never
have
she
said
any
other
husband
she
kept
this
the
only
wedding
ring
she
ever
wore
upon
her
finger
without
once
removing
it
for
more
than
forty
years

queen
elizabeth
and
mary
queen
of
scots
are
strongly
associated
together
in
the
minds
of
all
readers
of
english
history
they
were
cotemporary
sovereigns
reigning
at
the
same
time
over
sister
kingdoms
they
were
cousins
and
yet
precisely
on
account
of
the
family
relationship
which
existed
between
them
they
became
implacable
foes
the
rivalry
and
hostility
sometimes
open
and
sometimes
concealed
was
always
in
action
and
after
a
contest
of
more
than
twenty
years
elizabeth
triumphed
she
made
mary
her
prisoner
kept
her
many
years
a
captive
and
at
last
closed
the
contest
by
commanding
or
at
least
allowing
her
fallen
rival
to
be
beheaded
thus
elizabeth
had
it
all
her
own
way
while
the
scenes
of
her
life
and
of
marys
were
transpiring
but
since
that
time
mankind
have
generally
sympathized
most
strongly
with
the
conquered
one
and
condemned
the
conqueror
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
and
among
them
is
the
vast
influence
exerted
by
the
difference
in
the
personal
character
of
the
parties
mary
was
beautiful
feminine
in
spirit
and
lovely
elizabeth
was
talented
masculine
and
plain
mary
was
artless
unaffected
and
gentle
elizabeth
was
heartless
intriguing
and
insincere
with
mary
though
her
ruling
principle
was
ambition
her
ruling
passion
was
love
her
love
led
her
to
great
transgressions
and
into
many
sorrows
but
mankind
pardon
the
sins
and
pity
the
sufferings
which
are
caused
by
love
more
readily
than
those
of
any
other
origin
with
elizabeth
ambition
was
the
ruling
principle
and
the
ruling
passion
too
love
with
her
was
only
a
pastime
her
transgressions
were
the
cool
deliberate
wellconsidered
acts
of
selfishness
and
desire
of
power
during
her
lifetime
her
success
secured
her
the
applauses
of
the
world
the
world
is
always
ready
to
glorify
the
greatness
which
rises
visibly
before
it
and
to
forget
sufferings
which
are
meekly
and
patiently
borne
in
seclusion
and
solitude
men
praised
and
honored
elizabeth
therefore
while
she
lived
and
neglected
mary
but
since
the
halo
and
the
fascination
of
the
visible
greatness
and
glory
have
passed
away
they
have
found
a
far
greater
charm
in
marys
beauty
and
misfortune
than
in
her
great
rivals
pride
and
power
there
is
often
thus
a
great
difference
in
the
comparative
interest
we
take
in
persons
or
scenes
when
on
the
one
hand
they
are
realities
before
our
eyes
and
when
on
the
other
they
are
only
imaginings
which
are
brought
to
our
minds
by
pictures
or
descriptions
the
hardships
which
it
was
very
disagreeable
or
painful
to
bear
afford
often
great
amusement
or
pleasure
in
the
recollection
the
old
broken
gate
which
a
gentleman
would
not
tolerate
an
hour
upon
his
grounds
is
a
great
beauty
in
the
picture
which
hangs
in
his
parlor
we
shun
poverty
and
distress
while
they
are
actually
existing
nothing
is
more
disagreeable
to
us
and
we
gaze
upon
prosperity
and
wealth
with
neverceasing
pleasure
but
when
they
are
gone
and
we
have
only
the
tale
to
hear
it
is
the
story
of
sorrow
and
suffering
which
possesses
the
charm
thus
it
happened
that
when
the
two
queens
were
living
realities
elizabeth
was
the
center
of
attraction
and
the
object
of
universal
homage
but
when
they
came
to
be
themes
of
history
all
eyes
and
hearts
began
soon
to
turn
instinctively
to
mary
it
was
london
and
westminster
and
kenilworth
that
possessed
the
interest
while
elizabeth
lived
but
it
is
holyrood
and
loch
leven
now
it
results
from
these
causes
that
marys
story
is
read
far
more
frequently
than
elizabeths
and
this
operates
still
further
to
the
advantage
of
the
former
for
we
are
always
prone
to
take
sides
with
the
heroine
of
the
tale
we
are
reading
all
these
considerations
which
have
had
so
much
influence
on
the
judgment
men
form
or
rather
on
the
feeling
to
which
they
incline
in
this
famous
contest
have
it
must
be
confessed
very
little
to
do
with
the
true
merits
of
the
case
and
if
we
make
a
serious
attempt
to
lay
all
such
considerations
aside
and
to
look
into
the
controversy
with
cool
and
rigid
impartiality
we
shall
find
it
very
difficult
to
arrive
at
any
satisfactory
conclusion
there
are
two
questions
to
be
decided
in
advancing
their
conflicting
claims
to
the
english
crown
was
it
elizabeth
or
mary
that
was
in
the
right
if
elizabeth
was
right
were
the
measures
which
she
resorted
to
to
secure
her
own
rights
and
to
counteract
marys
pretensions
politically
justifiable
we
do
not
propose
to
add
our
own
to
the
hundred
decisions
which
various
writers
have
given
to
this
question
but
only
to
narrate
the
facts
and
leave
each
reader
to
come
to
his
own
conclusions
the
foundation
of
the
long
and
dreadful
quarrel
between
these
royal
cousins
was
as
has
been
already
remarked
their
consanguinity
which
made
them
both
competitors
for
the
same
throne
and
as
that
throne
was
in
some
respects
the
highest
and
most
powerful
in
the
world
it
is
not
surprising
that
two
such
ambitious
women
should
be
eager
and
persevering
in
their
contest
for
it
by
turning
to
the
genealogical
table
on
page
where
a
view
is
presented
of
the
royal
family
of
england
in
the
time
of
elizabeth
the
reader
will
see
once
more
what
was
the
precise
relationship
which
the
two
queens
bore
to
each
other
and
to
the
succession
by
this
table
it
is
very
evident
that
elizabeth
was
the
true
inheritor
of
the
crown
provided
it
were
admitted
that
she
was
the
lawful
daughter
and
heir
of
king
henry
the
eighth
and
this
depended
on
the
question
of
the
validity
of
her
fathers
marriage
with
his
first
wife
catharine
of
aragon
for
as
has
been
before
said
he
was
married
to
anne
boleyn
before
obtaining
any
thing
like
a
divorce
from
catharine
consequently
the
marriage
with
elizabeths
mother
could
not
be
legally
valid
unless
that
with
catharine
had
been
void
from
the
beginning
the
friends
of
mary
queen
of
scots
maintained
that
it
was
not
thus
void
and
that
consequently
the
marriage
with
anne
boleyn
was
null
that
elizabeth
therefore
the
descendant
of
the
marriage
was
not
legally
and
technically
a
daughter
of
henry
the
eighth
and
consequently
not
entitled
to
inherit
his
crown
and
that
the
crown
of
right
ought
to
descend
to
the
next
heir
that
is
to
mary
queen
of
scots
herself
queen
elizabeths
friends
and
partisans
maintained
on
the
other
hand
that
the
marriage
of
king
henry
with
catharine
was
null
and
void
from
the
beginning
because
catharine
had
been
before
the
wife
of
his
brother
the
circumstances
of
this
marriage
were
very
curious
and
peculiar
it
was
his
fathers
work
and
not
his
own
his
father
was
king
henry
the
seventh
henry
the
seventh
had
several
children
and
among
them
were
his
two
oldest
sons
arthur
and
henry
when
arthur
was
about
sixteen
years
old
his
father
being
very
much
in
want
of
money
conceived
the
plan
of
replenishing
his
coffers
by
marrying
his
son
to
a
rich
wife
he
accordingly
contracted
a
marriage
between
him
and
catharine
of
aragon
catharines
father
agreeing
to
pay
him
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
as
her
dowry
the
juvenile
bridegroom
enjoyed
the
honors
and
pleasures
of
married
life
for
a
few
months
and
then
died
this
event
was
a
great
domestic
calamity
to
the
king
not
because
he
mourned
the
loss
of
his
son
but
that
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
the
loss
of
the
dowry
by
the
law
and
usage
in
such
cases
he
was
bound
not
only
to
forego
the
payment
of
the
other
half
of
the
dowry
but
he
had
himself
no
right
to
retain
the
half
that
he
had
already
received
while
his
son
lived
being
a
minor
the
father
might
not
improperly
hold
the
money
in
his
sons
name
but
when
he
died
this
right
ceased
and
as
arthur
left
no
child
henry
perceived
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
pay
back
the
money
to
avoid
this
unpleasant
necessity
the
king
conceived
the
plan
of
marrying
the
youthful
widow
again
to
his
second
boy
henry
who
was
about
a
year
younger
than
arthur
and
he
made
proposals
to
this
effect
to
the
king
of
aragon
the
king
of
aragon
made
no
objection
to
this
proposal
except
that
it
was
a
thing
unheard
of
among
christian
nations
or
heard
of
only
to
be
condemned
for
a
man
or
even
a
boy
to
marry
his
brothers
widow
all
laws
human
and
divine
were
clear
and
absolute
against
this
still
if
the
dispensation
of
the
pope
could
be
obtained
he
would
make
no
objection
catharine
might
espouse
the
second
boy
and
he
would
allow
the
one
hundred
thousand
crowns
already
paid
to
stand
and
would
also
pay
the
other
hundred
thousand
the
dispensation
was
accordingly
obtained
and
every
thing
made
ready
for
the
marriage
very
soon
after
this
however
and
before
the
new
marriage
was
carried
into
effect
king
henry
the
seventh
died
and
this
second
boy
now
the
oldest
son
though
only
about
seventeen
years
of
age
ascended
the
throne
as
king
henry
the
eighth
there
was
great
discussion
and
debate
soon
after
his
accession
whether
the
marriage
which
his
father
had
arranged
should
proceed
some
argued
that
no
papal
dispensation
could
authorize
or
justify
such
a
marriage
others
maintained
that
a
papal
dispensation
could
legalize
any
thing
for
it
is
a
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church
that
the
pope
has
a
certain
discretionary
power
over
all
laws
human
and
divine
under
the
authority
given
to
his
great
predecessor
the
apostle
peter
by
the
words
of
christ
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heavenc
henry
seems
not
to
have
puzzled
his
head
at
all
with
the
legal
question
he
wanted
to
have
the
young
widow
for
his
wife
and
he
settled
the
affair
on
that
ground
alone
they
were
married
footnote
c
matthew
xvi
catharine
was
a
faithful
and
dutiful
spouse
but
when
at
last
henry
fell
in
love
with
anne
boleyn
he
made
these
old
difficulties
a
pretext
for
discarding
her
he
endeavored
as
has
been
already
related
to
induce
the
papal
authorities
to
annul
their
dispensation
because
they
would
not
do
it
he
espoused
the
protestant
cause
and
england
as
a
nation
seceded
from
the
catholic
communion
the
ecclesiastical
and
parliamentary
authorities
of
his
own
realm
then
being
made
protestant
annulled
the
marriage
and
thus
anne
boleyn
to
whom
he
had
previously
been
married
by
a
private
ceremony
became
legally
and
technically
his
wife
if
this
annulling
of
his
first
marriage
were
valid
then
elizabeth
was
his
heirotherwise
not
for
if
the
popes
dispensation
was
to
stand
then
catharine
was
a
wife
anne
boleyn
would
in
that
case
of
course
have
been
only
a
companion
and
elizabeth
claiming
through
her
a
usurper
the
question
thus
was
very
complicated
it
branched
into
extensive
ramifications
which
opened
a
wide
field
of
debate
and
led
to
endless
controversies
it
is
not
probable
however
that
mary
queen
of
scots
or
her
friends
gave
themselves
much
trouble
about
the
legal
points
at
issue
she
and
they
were
all
catholics
and
it
was
sufficient
for
them
to
know
that
the
holy
father
at
rome
had
sanctioned
the
marriage
of
catharine
and
that
that
marriage
if
allowed
to
stand
made
her
the
queen
of
england
she
was
at
this
time
in
france
she
had
been
sent
there
at
a
very
early
period
of
her
life
to
escape
the
troubles
of
her
native
land
and
also
to
be
educated
she
was
a
gentle
and
beautiful
child
and
as
she
grew
up
amid
the
gay
scenes
and
festivities
of
paris
she
became
a
very
great
favorite
being
universally
beloved
she
married
at
length
though
while
she
was
still
quite
young
the
son
of
the
french
king
her
young
husband
became
king
himself
soon
afterward
on
account
of
his
fathers
being
killed
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
at
a
tournament
and
thus
mary
queen
of
scots
before
became
also
queen
of
france
now
all
these
events
passed
over
thus
very
summarily
here
are
narrated
in
full
detail
in
the
history
of
mary
queen
of
scots
pertaining
to
this
series
while
mary
was
thus
residing
in
france
as
the
wife
of
the
king
she
was
surrounded
by
a
very
large
and
influential
circle
who
were
catholics
like
herself
and
who
were
also
enemies
of
elizabeth
and
of
england
and
glad
to
find
any
pretext
for
disturbing
her
reign
these
persons
brought
forward
marys
claim
they
persuaded
mary
that
she
was
fairly
entitled
to
the
english
crown
they
awakened
her
youthful
ambition
and
excited
strong
desires
in
her
heart
to
attain
to
the
high
elevation
of
queen
of
england
mary
at
length
assumed
the
title
in
some
of
her
official
acts
and
combined
the
arms
of
england
with
those
of
scotland
in
the
escutcheons
with
which
her
furniture
and
her
plate
were
emblazoned
when
queen
elizabeth
learned
that
mary
was
advancing
such
pretensions
to
her
crown
she
was
made
very
uneasy
by
it
there
was
perhaps
no
immediate
danger
but
then
there
was
a
very
large
catholic
party
in
england
and
they
would
naturally
espouse
marys
cause
and
they
might
at
some
future
time
gather
strength
so
as
to
make
elizabeth
a
great
deal
of
trouble
she
accordingly
sent
an
embassador
over
to
france
to
remonstrate
against
marys
advancing
these
pretensions
but
she
could
get
no
satisfactory
reply
mary
would
not
disavow
her
claim
to
elizabeths
crown
nor
would
she
directly
assert
it
elizabeth
then
knowing
that
all
her
danger
lay
in
the
power
and
influence
of
her
own
catholic
subjects
went
to
work
very
cautiously
and
warily
but
in
a
very
extended
and
efficient
way
to
establish
the
reformation
and
to
undermine
and
destroy
all
traces
of
catholic
power
she
proceeded
in
this
work
with
great
circumspection
so
as
not
to
excite
opposition
or
alarm
in
the
mean
time
the
protestant
cause
was
making
progress
in
scotland
too
by
its
own
inherent
energies
and
against
the
influence
of
the
government
finally
the
scotch
protestants
organized
themselves
and
commenced
an
open
rebellion
against
the
regent
whom
mary
had
left
in
power
while
she
was
away
they
sent
to
elizabeth
to
come
and
aid
them
mary
and
her
friends
in
france
sent
french
troops
to
assist
the
government
elizabeth
hesitated
very
much
whether
to
comply
with
the
request
of
the
rebels
it
is
very
dangerous
for
a
sovereign
to
countenance
rebellion
in
any
way
then
she
shrunk
too
from
the
expense
which
she
foresaw
that
such
an
attempt
would
involve
to
fit
out
a
fleet
and
to
levy
and
equip
an
army
and
to
continue
the
forces
thus
raised
in
action
during
a
long
and
uncertain
campaign
would
cost
a
large
sum
of
money
and
elizabeth
was
constitutionally
economical
and
frugal
but
then
on
the
other
hand
as
she
deliberated
upon
the
affair
long
and
anxiously
both
alone
and
with
her
council
she
thought
that
if
she
should
so
far
succeed
as
to
get
the
government
of
scotland
into
her
power
she
could
compel
mary
to
renounce
forever
all
claims
to
the
english
crown
by
threatening
her
if
she
would
not
do
it
with
the
loss
of
her
own
finally
she
decided
on
making
the
attempt
cecil
her
wise
and
prudent
counselor
strongly
advised
it
he
said
it
was
far
better
to
carry
on
the
contest
with
mary
and
the
french
in
one
of
their
countries
than
in
her
own
she
began
to
make
preparations
mary
and
the
french
government
on
learning
this
were
alarmed
in
their
turn
they
sent
word
to
elizabeth
that
for
her
to
render
countenance
and
aid
to
rebels
in
arms
against
their
sovereign
in
a
sister
kingdom
was
wholly
unjustifiable
and
they
remonstrated
most
earnestly
against
it
besides
making
this
remonstrance
they
offered
as
an
inducement
of
another
kind
that
if
she
would
refrain
from
taking
any
part
in
the
contest
in
scotland
they
would
restore
to
her
the
great
town
and
citadel
of
calais
which
her
sister
had
been
so
much
grieved
to
lose
to
this
elizabeth
replied
that
so
long
as
mary
adhered
to
her
pretensions
to
the
english
crown
she
should
be
compelled
to
take
energetic
measures
to
protect
herself
from
them
and
as
to
calais
the
possession
of
a
fishing
town
on
a
foreign
coast
was
of
no
moment
to
her
in
comparison
with
the
peace
and
security
of
her
own
realm
this
answer
did
not
tend
to
close
the
breach
besides
the
bluntness
of
the
refusal
of
their
offer
the
french
were
irritated
and
vexed
to
hear
their
famous
seaport
spoken
of
so
contemptuously
elizabeth
accordingly
fitted
out
a
fleet
and
an
army
and
sent
them
northward
a
french
fleet
with
reenforcements
for
marys
adherents
in
this
contest
set
sail
from
france
at
about
the
same
time
it
was
a
very
important
question
to
be
determined
which
of
these
two
fleets
should
get
first
upon
the
stage
of
action
illustration
the
firth
of
forth
with
leith
and
edinburgh
in
the
distance
in
the
mean
time
the
protestant
party
in
scotland
or
the
rebels
as
queen
mary
and
her
government
called
them
had
had
very
hard
work
to
maintain
their
ground
there
was
a
large
french
force
already
there
and
their
cooperation
and
aid
made
the
government
too
strong
for
the
insurgents
to
resist
but
when
elizabeths
english
army
crossed
the
frontier
the
face
of
affairs
was
changed
the
french
forces
retreated
in
their
turn
the
english
army
advanced
the
scotch
protestants
came
forth
from
the
recesses
of
the
highlands
to
which
they
had
retreated
and
drawing
closer
and
closer
around
the
french
and
the
government
forces
they
hemmed
them
in
more
and
more
narrowly
and
at
last
shut
them
up
in
the
ancient
town
of
leith
to
which
they
retreated
in
search
of
a
temporary
shelter
until
the
french
fleet
with
reenforcements
should
arrive
the
town
of
leith
is
on
the
shore
of
the
firth
of
forth
not
far
from
edinburgh
it
is
the
port
or
landingplace
of
edinburgh
in
approaching
it
from
the
sea
it
is
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
firth
and
edinburgh
stands
on
higher
land
about
two
miles
south
of
it
leith
was
strongly
fortified
in
those
days
and
the
french
army
felt
very
secure
there
though
yet
anxiously
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
fleet
which
was
to
release
them
the
english
army
advanced
in
the
mean
time
eager
to
get
possession
of
the
city
before
the
expected
succors
should
arrive
the
english
made
an
assault
upon
the
walls
the
french
with
desperate
bravery
repelled
it
the
french
made
a
sortie
that
is
they
rushed
out
of
a
sudden
and
attacked
the
english
lines
the
english
concentrated
their
forces
at
the
point
attacked
and
drove
them
back
again
these
struggles
continued
both
sides
very
eager
for
victory
and
both
watching
all
the
time
for
the
appearance
of
a
fleet
in
the
offing
at
length
one
day
a
cloud
of
white
sails
appeared
rounding
the
point
of
land
which
forms
the
southern
boundary
of
the
firth
and
the
french
were
thrown
at
once
into
the
highest
state
of
exultation
and
excitement
but
this
pleasure
was
soon
turned
into
disappointment
and
chagrin
by
finding
that
it
was
elizabeths
fleet
and
not
theirs
which
was
coming
into
view
this
ended
the
contest
the
french
fleet
never
arrived
it
was
dispersed
and
destroyed
by
a
storm
the
besieged
army
sent
out
a
flag
of
truce
proposing
to
suspend
hostilities
until
the
terms
of
a
treaty
could
be
agreed
upon
the
truce
was
granted
commissioners
were
appointed
on
each
side
these
commissioners
met
at
edinburgh
and
agreed
upon
the
terms
of
a
permanent
peace
the
treaty
which
is
called
in
history
the
treaty
of
edinburgh
was
solemnly
signed
by
the
commissioners
appointed
to
make
it
and
then
transmitted
to
england
and
to
france
to
be
ratified
by
the
respective
queens
queen
elizabeths
forces
and
the
french
forces
were
then
both
as
the
treaty
provided
immediately
withdrawn
the
dispute
too
between
the
protestants
and
the
catholics
in
scotland
was
also
settled
though
it
is
not
necessary
for
our
purpose
in
this
narrative
to
explain
particularly
in
what
way
there
was
one
point
however
in
the
stipulations
of
this
treaty
which
is
of
essential
importance
in
this
narrative
and
that
is
that
it
was
agreed
that
mary
should
relinquish
all
claims
whatever
to
the
english
crown
so
long
as
elizabeth
lived
this
in
fact
was
the
essential
point
in
the
whole
transaction
mary
it
is
true
was
not
present
to
agree
to
it
but
the
commissioners
agreed
to
it
in
her
name
and
it
was
stipulated
that
mary
should
solemnly
ratify
the
treaty
as
soon
as
it
could
be
sent
to
her
but
mary
would
not
ratify
itat
least
so
far
as
this
last
article
was
concerned
she
said
that
she
had
no
intention
of
doing
any
thing
to
molest
elizabeth
in
her
possession
of
the
throne
but
that
as
to
herself
whatever
rights
might
legally
and
justly
belong
to
her
she
could
not
consent
to
sign
them
away
the
other
articles
of
the
treaty
had
however
in
the
mean
time
brought
the
war
to
a
close
and
both
the
french
and
english
armies
were
withdrawn
neither
party
had
any
inclination
to
renew
the
conflict
but
yet
so
far
as
the
great
question
between
mary
and
elizabeth
was
concerned
the
difficulty
was
as
far
from
being
settled
as
ever
in
fact
it
was
in
a
worse
position
than
before
for
in
addition
to
her
other
grounds
of
complaint
against
mary
elizabeth
now
charged
her
with
dishonorably
refusing
to
be
bound
by
a
compact
which
had
been
solemnly
made
in
her
name
by
agents
whom
she
had
fully
authorized
to
make
it
it
was
about
this
time
that
marys
husband
the
king
of
france
died
and
after
enduring
various
trials
and
troubles
in
france
mary
concluded
to
return
to
her
own
realm
she
sent
to
elizabeth
to
get
a
safeconducta
sort
of
permission
allowing
her
to
pass
unmolested
through
the
english
seas
elizabeth
refused
to
grant
it
unless
mary
would
first
ratify
the
treaty
of
edinburgh
this
mary
would
not
do
but
undertook
rather
to
get
home
without
the
permission
elizabeth
sent
ships
to
intercept
her
but
marys
little
squadron
when
they
approached
the
shore
were
hidden
by
a
fog
and
so
she
got
safe
to
land
after
this
there
was
quiet
between
mary
and
elizabeth
for
many
years
but
no
peace

elizabeth
was
now
securely
established
upon
her
throne
it
is
true
that
mary
queen
of
scots
had
not
renounced
her
pretensions
but
there
was
no
immediate
prospect
of
her
making
any
attempt
to
realize
them
and
very
little
hope
for
her
that
she
would
be
successful
if
she
were
to
undertake
it
there
were
other
claimants
it
is
true
but
their
claims
were
more
remote
and
doubtful
than
marys
these
conflicting
pretensions
were
likely
to
make
the
country
some
trouble
after
elizabeths
death
but
there
was
very
slight
probability
that
they
would
sensibly
molest
elizabeths
possession
of
the
throne
during
her
lifetime
though
they
caused
her
no
little
anxiety
the
reign
which
elizabeth
thus
commenced
was
one
of
the
longest
most
brilliant
and
in
many
respects
the
most
prosperous
in
the
whole
series
presented
to
our
view
in
the
long
succession
of
english
sovereigns
elizabeth
continued
a
queen
for
fortyfive
years
during
all
which
time
she
remained
a
single
lady
and
she
died
at
last
a
venerable
maiden
seventy
years
of
age
it
was
not
for
want
of
lovers
or
rather
of
admirers
and
suitors
that
elizabeth
lived
single
all
her
days
during
the
first
twenty
years
of
her
reign
one
half
of
her
history
is
a
history
of
matrimonial
schemes
and
negotiations
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
marriageable
princes
and
potentates
of
europe
were
seized
one
after
another
with
a
desire
to
share
her
seat
upon
the
english
throne
they
tried
every
possible
means
to
win
her
consent
they
dispatched
embassadors
they
opened
long
negotiations
they
sent
her
shiploads
of
the
most
expensive
presents
some
of
the
nobles
of
high
rank
in
her
own
realm
expended
their
vast
estates
and
reduced
themselves
to
poverty
in
vain
attempts
to
please
her
elizabeth
like
any
other
woman
loved
these
attentions
they
pleased
her
vanity
and
gratified
those
instinctive
impulses
of
the
female
heart
by
which
woman
is
fitted
for
happiness
and
love
elizabeth
encouraged
the
hopes
of
those
who
addressed
her
sufficiently
to
keep
them
from
giving
up
in
despair
and
abandoning
her
and
in
one
or
two
cases
she
seemed
to
come
very
near
yielding
but
it
always
happened
that
when
the
time
arrived
in
which
a
final
decision
must
be
made
ambition
and
desire
of
power
proved
stronger
than
love
and
she
preferred
continuing
to
occupy
her
lofty
position
by
herself
alone
philip
of
spain
the
husband
of
her
sister
mary
was
the
first
of
these
suitors
he
had
seen
elizabeth
a
good
deal
in
england
during
his
residence
there
and
had
even
taken
her
part
in
her
difficulties
with
mary
and
had
exerted
his
influence
to
have
her
released
from
her
confinement
as
soon
as
mary
died
and
elizabeth
was
proclaimed
one
of
her
first
acts
was
as
was
very
proper
to
send
an
embassador
to
flanders
to
inform
the
bereaved
husband
of
his
loss
it
is
a
curious
illustration
of
the
degree
and
kind
of
affection
that
philip
had
borne
to
his
departed
wife
that
immediately
on
receiving
intelligence
of
her
death
by
elizabeths
embassador
he
sent
a
special
dispatch
to
his
own
embassador
in
london
to
make
a
proposal
to
elizabeth
to
take
him
for
her
husband
elizabeth
decided
very
soon
to
decline
this
proposal
she
had
ostensible
reasons
and
real
reasons
for
this
the
chief
ostensible
reason
was
that
philip
was
so
inveterately
hated
by
all
the
english
people
and
elizabeth
was
extremely
desirous
of
being
popular
she
relied
solely
on
the
loyalty
and
faithfulness
of
her
protestant
subjects
to
maintain
her
rights
to
the
succession
and
she
knew
that
if
she
displeased
them
by
such
an
unpopular
catholic
marriage
her
reliance
upon
them
must
be
very
much
weakened
they
might
even
abandon
her
entirely
the
reason
therefore
that
she
assigned
publicly
was
that
philip
was
a
catholic
and
that
the
connection
could
not
on
that
account
be
agreeable
to
the
english
people
among
the
real
reasons
was
one
of
a
very
peculiar
nature
it
happened
that
there
was
an
objection
to
her
marriage
with
philip
similar
to
the
one
urged
against
that
of
henry
with
catharine
of
aragon
catharine
had
been
the
wife
of
henrys
brother
philip
had
been
the
husband
of
elizabeths
sister
now
philip
had
offered
to
procure
the
popes
dispensation
by
which
means
this
difficulty
would
be
surmounted
but
then
all
the
world
would
say
that
if
this
dispensation
could
legalize
the
latter
marriage
the
former
must
have
been
legalized
by
it
and
this
would
destroy
the
marriage
of
anne
boleyn
and
with
it
all
elizabeths
claims
to
the
succession
she
could
not
then
marry
philip
without
by
the
very
act
effectually
undermining
all
her
own
rights
to
the
throne
she
was
far
too
subtle
and
wary
to
stumble
into
such
a
pitfall
as
that
elizabeth
rejected
this
and
some
other
offers
and
one
or
two
years
passed
away
in
the
mean
time
the
people
of
the
country
though
they
had
no
wish
to
have
her
marry
such
a
stern
and
heartless
tyrant
as
philip
of
spain
were
very
uneasy
at
the
idea
of
her
not
being
married
at
all
her
life
would
of
course
in
due
time
come
to
an
end
and
it
was
of
immense
importance
to
the
peace
and
happiness
of
the
realm
that
after
her
death
there
should
be
no
doubt
about
the
succession
if
she
were
to
be
married
and
leave
children
they
would
succeed
to
the
throne
without
question
but
if
she
were
to
die
single
and
childless
the
result
would
be
they
feared
that
the
catholics
would
espouse
the
cause
of
mary
queen
of
scots
and
the
protestants
that
of
some
protestant
descendant
of
henry
vii
and
thus
the
country
be
involved
in
all
the
horrors
of
a
protracted
civil
war
the
house
of
commons
in
those
days
was
a
very
humble
council
convened
to
discuss
and
settle
mere
internal
and
domestic
affairs
and
standing
at
a
vast
distance
from
the
splendor
and
power
of
royalty
to
which
it
looked
up
with
the
profoundest
reverence
and
awe
the
commons
at
the
close
of
one
of
their
sessions
ventured
in
a
very
timid
and
cautious
manner
to
send
a
petition
to
the
queen
urging
her
to
consent
for
the
sake
of
the
future
peace
of
the
realm
and
the
welfare
of
her
subjects
to
accept
of
a
husband
few
single
persons
are
offended
at
a
recommendation
of
marriage
if
properly
offered
from
whatever
quarter
it
may
come
the
queen
in
this
instance
returned
what
was
called
a
very
gracious
reply
she
however
very
decidedly
refused
the
request
she
said
that
as
they
had
been
very
respectful
in
the
form
of
their
petition
and
as
they
had
confined
it
to
general
terms
without
presuming
to
suggest
either
a
person
or
a
time
she
would
not
take
offense
at
their
wellintended
suggestion
but
that
she
had
no
design
of
ever
being
married
at
her
coronation
she
was
married
she
said
to
her
people
and
the
wedding
ring
was
upon
her
finger
still
her
people
were
the
objects
of
all
her
affection
and
regard
she
should
never
have
any
other
spouse
she
said
she
should
be
well
contented
to
have
it
engraved
upon
her
tombstone
here
lies
a
queen
who
lived
and
died
a
virgin
this
answer
silenced
the
commons
but
it
did
not
settle
the
question
in
the
public
mind
cases
often
occur
of
ladies
saying
very
positively
that
they
shall
never
consent
to
be
married
and
yet
afterward
altering
their
minds
and
many
ladies
knowing
how
frequently
this
takes
place
sagaciously
conclude
that
whatever
secret
resolutions
they
may
form
they
will
be
silent
about
them
lest
they
get
into
a
position
from
which
it
will
be
afterward
awkward
to
retreat
the
princes
of
the
continent
and
the
nobles
of
england
paid
no
regard
to
elizabeths
declaration
but
continued
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
obtain
her
hand
one
or
two
years
afterward
elizabeth
was
attacked
with
the
smallpox
and
for
a
time
was
dangerously
sick
in
fact
for
some
days
her
life
was
despaired
of
and
the
country
was
thrown
into
a
great
state
of
confusion
and
dismay
parties
began
to
formthe
catholics
for
mary
queen
of
scots
and
the
protestants
for
the
family
of
jane
grey
every
thing
portended
a
dreadful
contest
elizabeth
however
recovered
but
the
country
had
been
so
much
alarmed
at
their
narrow
escape
that
parliament
ventured
once
more
to
address
the
queen
on
the
subject
of
her
marriage
they
begged
that
she
would
either
consent
to
that
measure
or
if
she
was
finally
determined
not
to
do
that
that
she
would
cause
a
law
to
be
passed
or
an
edict
to
be
promulgated
deciding
beforehand
who
was
really
to
succeed
to
the
throne
in
the
event
of
her
decease
elizabeth
would
not
do
either
historians
have
speculated
a
great
deal
upon
her
motives
all
that
is
certain
is
the
fact
she
would
not
do
either
illustration
portrait
of
the
earl
of
leicester
but
though
elizabeth
thus
resisted
all
the
plans
formed
for
giving
her
a
husband
she
had
in
her
own
court
a
famous
personal
favorite
who
has
always
been
considered
as
in
some
sense
her
lover
his
name
was
originally
robert
dudley
though
she
made
him
earl
of
leicester
and
he
is
commonly
designated
in
history
by
this
latter
name
he
was
a
son
of
the
duke
of
northumberland
who
was
the
leader
of
the
plot
for
placing
lady
jane
grey
upon
the
throne
in
the
time
of
mary
he
was
a
very
elegant
and
accomplished
man
and
young
though
already
married
elizabeth
advanced
him
to
high
offices
and
honors
very
early
in
her
reign
and
kept
him
much
at
court
she
made
him
her
master
of
horse
but
she
did
not
bestow
upon
him
much
real
power
cecil
was
her
great
counselor
and
minister
of
state
he
was
a
cool
sagacious
wary
man
entirely
devoted
to
elizabeths
interests
and
to
the
glory
and
prosperity
of
the
realm
he
was
at
this
time
as
has
already
been
stated
forty
years
of
age
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
older
than
elizabeth
elizabeth
showed
great
sagacity
in
selecting
such
a
minister
and
great
wisdom
in
keeping
him
in
power
so
long
he
remained
in
her
service
all
his
life
and
died
at
last
only
a
few
years
before
elizabeth
when
he
was
nearly
eighty
years
of
age
dudley
on
the
other
hand
was
just
about
elizabeths
own
age
in
fact
it
is
said
by
some
of
the
chronicles
of
the
times
that
he
was
born
on
the
same
day
and
hour
with
her
however
this
may
be
he
became
a
great
personal
favorite
and
elizabeth
evinced
a
degree
and
kind
of
attachment
to
him
which
subjected
her
to
a
great
deal
of
censure
and
reproach
she
could
not
be
thinking
of
him
for
her
husband
it
would
seem
for
he
was
already
married
just
about
this
time
however
a
mysterious
circumstance
occurred
which
produced
a
great
deal
of
excitement
and
has
ever
since
marked
a
very
important
era
in
the
history
of
leicester
and
elizabeths
attachment
it
was
the
sudden
and
very
singular
death
of
leicesters
wife
leicester
had
among
his
other
estates
a
lonely
mansion
in
berkshire
about
fifty
miles
west
of
london
it
was
called
cumnor
house
leicesters
wife
was
sent
there
no
one
knew
why
she
went
under
the
charge
of
a
gentleman
who
was
one
of
leicesters
dependents
and
entirely
devoted
to
his
will
the
house
too
was
occupied
by
a
man
who
had
the
character
of
being
ready
for
any
deed
which
might
be
required
of
him
by
his
master
the
name
of
leicesters
wife
was
amy
robesart
in
a
short
time
news
came
to
london
that
the
unhappy
woman
was
killed
by
a
fall
down
stairs
the
instantaneous
suspicion
darted
at
once
into
every
ones
mind
that
she
had
been
murdered
rumors
circulated
all
around
the
place
where
the
death
had
occurred
that
she
had
been
murdered
a
conscientious
clergyman
of
the
neighborhood
sent
an
account
of
the
case
to
london
to
the
queens
ministers
stating
the
facts
and
urging
the
queen
to
order
an
investigation
of
the
affair
but
nothing
was
ever
done
it
has
accordingly
been
the
general
belief
of
mankind
since
that
time
that
the
unprincipled
courtier
destroyed
his
wife
in
the
vain
hope
of
becoming
afterward
the
husband
of
the
queen
the
people
of
england
were
greatly
incensed
at
this
transaction
they
had
hated
leicester
before
and
they
hated
him
now
more
inveterately
still
favorites
are
very
generally
hated
royal
favorites
always
he
however
grew
more
and
more
intimate
with
the
queen
and
every
body
feared
that
he
was
going
to
be
her
husband
their
conduct
was
watched
very
closely
by
all
the
great
world
and
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
a
thousand
circumstances
and
occurrences
were
reported
busily
from
tongue
to
tongue
which
the
actors
in
them
doubtless
supposed
passed
unobserved
or
were
forgotten
one
night
for
instance
queen
elizabeth
having
supped
with
dudley
was
going
home
in
her
chair
lighted
by
torchbearers
at
the
present
day
all
london
is
lighted
brilliantly
at
midnight
with
gas
and
ladies
go
home
from
their
convivial
and
pleasure
assemblies
in
luxurious
carriages
in
which
they
are
rocked
gently
along
through
broad
and
magnificent
avenues
as
bright
almost
as
day
then
however
it
was
very
different
the
lady
was
borne
slowly
along
through
narrow
and
dingy
and
dangerous
streets
with
a
train
of
torches
before
and
behind
her
dispelling
the
darkness
a
moment
with
their
glare
and
then
leaving
it
more
deep
and
somber
than
ever
on
the
night
of
which
we
are
speaking
elizabeth
feeling
in
good
humor
began
to
talk
with
some
of
the
torchbearers
on
the
way
they
were
dudleys
men
and
elizabeth
began
to
praise
their
master
she
said
to
one
of
them
among
other
things
that
she
was
going
to
raise
him
to
a
higher
position
than
any
of
his
name
had
ever
borne
before
now
as
dudleys
father
was
a
duke
which
title
denotes
the
highest
rank
of
the
english
nobility
the
man
inferred
that
the
queens
meaning
was
that
she
intended
to
marry
him
and
thus
make
him
a
sort
of
king
the
man
told
the
story
boastingly
to
one
of
the
servants
of
lord
arundel
who
was
also
a
suitor
of
the
queens
the
servants
each
taking
the
part
of
his
master
in
the
rivalry
quarreled
lord
arundels
man
said
that
he
wished
that
dudley
had
been
hung
with
his
father
or
else
that
somebody
would
shoot
him
in
the
street
with
a
dag
a
dag
was
in
the
language
of
those
days
the
name
for
a
pistol
time
moved
on
and
though
leicester
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
a
favorite
the
plan
of
his
being
married
to
elizabeth
if
any
such
were
entertained
by
either
party
appeared
to
come
no
nearer
to
an
accomplishment
elizabeth
lived
in
great
state
and
splendor
sometimes
residing
in
her
palaces
in
or
near
london
and
sometimes
making
royal
progresses
about
her
dominions
dudley
together
with
the
other
prominent
members
of
her
court
accompanied
her
on
these
excursions
and
obviously
enjoyed
a
very
high
degree
of
personal
favor
she
encouraged
at
the
same
time
her
other
suitors
so
that
on
all
the
great
public
occasions
of
state
at
the
tilts
and
tournaments
at
the
playswhich
bytheway
in
those
days
were
performed
in
the
churcheson
all
the
royal
progresses
and
grand
receptions
at
cities
castles
and
universities
the
lady
queen
was
surrounded
always
by
royal
or
noble
beaux
who
made
her
presents
and
paid
her
a
thousand
compliments
and
offered
her
gallant
attentions
without
numberall
prompted
by
ambition
in
the
guise
of
love
they
smiled
upon
the
queen
with
a
perpetual
sycophancy
and
gnashed
their
teeth
secretly
upon
each
other
with
a
hatred
which
unlike
the
pretended
love
was
at
least
honest
and
sincere
leicester
was
the
gayest
most
accomplished
and
most
favored
of
them
all
and
the
rest
accordingly
combined
and
agreed
in
hating
him
more
than
they
did
each
other
queen
elizabeth
however
never
really
admitted
that
she
had
any
design
of
making
leicester
or
dudley
as
he
is
indiscriminately
called
her
husband
in
fact
at
one
time
she
recommended
him
to
mary
queen
of
scots
for
a
husband
after
mary
returned
to
scotland
the
two
queens
were
for
a
time
on
good
terms
as
professed
friends
though
they
were
in
fact
all
the
time
most
inveterate
and
implacable
foes
but
each
knowing
how
much
injury
the
other
might
do
her
wished
to
avoid
exciting
any
unnecessary
hostility
mary
particularly
as
she
found
she
could
not
get
possession
of
the
english
throne
during
elizabeths
lifetime
concluded
to
try
to
conciliate
her
in
hopes
to
persuade
her
to
acknowledge
by
act
of
parliament
her
right
to
the
succession
after
her
death
so
she
used
to
confer
with
elizabeth
on
the
subject
of
her
own
marriage
and
to
ask
her
advice
about
it
elizabeth
did
not
wish
to
have
mary
married
at
all
and
so
she
always
proposed
somebody
who
she
knew
would
be
out
of
the
question
she
at
one
time
proposed
leicester
and
for
a
time
seemed
quite
in
earnest
about
it
especially
so
long
as
mary
seemed
averse
to
it
at
length
however
when
mary
in
order
to
test
her
sincerity
seemed
inclined
to
yield
elizabeth
retreated
in
her
turn
and
withdrew
her
proposals
mary
then
gave
up
the
hope
of
satisfying
elizabeth
in
any
way
and
married
lord
darnley
without
her
consent
elizabeths
regard
for
dudley
however
still
continued
she
made
him
earl
of
leicester
and
granted
him
the
magnificent
castle
of
kenilworth
with
a
large
estate
adjoining
and
surrounding
it
the
rents
of
the
lands
giving
him
a
princely
income
and
enabling
him
to
live
in
almost
royal
state
queen
elizabeth
visited
him
frequently
in
this
castle
one
of
these
visits
is
very
minutely
described
by
the
chroniclers
of
the
times
the
earl
made
the
most
expensive
and
extraordinary
preparations
for
the
reception
and
entertainment
of
the
queen
and
her
retinue
on
this
occasion
the
moatwhich
is
a
broad
canal
filled
with
water
surrounding
the
castlehad
a
floating
island
upon
it
with
a
fictitious
personage
whom
they
called
the
lady
of
the
lake
upon
the
island
who
sung
a
song
in
praise
of
elizabeth
as
she
passed
the
bridge
there
was
also
an
artificial
dolphin
swimming
upon
the
water
with
a
band
of
musicians
within
it
as
the
queen
advanced
across
the
park
men
and
women
in
strange
disguises
came
out
to
meet
her
and
to
offer
her
salutations
and
praises
one
was
dressed
as
a
sibyl
another
like
an
american
savage
and
a
third
who
was
concealed
represented
an
echo
this
visit
was
continued
for
nineteen
days
and
the
stories
of
the
splendid
entertainments
provided
for
the
companythe
plays
the
bearbaitings
the
fireworks
the
huntings
the
mock
fights
the
feastings
and
revelriesfilled
all
europe
at
the
time
and
have
been
celebrated
by
historians
and
storytellers
ever
since
the
castle
of
kenilworth
is
now
a
very
magnificent
heap
of
ruins
and
is
explored
every
year
by
thousands
of
visitors
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
leicester
if
he
ever
really
entertained
any
serious
designs
of
being
elizabeths
husband
at
last
gave
up
his
hopes
and
married
another
woman
this
lady
had
been
the
wife
of
the
earl
of
essex
her
husband
died
very
suddenly
and
mysteriously
just
before
leicester
married
her
leicester
kept
the
marriage
secret
for
some
time
and
when
it
came
at
last
to
the
queens
knowledge
she
was
exceedingly
angry
she
had
him
arrested
and
sent
to
prison
however
she
gradually
recovered
from
her
fit
of
resentment
and
by
degrees
restored
him
to
her
favor
again
twenty
years
of
elizabeths
reign
thus
passed
away
and
no
one
of
all
her
suitors
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
her
hand
all
this
time
her
government
had
been
administered
with
much
efficiency
and
power
all
europe
had
been
in
great
commotion
during
almost
the
whole
period
on
account
of
the
terrible
conflicts
which
were
raging
between
the
catholics
and
the
protestants
each
party
having
been
doing
its
utmost
to
exterminate
and
destroy
the
other
elizabeth
and
her
government
took
part
very
frequently
in
these
contests
sometimes
by
negotiations
and
sometimes
by
fleets
and
armies
but
always
sagaciously
and
cautiously
and
generally
with
great
effect
in
the
mean
time
however
the
queen
being
now
fortyfive
years
of
age
was
rapidly
approaching
the
time
when
questions
of
marriage
could
no
longer
be
entertained
her
lovers
or
rather
her
suitors
had
one
after
another
given
up
the
pursuit
and
disappeared
from
the
field
one
only
seemed
at
length
to
remain
on
the
decision
of
whose
fate
the
final
result
of
the
great
question
of
the
queens
marriage
seemed
to
be
pending
it
was
the
duke
of
anjou
he
was
a
french
prince
his
brother
who
had
been
the
duke
of
anjou
before
him
was
now
king
henry
iii
of
france
his
own
name
was
francis
he
was
twenty
five
years
younger
than
elizabeth
and
he
was
only
seventeen
years
of
age
when
it
was
first
proposed
that
he
should
marry
her
he
was
then
duke
of
alencon
it
was
his
mothers
plan
she
was
the
great
catharine
de
medici
queen
of
france
and
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
women
for
her
talents
her
management
and
her
power
that
ever
lived
having
one
son
upon
the
throne
of
france
she
wanted
the
throne
of
england
for
the
other
the
negotiation
had
been
pending
fruitlessly
for
many
years
and
now
in
it
was
vigorously
renewed
the
duke
himself
who
was
at
this
time
a
young
man
of
twentyfour
or
five
began
to
be
impatient
and
earnest
in
his
suit
there
was
in
fact
one
good
reason
why
he
should
be
so
elizabeth
was
fortyeight
and
unless
the
match
were
soon
concluded
the
time
for
effecting
it
would
be
obviously
forever
gone
by
illustration
the
barges
on
the
river
he
had
never
had
an
interview
with
the
queen
he
had
seen
pictures
of
her
however
and
he
sent
an
embassador
over
to
england
to
urge
his
suit
and
to
convince
elizabeth
how
much
he
was
in
love
with
her
charms
the
name
of
this
agent
was
simier
he
was
a
very
polite
and
accomplished
man
and
soon
learned
the
art
of
winning
his
way
to
elizabeths
favor
leicester
was
very
jealous
of
his
success
the
two
favorites
soon
imbibed
a
terrible
enmity
for
each
other
they
filled
the
court
with
their
quarrels
the
progress
of
the
negotiation
however
went
on
the
people
taking
sides
very
violently
some
for
and
some
against
the
projected
marriage
the
animosities
became
exceedingly
virulent
until
at
length
simiers
life
seemed
to
be
in
danger
he
said
that
leicester
had
hired
one
of
the
guards
to
assassinate
him
and
it
is
a
fact
that
one
day
as
he
and
the
queen
with
other
attendants
were
making
an
excursion
upon
the
river
a
shot
was
fired
from
the
shore
into
the
barge
the
shot
did
no
injury
except
to
wound
one
of
the
oarsmen
and
frighten
all
the
party
pretty
thoroughly
some
thought
the
shot
was
aimed
at
simier
and
others
at
the
queen
herself
it
was
afterward
proved
or
supposed
to
be
proved
that
this
shot
was
the
accidental
discharge
of
a
gun
without
any
evil
intention
whatever
in
the
mean
time
elizabeth
grew
more
and
more
interested
in
the
idea
of
having
the
young
duke
for
her
husband
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
maidenly
resolutions
which
had
stood
their
ground
so
firmly
for
twenty
years
were
to
be
conquered
at
last
the
more
however
she
seemed
to
approach
toward
a
consent
to
the
measure
the
more
did
all
the
officers
of
her
government
and
the
nation
at
large
oppose
it
there
were
in
their
minds
two
insuperable
objections
to
the
match
the
candidate
was
a
frenchman
and
he
was
a
papist
the
council
interceded
friends
remonstrated
the
nation
murmured
and
threatened
a
book
was
published
entitled
the
discovery
of
a
gaping
gulf
wherein
england
is
like
to
be
swallowed
up
by
another
french
marriage
unless
the
lord
forbid
the
bans
by
letting
her
see
the
sin
and
punishment
thereof
the
author
of
it
had
his
right
hand
cut
off
for
his
punishment
at
length
after
a
series
of
most
extraordinary
discussions
negotiations
and
occurrences
which
kept
the
whole
country
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
for
a
long
time
the
affair
was
at
last
all
settled
the
marriage
articles
both
political
and
personal
were
all
arranged
the
nuptials
were
to
be
celebrated
in
six
weeks
the
duke
came
over
in
great
state
and
was
received
with
all
possible
pomp
and
parade
festivals
and
banquets
were
arranged
without
number
and
in
the
most
magnificent
style
to
do
him
and
his
attendants
honor
at
one
of
them
the
queen
took
off
a
ring
from
her
finger
and
put
it
upon
his
in
the
presence
of
a
great
assembly
which
was
the
first
announcement
to
the
public
that
the
affair
was
finally
settled
the
news
spread
every
where
with
great
rapidity
it
produced
in
england
great
consternation
and
distress
but
on
the
continent
it
was
welcomed
with
joy
and
the
great
english
alliance
now
so
obviously
approaching
was
celebrated
with
ringing
of
bells
bonfires
and
grand
illuminations
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
as
soon
as
the
obstacles
were
all
removed
and
there
was
no
longer
opposition
to
stimulate
the
determination
of
the
queen
her
heart
failed
her
at
last
and
she
finally
concluded
that
she
would
not
be
married
after
all
she
sent
for
the
duke
one
morning
to
come
and
see
her
what
takes
place
precisely
between
ladies
and
gentlemen
when
they
break
off
their
engagements
is
not
generally
very
publicly
known
but
the
duke
came
out
from
this
interview
in
a
fit
of
great
vexation
and
anger
he
pulled
off
the
queens
ring
and
threw
it
from
him
muttering
curses
upon
the
fickleness
and
faithlessness
of
women
still
elizabeth
would
not
admit
that
the
match
was
broken
off
she
continued
to
treat
the
duke
with
civility
and
to
pay
him
many
honors
he
decided
however
to
return
to
the
continent
she
accompanied
him
a
part
of
the
way
to
the
coast
and
took
leave
of
him
with
many
professions
of
sorrow
at
the
parting
and
begged
him
to
come
back
soon
this
he
promised
to
do
but
he
never
returned
he
lived
some
time
afterward
in
comparative
neglect
and
obscurity
and
mankind
considered
the
question
of
the
marriage
of
elizabeth
as
now
at
last
settled
forever

mankind
have
always
been
very
much
divided
in
opinion
in
respect
to
the
personal
character
of
queen
elizabeth
but
in
one
point
all
have
agreed
and
that
is
that
in
the
management
of
public
affairs
she
was
a
woman
of
extraordinary
talent
and
sagacity
combining
in
a
very
remarkable
degree
a
certain
cautious
good
sense
and
prudence
with
the
most
determined
resolution
and
energy
she
reigned
about
forty
years
and
during
almost
all
that
time
the
whole
western
part
of
the
continent
of
europe
was
convulsed
with
the
most
terrible
conflicts
between
the
protestant
and
catholic
parties
the
predominance
of
power
was
with
the
catholics
and
was
of
course
hostile
to
elizabeth
she
had
moreover
in
the
field
a
very
prominent
competitor
for
her
throne
in
mary
queen
of
scots
the
foreign
protestant
powers
were
ready
to
aid
this
claimant
and
there
was
besides
in
her
own
dominions
a
very
powerful
interest
in
her
favor
the
great
divisions
of
sentiment
in
england
and
the
energy
with
which
each
party
struggled
against
its
opponents
produced
at
all
times
a
prodigious
pressure
of
opposing
forces
which
bore
heavily
upon
the
safety
of
the
state
and
of
elizabeths
government
and
threatened
them
with
continual
danger
the
administration
of
public
affairs
moved
on
during
all
this
time
trembling
continually
under
the
heavy
shocks
it
was
constantly
receiving
like
a
ship
staggering
on
in
a
storm
its
safety
depending
on
the
nice
equilibrium
between
the
shocks
of
the
seas
the
pressure
of
the
wind
upon
the
sails
and
the
weight
and
steadiness
of
the
ballast
below
during
all
this
forty
years
it
is
admitted
that
elizabeth
and
her
wise
and
sagacious
ministers
managed
very
admirably
they
maintained
the
position
and
honor
of
england
as
a
protestant
power
with
great
success
and
the
country
during
the
whole
period
made
great
progress
in
the
arts
in
commerce
and
in
improvements
of
every
kind
elizabeths
greatest
danger
and
her
greatest
source
of
solicitude
during
her
whole
reign
was
from
the
claims
of
mary
queen
of
scots
we
have
already
described
the
energetic
measures
which
she
took
at
the
commencement
of
her
reign
to
counter
act
and
head
off
at
the
outset
these
dangerous
pretensions
though
these
efforts
were
triumphantly
successful
at
the
time
still
the
victory
was
not
final
it
postponed
but
did
not
destroy
the
danger
mary
continued
to
claim
the
english
throne
innumerable
plots
were
beginning
to
be
formed
among
the
catholics
in
elizabeths
own
dominions
for
making
her
queen
foreign
potentates
and
powers
were
watching
an
opportunity
to
assist
in
these
plans
at
last
mary
on
account
of
internal
difficulties
in
her
own
land
fled
across
the
frontier
into
england
to
save
her
life
and
elizabeth
made
her
prisoner
in
england
to
plan
or
design
the
dethronement
of
a
monarch
is
in
a
subject
high
treason
mary
had
undoubtedly
designed
the
dethronement
of
elizabeth
and
was
waiting
only
an
opportunity
to
accomplish
it
elizabeth
consequently
condemned
her
as
guilty
of
treason
in
effect
and
marys
sole
defense
against
this
charge
was
that
she
was
not
a
subject
elizabeth
yielded
to
this
plea
when
she
first
found
mary
in
her
power
so
far
as
not
to
take
her
life
but
she
consigned
her
to
a
long
and
weary
captivity
this
however
only
made
the
matter
worse
it
stimulated
the
enthusiasm
and
zeal
of
all
the
catholics
in
england
to
have
their
leader
and
as
they
believed
their
rightful
queen
a
captive
in
the
midst
of
them
and
they
formed
continually
the
most
extensive
and
most
dangerous
plots
these
plots
were
discovered
and
suppressed
one
after
another
each
one
producing
more
anxiety
and
alarm
than
the
preceding
for
a
time
mary
suffered
no
evil
consequences
from
these
discoveries
further
than
an
increase
of
the
rigors
of
her
confinement
at
last
the
patience
of
the
queen
and
of
her
government
was
exhausted
a
law
was
passed
against
treason
expressed
in
such
terms
as
to
include
mary
in
the
liability
for
its
dreadful
penalties
although
she
was
not
a
subject
in
case
of
any
new
transgression
and
when
the
next
case
occurred
they
brought
her
to
trial
and
condemned
her
to
death
the
sentence
was
executed
in
the
gloomy
castle
of
fotheringay
where
she
was
then
confined
as
to
the
question
whether
mary
or
elizabeth
had
the
rightful
title
to
the
english
crown
it
has
not
only
never
been
settled
but
from
its
very
nature
it
can
not
be
settled
it
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
a
peculiar
contingency
occurs
which
runs
beyond
the
scope
and
reach
of
all
the
ordinary
principles
by
which
analogous
cases
are
tried
and
leads
to
questions
which
can
not
be
decided
as
long
as
a
hereditary
succession
goes
smoothly
on
like
a
river
keeping
within
its
banks
we
can
decide
subordinate
and
incidental
questions
which
may
arise
but
when
a
case
occurs
in
which
we
have
the
omnipotence
of
parliament
to
set
off
against
the
infallibility
of
the
popethe
sacred
obligations
of
a
will
against
the
equally
sacred
principles
of
hereditary
successionand
when
we
have
at
last
two
contradictory
actions
of
the
same
ultimate
umpire
we
find
all
technical
grounds
of
coming
to
a
conclusion
gone
we
then
abandoning
these
seek
for
some
higher
and
more
universal
principlesessential
in
the
nature
of
things
and
thus
independent
of
the
will
and
action
of
manto
see
if
they
will
throw
any
light
on
the
subject
but
we
soon
find
ourselves
as
much
perplexed
and
confounded
in
this
inquiry
as
we
were
before
we
ask
in
beginning
the
investigation
what
is
the
ground
and
nature
of
the
right
by
which
any
king
or
queen
succeeds
to
the
power
possessed
by
his
ancestors
and
we
give
up
in
despair
not
being
able
to
answer
even
this
first
preliminary
inquiry
mankind
have
not
in
their
estimate
of
elizabeths
character
condemned
so
decidedly
the
substantial
acts
which
she
performed
as
the
duplicity
the
falseheartedness
and
the
false
pretensions
which
she
manifested
in
performing
them
had
she
said
frankly
and
openly
to
mary
before
the
world
if
these
schemes
for
revolutionizing
england
and
placing
yourself
upon
the
throne
continue
your
life
must
be
forfeited
my
own
safety
and
the
safety
of
the
realm
absolutely
demand
it
and
then
had
fairly
and
openly
and
honestly
executed
her
threat
mankind
would
have
been
silent
on
the
subject
if
they
had
not
been
satisfied
but
if
she
had
really
acted
thus
she
would
not
have
been
elizabeth
she
in
fact
pursued
a
very
different
course
she
maneuvered
schemed
and
planned
she
pretended
to
be
full
of
the
warmest
affection
for
her
cousin
she
contrived
plot
after
plot
and
scheme
after
scheme
to
ensnare
her
and
when
at
last
the
execution
took
place
in
obedience
to
her
own
formal
and
written
authority
she
pretended
to
great
astonishment
and
rage
she
never
meant
that
the
sentence
should
take
effect
she
filled
england
france
and
scotland
with
the
loud
expressions
of
her
regret
and
she
punished
the
agents
who
had
executed
her
will
this
management
was
to
prevent
the
friends
of
mary
from
forming
plans
of
revenge
this
was
her
character
in
all
things
she
was
famous
for
her
false
pretensions
and
double
dealings
and
yet
with
all
her
talents
and
sagacity
the
disguise
she
assumed
was
sometimes
so
thin
and
transparent
that
her
assuming
it
was
simply
ridiculous
maiden
ladies
who
spend
their
lives
in
some
respects
alone
often
become
deeply
imbued
with
a
kind
and
benevolent
spirit
which
seeks
its
gratification
in
relieving
the
pains
and
promoting
the
happiness
of
all
around
them
conscious
that
the
circumstances
which
have
caused
them
to
lead
a
single
life
would
secure
for
them
the
sincere
sympathy
and
the
increased
esteem
of
all
who
know
them
if
delicacy
and
propriety
allowed
them
to
be
expressed
they
feel
a
strong
degree
of
selfrespect
they
live
happily
and
are
a
continual
means
of
comfort
and
joy
to
all
around
them
this
was
not
so
however
with
elizabeth
she
was
jealous
petulant
irritable
she
envied
others
the
love
and
the
domestic
enjoyments
which
ambition
forbade
her
to
share
and
she
seemed
to
take
great
pleasure
in
thwarting
and
interfering
with
the
plans
of
others
for
securing
this
happiness
one
remarkable
instance
of
this
kind
occurred
it
seems
she
was
sometimes
accustomed
to
ask
the
young
ladies
of
the
courther
maids
of
honorif
they
ever
thought
about
being
married
and
they
being
cunning
enough
to
know
what
sort
of
an
answer
would
please
the
queen
always
promptly
denied
that
they
did
so
oh
no
they
never
thought
about
being
married
at
all
there
was
one
young
lady
however
artless
and
sincere
who
when
questioned
in
this
way
answered
in
her
simplicity
that
she
often
thought
of
it
and
that
she
should
like
to
be
married
very
much
if
her
father
would
only
consent
to
her
union
with
a
certain
gentleman
whom
she
loved
ah
said
elizabeth
well
i
will
speak
to
your
father
about
it
and
see
what
i
can
do
not
long
after
this
the
father
of
the
young
lady
came
to
court
and
the
queen
proposed
the
subject
to
him
the
father
said
that
he
had
not
been
aware
that
his
daughter
had
formed
such
an
attachment
but
that
he
should
certainly
give
his
consent
without
any
hesitation
to
any
arrangement
of
that
kind
which
the
queen
desired
and
advised
that
is
all
then
said
the
queen
i
will
do
the
rest
so
she
called
the
young
lady
into
her
presence
and
told
her
that
her
father
had
given
his
free
consent
the
maidens
heart
bounded
with
joy
and
she
began
to
express
her
happiness
and
her
gratitude
to
the
queen
promising
to
do
every
thing
in
her
power
to
please
her
when
elizabeth
interrupted
her
saying
yes
you
will
act
so
as
to
please
me
i
have
no
doubt
but
you
are
not
going
to
be
a
fool
and
get
married
your
father
has
given
his
consent
to
me
and
not
to
you
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
you
will
never
get
it
out
of
my
possession
you
were
pretty
bold
to
acknowledge
your
foolishness
to
me
so
readily
elizabeth
was
very
irritable
and
could
never
bear
any
contradiction
in
the
case
even
of
leicester
who
had
such
an
unbounded
influence
over
her
if
he
presumed
a
little
too
much
he
would
meet
sometimes
a
very
severe
rebuff
such
as
nobody
but
a
courtier
would
endure
but
courtiers
haughty
and
arrogant
as
they
are
in
their
bearing
toward
inferiors
are
generally
fawning
sycophants
toward
those
above
them
and
they
will
submit
to
any
thing
imaginable
from
a
queen
it
was
the
custom
in
elizabeths
days
as
it
is
now
among
the
great
in
european
countries
to
have
a
series
or
suite
of
rooms
one
beyond
the
other
the
inner
one
being
the
presence
chamber
and
the
others
being
occupied
by
attendants
and
servants
of
various
grades
to
regulate
and
control
the
admission
of
company
some
of
these
officers
were
styled
gentlemen
of
the
black
rod
that
name
being
derived
from
a
peculiar
badge
of
authority
which
they
were
accustomed
to
carry
it
happened
one
day
that
a
certain
gay
captain
a
follower
of
leicesters
and
a
sort
of
favorite
of
his
was
stopped
in
the
antechamber
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
black
rod
named
bowyer
the
queen
having
ordered
him
to
be
more
careful
and
particular
in
respect
to
the
admission
of
company
the
captain
who
was
proud
of
the
favor
which
he
enjoyed
with
leicester
resented
this
affront
and
threatened
the
officer
and
he
was
engaged
in
an
altercation
with
him
on
the
subject
when
leicester
came
in
leicester
took
his
favorites
part
and
told
the
gentleman
usher
that
he
was
a
knave
and
that
he
would
have
him
turned
out
of
office
leicester
was
accustomed
to
feel
so
much
confidence
in
his
power
over
elizabeth
that
his
manner
toward
all
beneath
him
had
become
exceedingly
haughty
and
overbearing
he
supposed
probably
that
the
officer
would
humble
himself
at
once
before
his
rebukes
the
officer
however
instead
of
this
stepped
directly
in
before
leicester
who
was
then
going
in
himself
to
the
presence
of
the
queen
kneeled
before
her
majesty
related
the
facts
of
the
case
and
humbly
asked
what
it
was
her
pleasure
that
he
should
do
he
had
obeyed
her
majestys
orders
he
said
and
had
been
called
imperiously
to
account
for
it
and
threatened
violently
by
leicester
and
he
wished
now
to
know
whether
leicester
was
king
or
her
majesty
queen
elizabeth
was
very
much
displeased
with
the
conduct
of
her
favorite
she
turned
to
him
and
beginning
with
a
sort
of
oath
which
she
was
accustomed
to
use
when
irritated
and
angry
she
addressed
him
in
invectives
and
reproaches
the
most
severe
she
gave
him
in
a
word
what
would
be
called
a
scolding
were
it
not
that
scolding
is
a
term
not
sufficiently
dignified
for
history
even
for
such
humble
history
as
this
she
told
him
that
she
had
indeed
shown
him
favor
but
her
favor
was
not
so
fixed
and
settled
upon
him
that
nobody
else
was
to
have
any
share
and
that
if
he
imagined
that
he
could
lord
it
over
her
household
she
would
contrive
a
way
very
soon
to
convince
him
of
his
mistake
there
was
one
mistress
to
rule
there
she
said
but
no
master
she
then
dismissed
bowyer
telling
leicester
that
if
any
evil
happened
to
him
she
should
hold
him
that
is
leicester
to
a
strict
account
for
it
as
she
should
be
convinced
it
would
have
come
through
his
means
leicester
was
exceedingly
chagrined
at
this
result
of
the
difficulty
of
course
he
dared
not
defend
himself
or
reply
all
the
other
courtiers
enjoyed
his
confusion
very
highly
and
one
of
them
in
giving
an
account
of
the
affair
said
in
conclusion
that
the
queens
words
so
quelled
him
that
for
some
time
after
his
feigned
humility
was
one
of
his
best
virtues
queen
elizabeth
very
evidently
possessed
that
peculiar
combination
of
quickness
of
intellect
and
readiness
of
tongue
which
enables
those
who
possess
it
to
say
very
sharp
and
biting
things
when
vexed
or
out
of
humor
it
is
a
brilliant
talent
though
it
always
makes
those
who
possess
it
hated
and
feared
elizabeth
was
often
wantonly
cruel
in
the
exercise
of
this
satirical
power
considering
very
littleas
is
usually
the
case
with
such
personsthe
justice
of
her
invectives
but
obeying
blindly
the
impulses
of
the
ill
nature
which
prompted
her
to
utter
them
we
have
already
said
that
she
seemed
always
to
have
a
special
feeling
of
ill
will
against
marriage
and
every
thing
that
pertained
to
it
and
she
had
particularly
a
theory
that
the
bishops
and
the
clergy
ought
not
to
be
married
she
could
not
absolutely
prohibit
their
marrying
but
she
did
issue
an
injunction
forbidding
any
of
the
heads
of
the
colleges
or
cathedrals
to
take
their
wives
into
the
same
or
any
of
their
precincts
at
one
time
in
one
of
her
royal
progresses
through
the
country
she
was
received
and
very
magnificently
and
hospitably
entertained
by
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
at
his
palace
the
archbishops
wife
exerted
herself
very
particularly
to
please
the
queen
and
to
do
her
honor
elizabeth
evinced
her
gratitude
by
turning
to
her
as
she
was
about
to
take
her
leave
and
saying
that
she
could
not
call
her
the
archbishops
wife
and
did
not
like
to
call
her
his
mistress
and
so
she
did
not
know
what
to
call
her
but
that
at
all
events
she
was
very
much
obliged
to
her
for
her
hospitality
elizabeths
highest
officers
of
state
were
continually
exposed
to
her
sharp
and
sudden
reproaches
and
they
often
incurred
them
by
sincere
and
honest
efforts
to
gratify
and
serve
her
she
had
made
an
arrangement
one
day
to
go
into
the
city
of
london
to
st
pauls
church
to
hear
the
dean
of
christ
church
a
distinguished
clergyman
preach
the
dean
procured
a
copy
of
the
prayer
book
and
had
it
splendidly
bound
with
a
great
number
of
beautiful
and
costly
prints
interleaved
in
it
these
prints
were
all
of
a
religious
character
being
representations
of
sacred
history
or
of
scenes
in
the
lives
of
the
saints
the
volume
thus
prepared
was
very
beautiful
and
it
was
placed
when
the
sabbath
morning
arrived
upon
the
queens
cushion
at
the
church
ready
for
her
use
the
queen
entered
in
great
state
and
took
her
seat
in
the
midst
of
all
the
parade
and
ceremony
customary
on
such
occasions
as
soon
however
as
she
opened
the
book
and
saw
the
pictures
she
frowned
and
seemed
to
be
much
displeased
she
shut
the
book
and
put
it
away
and
called
for
her
own
and
after
the
service
she
sent
for
the
dean
and
asked
him
who
brought
that
book
there
he
replied
in
a
very
humble
and
submissive
manner
that
he
had
procured
it
himself
having
intended
it
as
a
present
for
her
majesty
this
only
produced
fresh
expressions
of
displeasure
she
proceeded
to
rebuke
him
severely
for
countenancing
such
a
popish
practice
as
the
introduction
of
pictures
in
the
churches
all
this
time
elizabeth
had
herself
a
crucifix
in
her
own
private
chapel
and
the
dean
himself
on
the
other
hand
was
a
firm
and
consistent
protestant
entirely
opposed
to
the
catholic
system
of
images
and
pictures
as
elizabeth
very
well
knew
this
sort
of
roughness
was
a
somewhat
masculine
trait
of
character
for
a
lady
it
must
be
acknowledged
and
not
a
very
agreeable
one
even
in
man
but
with
some
of
the
bad
qualities
of
the
other
sex
elizabeth
possessed
also
some
that
were
good
she
was
courageous
and
she
evinced
her
courage
sometimes
in
a
very
noble
manner
at
one
time
when
political
excitement
ran
very
high
her
friends
thought
that
there
was
serious
danger
in
her
appearing
openly
in
public
and
they
urged
her
not
to
do
it
but
to
confine
herself
within
her
palaces
for
a
time
until
the
excitement
should
pass
away
but
no
the
representations
made
to
her
produced
no
effect
she
said
she
would
continue
to
go
out
just
as
freely
as
ever
she
did
not
think
that
there
was
really
any
danger
and
besides
if
there
was
she
did
not
care
she
would
rather
take
her
chance
of
being
killed
than
to
be
kept
shut
up
like
a
prisoner
at
the
time
too
when
the
shot
was
fired
at
the
barge
in
which
she
was
going
down
the
thames
many
of
her
ministers
thought
it
was
aimed
at
her
they
endeavored
to
convince
her
of
this
and
urged
her
not
to
expose
herself
to
such
dangers
she
replied
that
she
did
not
believe
that
the
shot
was
aimed
at
her
and
that
in
fact
she
would
not
believe
any
thing
of
her
subjects
which
a
father
would
not
be
willing
to
believe
of
his
own
children
so
she
went
on
sailing
in
her
barge
just
as
before
illustration
portrait
of
queen
elizabeth
elizabeth
was
very
vain
of
her
beauty
though
unfortunately
she
had
very
little
beauty
to
be
vain
of
nothing
pleased
her
so
much
as
compliments
she
sometimes
almost
exacted
them
at
one
time
when
a
distinguished
embassador
from
mary
queen
of
scots
was
at
her
court
she
insisted
on
his
telling
her
whether
she
or
mary
was
the
most
beautiful
when
we
consider
that
elizabeth
was
at
this
time
over
thirty
years
of
age
and
mary
only
twentytwo
and
that
the
fame
of
marys
loveliness
had
filled
the
world
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
question
indicated
a
considerable
degree
of
selfcomplacency
the
embassador
had
the
prudence
to
attempt
to
evade
the
inquiry
he
said
at
first
that
they
were
both
beautiful
enough
but
elizabeth
wanted
to
know
she
said
which
was
most
beautiful
the
embassador
then
said
that
his
queen
was
the
most
beautiful
queen
in
scotland
and
elizabeth
in
england
elizabeth
was
not
satisfied
with
this
but
insisted
on
a
definite
answer
to
her
question
and
the
embassador
said
at
last
that
elizabeth
had
the
fairest
complexion
though
mary
was
considered
a
very
lovely
woman
elizabeth
then
wanted
to
know
which
was
the
tallest
of
the
two
the
embassador
said
that
mary
was
then
said
elizabeth
she
is
too
tall
for
i
am
just
of
the
right
height
myself
at
one
time
during
elizabeths
reign
the
people
took
a
fancy
to
engrave
and
print
portraits
of
her
which
being
perhaps
tolerably
faithful
to
the
original
were
not
very
alluring
the
queen
was
much
vexed
at
the
circulation
of
these
prints
and
finally
she
caused
a
grave
and
formal
proclamation
to
be
issued
against
them
in
this
proclamation
it
was
stated
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
queen
at
some
future
time
to
have
a
proper
artist
employed
to
execute
a
correct
and
true
portrait
of
herself
which
should
then
be
published
and
in
the
mean
time
all
persons
were
forbidden
to
make
or
sell
any
representations
of
her
whatever
elizabeth
was
extremely
fond
of
pomp
and
parade
the
magnificence
and
splendor
of
the
celebrations
and
festivities
which
characterized
her
reign
have
scarcely
ever
been
surpassed
in
any
country
or
in
any
age
she
once
went
to
attend
church
on
a
particular
occasion
accompanied
by
a
thousand
men
in
full
armor
of
steel
and
ten
pieces
of
cannon
with
drums
and
trumpets
sounding
she
received
her
foreign
embassadors
with
military
spectacles
and
shows
and
with
banquets
and
parties
of
pleasure
which
for
many
days
kept
all
london
in
a
fever
of
excitement
sometimes
she
made
excursions
on
the
river
with
whole
fleets
of
boats
and
barges
in
her
train
the
shores
on
such
occasions
swarming
with
spectators
and
waving
with
flags
and
banners
sometimes
she
would
make
grand
progresses
through
her
dominions
followed
by
an
army
of
attendantslords
and
ladies
dressed
and
mounted
in
the
most
costly
mannerand
putting
the
nobles
whose
seats
she
visited
to
a
vast
expense
in
entertaining
such
a
crowd
of
visitors
being
very
saving
of
her
own
means
she
generally
contrived
to
bring
the
expense
of
this
magnificence
upon
others
the
honor
was
a
sufficient
equivalent
or
if
it
was
not
nobody
dared
to
complain
to
sum
up
all
elizabeth
was
very
great
and
she
was
at
the
same
time
very
little
littleness
and
greatness
mingled
in
her
character
in
a
manner
which
has
scarcely
ever
been
paralleled
except
by
the
equally
singular
mixture
of
admiration
and
contempt
with
which
mankind
have
always
regarded

philip
of

was
the

leader

of
the
catholic
powers
and
he
prosecuted
his

exterminating

with

sternest
and

merciless
determination
obstinate

protracted
wars
cruel
tortures

marked

notwithstanding
all
this
however
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
country
increased
in
population
wealth
and
prosperity
it
is
after
all
but
a
very
small
proportion
of
fifty

of
people
which
the
most
cruel
monster
of
a
tyrant
can
kill
even
if
he
devotes
himself
fully
to
the
work
the
natural
deaths
among
the
vast
population
within
the
reach
of
philips
power
amounted
probably
to
two
millions
every
year
and
if
he
destroyed
ten
thousand
every
year
it
was
only
adding
one
death
by
violence
to
two
hundred
produced

dreadful
as
are
the
atrocities
of
persecution
and

and
vast
and
incalculable
as
are
the
encroachments
on

which
they
produce
we
are
often
led
to
overrate
their
relative
importance
compared
with
the
aggregate
value
of
the
interests
and
pursuits
which
are
left
unharmed
by
them
by
not
sufficiently
appreciating
the
enormous
extent
and
magnitude
of
these
interests
and
pursuits
in
such
communities
as
england
france
and
spain
sometimes
it
is
true
the
operations
of
military
heroes
have
been
on
such
a
prodigious
scale
as
to
make
very
serious
inroads
on
the
population
of
the
greatest
states
napoleon
for
instance
on
one
occasion
took
five
hundred
thousand
men
out
of
france
for
his
expedition
to
russia
the
campaign
destroyed
nearly
all
of
them
it
was
only
a
very
insignificant
fraction
of
the
vast
army
that
ever
returned
by
this
transaction
napoleon
thus
just
about
doubled
the
annual
mortality
in
france
at
a
single
blow
xerxes
enjoys
the
glory
of
having
destroyed
about
a
million
of
menand
these
not
enemies
but
countrymen
followers
and
friendsin
the
same
way
on
a
single
expedition
such
vast
results
however
were
not
attained
in
the
conflicts
which
marked
the
reigns
of
elizabeth
and
philip
of
spain
notwithstanding
the
longprotracted
international
wars
and
dreadful
civil
commotions
of
the
period
the
world
went
on
increasing
in
wealth
and
population
and
all
the
arts
and
improvements
of
life
made
very
rapid
progress
america
had
been
discovered
and
the
way
to
the
east
indies
had
been
opened
to
european
ships
and
the
spaniards
the
portuguese
the
dutch
the
english
and
the
french
had
fleets
of
merchant
vessels
and
ships
of
war
in
every
sea
the
spaniards
particularly
had
acquired
great
possessions
in
america
which
contained
very
rich
mines
of
gold
and
silver
and
there
was
a
particular
kind
of
vessels
called
galleons
which
went
regularly
once
a
year
under
a
strong
convoy
to
bring
home
the
treasure
they
used
to
call
these
fleets
armada
which
is
the
spanish
word
denoting
an
armed
squadron
nations
at
war
with
spain
always
made
great
efforts
to
intercept
and
seize
these
ships
on
their
homeward
voyages
when
being
laden
with
gold
and
silver
they
became
prizes
of
the
highest
value
things
were
in
this
state
about
the
year
when
queen
elizabeth
received
a
proposition
from
the
continent
of
europe
which
threw
her
into
great
perplexity
among
the
other
dominions
of
philip
of
spain
there
were
certain
states
situated
in
the
broad
tract
of
low
level
land
which
lies
northeast
of
france
and
which
constitutes
at
the
present
day
the
countries
of
holland
and
belgium
this
territory
was
then
divided
into
several
provinces
which
were
called
usually
the
low
countries
on
account
of
the
low
and
level
situation
of
the
land
in
fact
there
are
vast
tracts
of
land
bordering
the
shore
which
lie
so
low
that
dikes
have
to
be
built
to
keep
out
the
sea
in
these
cases
there
are
lines
of
windmills
of
great
size
and
power
all
along
the
coast
whose
vast
wings
are
always
slowly
revolving
to
pump
out
the
water
which
percolates
through
the
dikes
or
which
flows
from
the
watercourses
after
showers
of
rain
the
low
countries
were
very
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
tyrannical
government
which
philip
exercised
over
them
the
inhabitants
were
generally
protestants
and
philip
persecuted
them
cruelly
they
were
in
consequence
of
this
continually
rebelling
against
his
authority
and
elizabeth
secretly
aided
them
in
these
struggles
though
she
would
not
openly
assist
them
as
she
did
not
wish
to
provoke
philip
to
open
war
she
wished
them
success
however
for
she
knew
very
well
that
if
philip
could
once
subdue
his
protestant
subjects
at
home
he
would
immediately
turn
his
attention
to
england
and
perhaps
undertake
to
depose
elizabeth
and
place
some
catholic
prince
or
princess
upon
the
throne
in
her
stead
things
were
in
this
state
in
when
the
confederate
provinces
of
the
low
countries
sent
an
embassage
to
elizabeth
offering
her
the
government
of
the
country
as
sovereign
queen
if
she
would
openly
espouse
their
cause
and
protect
them
from
philips
power
this
proposition
called
for
very
serious
and
anxious
consideration
elizabeth
felt
very
desirous
to
make
this
addition
to
her
dominions
on
its
own
account
and
besides
she
saw
at
once
that
such
an
acquisition
would
give
her
a
great
advantage
in
her
future
contests
with
philip
if
actual
war
must
come
but
then
on
the
other
hand
by
accepting
the
proposition
war
must
necessarily
be
brought
on
at
once
philip
would
in
fact
consider
her
espousing
the
cause
of
his
rebellious
subjects
as
an
actual
declaration
of
war
on
her
part
so
that
making
such
a
league
with
these
countries
would
plunge
her
at
once
into
hostilities
with
the
greatest
and
most
extended
power
on
the
globe
elizabeth
was
very
unwilling
thus
to
precipitate
the
contest
but
then
on
the
other
hand
she
wished
very
much
to
avoid
the
danger
that
threatened
of
philips
first
subduing
his
own
dominions
and
then
advancing
to
the
invasion
of
england
with
his
undivided
strength
she
finally
concluded
not
to
accept
the
sovereignty
of
the
countries
but
to
make
a
league
offensive
and
defensive
with
the
governments
and
to
send
out
a
fleet
and
an
army
to
aid
them
this
as
she
had
expected
brought
on
a
general
war
the
queen
commissioned
leicester
to
take
command
of
the
forces
which
were
to
proceed
to
holland
and
the
netherlands
she
also
equipped
a
fleet
and
placed
it
under
the
command
of
sir
francis
drake
a
very
celebrated
naval
captain
to
proceed
across
the
atlantic
and
attack
the
spanish
possessions
on
the
american
shores
leicester
was
extremely
elated
with
his
appointment
and
set
off
on
his
expedition
with
great
pomp
and
parade
he
had
not
generally
during
his
life
held
stations
of
any
great
trust
or
responsibility
the
queen
had
conferred
upon
him
high
titles
and
vast
estates
but
she
had
confided
all
real
power
to
far
more
capable
and
trustworthy
hands
she
thought
however
perhaps
that
leicester
would
answer
for
her
allies
so
she
gave
him
his
commission
and
sent
him
forth
charging
him
with
many
injunctions
as
he
went
away
to
be
discreet
and
faithful
and
to
do
nothing
which
should
compromise
in
any
way
her
interests
or
honor
it
will
perhaps
be
recollected
that
leicesters
wife
had
been
before
her
marriage
with
him
the
wife
of
a
nobleman
named
the
earl
of
essex
she
had
a
son
who
at
his
fathers
death
succeeded
to
the
title
this
young
essex
accompanied
leicester
on
this
occasion
his
subsequent
adventures
which
were
romantic
and
extraordinary
will
be
narrated
in
the
next
chapter
the
people
of
the
netherlands
being
extremely
desirous
to
please
elizabeth
their
new
ally
thought
that
they
could
not
honor
the
great
general
she
had
sent
them
too
highly
they
received
him
with
most
magnificent
military
parades
and
passed
a
vote
in
their
assembly
investing
him
with
absolute
authority
as
head
of
the
government
thus
putting
him
in
fact
in
the
very
position
which
elizabeth
had
herself
declined
receiving
leicester
was
extremely
pleased
and
elated
with
these
honors
he
was
king
all
but
in
name
he
provided
himself
with
a
noble
lifeguard
in
imitation
of
royalty
and
assumed
all
the
state
and
airs
of
a
monarch
things
went
on
so
very
prosperously
with
him
for
a
short
time
until
he
was
one
day
thunderstruck
by
the
appearance
at
his
palace
of
a
nobleman
from
the
queens
court
named
heneage
who
brought
him
a
letter
from
elizabeth
which
was
in
substance
as
follows
how
foolishly
and
with
what
contempt
of
my
authority
i
think
you
have
acted
the
messenger
i
now
send
to
you
will
explain
i
little
imagined
that
a
man
whom
i
had
raised
from
the
dust
and
treated
with
so
much
favor
would
have
forgotten
all
his
obligations
and
acted
in
such
a
manner
i
command
you
now
to
put
yourself
entirely
under
the
direction
of
this
messenger
to
do
in
all
things
precisely
as
he
requires
upon
pain
of
further
peril
leicester
humbled
himself
immediately
under
this
rebuke
sent
home
most
ample
apologies
and
prayers
for
forgiveness
and
after
a
time
gradually
recovered
the
favor
of
the
queen
he
soon
however
became
very
unpopular
in
the
netherlands
grievous
complaints
were
made
against
him
and
he
was
at
length
recalled
drake
was
more
successful
he
was
a
bold
undaunted
and
energetic
seaman
but
unprincipled
and
merciless
he
manned
and
equipped
his
fleet
and
set
sail
toward
the
spanish
possessions
in
america
he
attacked
the
colonies
sacked
the
towns
plundered
the
inhabitants
intercepted
the
ships
and
searched
them
for
silver
and
gold
in
a
word
he
did
exactly
what
pirates
are
hung
for
doing
and
execrated
afterward
by
all
mankind
but
as
queen
elizabeth
gave
him
permission
to
perform
these
exploits
he
has
always
been
applauded
by
mankind
as
a
hero
we
would
not
be
understood
as
denying
that
there
is
any
difference
between
burning
and
plundering
innocent
towns
and
robbing
ships
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
governmental
permission
to
commit
these
crimes
there
certainly
is
a
difference
it
only
seems
to
us
surprising
that
there
should
be
so
great
a
difference
as
is
made
by
the
general
estimation
of
mankind
drake
in
fact
had
acquired
a
great
and
honorable
celebrity
for
such
deeds
before
this
time
by
a
similar
expedition
several
years
before
in
which
he
had
been
driven
to
make
the
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
england
and
spain
were
then
nominally
at
peace
and
the
expedition
was
really
in
pursuit
of
prizes
and
plunder
drake
took
five
vessels
with
him
on
this
his
first
expedition
but
they
were
all
very
small
the
largest
was
only
a
vessel
of
one
hundred
tons
while
the
ships
which
are
now
built
are
often
of
three
thousand
with
this
little
fleet
drake
set
sail
boldly
and
crossed
the
atlantic
being
fiftyfive
days
out
of
sight
of
land
he
arrived
at
last
on
the
coast
of
south
america
and
then
turned
his
course
southward
toward
the
straits
of
magellan
two
of
his
vessels
he
found
were
so
small
as
to
be
of
very
little
service
so
he
shipped
the
men
on
board
the
others
and
turned
the
two
adrift
when
he
got
well
into
the
southern
seas
he
charged
his
chief
mate
whose
name
was
doughty
with
some
offense
against
the
discipline
of
his
little
fleet
and
had
him
condemned
to
death
he
was
executed
at
the
straits
of
magellanbeheaded
before
he
died
the
unhappy
convict
had
the
sacrament
administered
to
him
drake
himself
partaking
of
it
with
him
it
was
said
and
believed
at
the
time
that
the
charge
against
doughty
was
only
a
pretense
and
that
the
real
cause
of
his
death
was
that
leicester
had
agreed
with
drake
to
kill
him
when
far
away
on
account
of
his
having
assisted
with
others
in
spreading
the
reports
that
leicester
had
murdered
the
earl
of
essex
the
former
husband
of
his
wife
the
little
squadron
passed
through
the
straits
of
magellan
and
then
encountered
a
dreadful
storm
which
separated
the
ships
and
drove
them
several
hundred
miles
to
the
westward
over
the
then
boundless
and
trackless
waters
of
the
pacific
ocean
drake
himself
afterward
recovered
the
shore
with
his
own
ship
alone
and
moved
northward
he
found
spanish
ships
and
spanish
merchants
every
where
who
not
dreaming
of
the
presence
of
an
english
enemy
in
those
distant
seas
were
entirely
secure
and
they
fell
one
after
another
a
very
easy
prey
the
very
extraordinary
story
is
told
of
his
finding
in
one
place
a
spaniard
asleep
upon
the
shore
waiting
perhaps
for
a
boat
with
thirty
bars
of
silver
by
his
side
of
great
weight
and
value
which
drake
and
his
men
seized
and
carried
off
without
so
much
as
waking
the
owner
in
one
harbor
which
he
entered
he
found
three
ships
from
which
the
seamen
had
all
gone
ashore
leaving
the
vessels
completely
unguarded
so
entirely
unconscious
were
they
of
any
danger
near
drake
broke
into
the
cabins
of
these
ships
and
found
fifty
or
sixty
wedges
of
pure
silver
there
of
twenty
pounds
each
in
this
way
as
he
passed
along
the
coast
he
collected
an
immense
treasure
in
silver
and
gold
both
coin
and
bullion
without
having
to
strike
a
blow
for
it
at
last
he
heard
of
a
very
rich
ship
called
the
cacofogo
which
had
recently
sailed
for
panama
to
which
place
they
were
taking
the
treasure
in
order
that
it
might
be
transported
across
the
isthmus
and
so
taken
home
to
spain
for
before
drakes
voyage
scarcely
a
single
vessel
had
ever
passed
round
cape
horn
the
ships
which
he
had
plundered
had
been
all
built
upon
the
coast
by
spaniards
who
had
come
across
the
country
at
the
isthmus
of
darien
and
were
to
be
used
only
to
transport
the
treasure
northward
where
it
could
be
taken
across
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
drake
gave
chase
to
the
cacofogo
at
last
he
came
near
enough
to
fire
into
her
and
one
of
his
first
shots
cut
away
her
foremast
and
disabled
her
he
soon
captured
the
ship
and
he
found
immense
riches
on
board
besides
pearls
and
precious
stones
of
great
value
there
were
eighty
pounds
of
gold
thirteen
chests
of
silver
coin
and
silver
enough
in
bars
to
ballast
a
ship
drakes
vessel
was
now
richly
laden
with
treasures
but
in
the
mean
time
the
news
of
his
plunderings
had
gone
across
the
continent
and
some
spanish
ships
of
war
had
gone
south
to
intercept
him
at
the
straits
of
magellan
on
his
return
in
this
dilemma
the
adventurous
sailor
conceived
of
the
sublime
idea
of
avoiding
them
by
going
round
the
world
to
get
home
he
pushed
boldly
forward
therefore
across
the
pacific
ocean
to
the
east
indies
thence
through
the
indian
ocean
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
after
three
years
from
the
time
he
left
england
he
returned
to
it
safely
again
his
ship
loaded
with
the
plundered
silver
and
gold
as
soon
as
he
arrived
in
the
thames
the
whole
world
flocked
to
see
the
little
ship
that
had
performed
all
these
wonders
the
vessel
was
drawn
up
alongside
the
land
and
a
bridge
made
to
it
and
after
the
treasure
was
taken
out
it
was
given
up
for
some
time
to
banquetings
and
celebrations
of
every
kind
the
queen
took
possession
of
all
the
treasure
saying
that
philip
might
demand
it
and
she
be
forced
to
make
restitution
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
all
this
took
place
several
years
before
the
war
she
however
treated
the
successful
sailor
with
every
mark
of
consideration
and
honor
she
went
herself
on
board
his
ship
and
partook
of
an
entertainment
there
conferring
the
honor
of
knighthood
at
the
same
time
on
the
admiral
so
that
sir
francis
drake
was
thenceforth
his
proper
title
if
the
facts
already
stated
do
not
give
sufficient
indications
of
the
kind
of
character
which
in
those
days
made
a
naval
hero
one
other
circumstance
may
be
added
at
one
time
during
this
voyage
a
spaniard
whose
ship
drake
had
spared
made
him
a
present
of
a
beautiful
negro
girl
drake
kept
her
on
board
his
ship
for
a
time
and
then
sent
her
ashore
on
some
island
that
he
was
passing
and
inhumanly
abandoned
her
there
to
become
a
mother
among
strangers
utterly
friendless
and
alone
it
must
be
added
however
in
justice
to
the
rude
men
among
whom
this
wild
buccaneer
lived
that
though
they
praised
all
his
other
deeds
of
violence
and
wrong
this
atrocious
cruelty
was
condemned
it
had
the
effect
even
in
those
days
of
tarnishing
his
fame
philip
did
claim
the
money
but
elizabeth
found
plenty
of
good
excuses
for
not
paying
it
over
to
him
this
celebrated
expedition
occupied
more
than
three
years
going
round
the
world
is
a
long
journey
the
arrival
of
the
ship
in
london
took
place
in
four
years
before
the
war
actually
broke
out
between
england
and
spain
which
was
in
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
great
celebrity
which
drake
had
acquired
in
this
and
similar
excursions
that
when
at
last
hostilities
commenced
he
was
put
in
command
of
the
naval
preparations
it
was
not
long
before
it
was
found
that
his
services
were
likely
to
be
required
near
home
for
rumors
began
to
find
their
way
to
england
that
philip
was
preparing
a
great
fleet
for
the
actual
invasion
of
england
the
news
put
the
whole
country
into
a
state
of
great
alarm
the
reader
in
order
to
understand
fully
the
grounds
for
this
alarm
must
remember
that
in
those
days
spain
was
the
mistress
of
the
ocean
and
not
england
herself
spain
possessed
the
distant
colonies
and
the
foreign
commerce
and
built
and
armed
the
great
ships
while
england
had
comparatively
few
ships
and
those
which
she
had
were
small
to
meet
the
formidable
preparations
which
the
spaniards
were
making
elizabeth
equipped
only
four
ships
to
these
however
the
merchants
of
london
added
twenty
or
thirty
more
of
various
sizes
which
they
furnished
on
condition
of
having
a
share
in
the
plunder
which
they
hoped
would
be
secured
the
whole
fleet
was
put
under
drakes
command
robbers
and
murderers
whether
those
that
operate
upon
the
sea
or
on
the
land
are
generally
courageous
and
drakes
former
success
had
made
him
feel
doubly
confident
and
strong
philip
had
collected
a
considerable
fleet
of
ships
in
cadiz
which
is
a
strong
seaport
in
the
southeastern
part
of
spain
on
the
mediterranean
sea
and
others
were
assembling
in
all
the
ports
and
bays
along
the
shore
wherever
they
could
be
built
or
purchased
they
were
to
rendezvous
finally
at
cadiz
drake
pushed
boldly
forward
and
to
the
astonishment
of
the
world
forced
his
way
into
the
harbor
through
a
squadron
of
galleys
stationed
there
to
protect
the
entrance
and
burned
sunk
and
destroyed
more
than
a
hundred
ships
which
had
been
collected
there
the
whole
work
was
done
and
the
little
english
fleet
was
off
again
before
the
spaniards
could
recover
from
their
astonishment
drake
then
sailed
along
the
coast
seizing
and
destroying
all
the
ships
he
could
find
he
next
pushed
to
sea
a
little
way
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
intercept
and
capture
a
richlyladen
ship
of
very
large
size
called
a
carrack
which
was
coming
home
from
the
east
indies
he
then
went
back
to
england
in
triumph
he
said
he
had
been
singeing
the
whiskers
of
the
king
of
spain
the
booty
was
divided
among
the
london
merchants
as
had
been
agreed
upon
philip
was
exasperated
and
enraged
beyond
expression
at
this
unexpected
destruction
of
armaments
which
had
cost
him
so
much
time
and
money
to
prepare
his
spirit
was
irritated
and
aroused
by
the
disaster
not
quelled
and
he
immediately
began
to
renew
his
preparations
making
them
now
on
a
still
vaster
scale
than
before
the
amount
of
damage
which
drake
effected
was
therefore
after
all
of
no
greater
benefit
to
england
than
putting
back
the
invasion
for
about
a
year
at
length
in
the
summer
of
the
preparations
for
the
sailing
of
the
great
armada
which
was
to
dethrone
elizabeth
and
bring
back
the
english
nation
again
under
the
dominion
of
some
papal
prince
and
put
down
finally
the
cause
of
protestantism
in
europe
were
complete
elizabeth
herself
and
the
english
people
in
the
mean
time
had
not
been
idle
the
whole
kingdom
had
been
for
months
filled
with
enthusiasm
to
prepare
for
meeting
the
foe
armies
were
levied
and
fleets
raised
every
maritime
town
furnished
ships
and
rich
noblemen
in
many
cases
built
or
purchased
vessels
with
their
own
funds
and
sent
them
forward
ready
for
the
battle
as
their
contribution
toward
the
means
of
defense
a
large
part
of
the
force
thus
raised
was
stationed
at
plymouth
which
is
the
first
great
seaport
which
presents
itself
on
the
english
coast
in
sailing
up
the
channel
the
remainder
of
it
was
stationed
at
the
other
end
of
the
channel
near
the
straits
of
dover
for
it
was
feared
that
in
addition
to
the
vast
armament
which
philip
was
to
bring
from
spain
he
would
raise
another
fleet
in
the
netherlands
which
would
of
course
approach
the
shores
of
england
from
the
german
ocean
besides
the
fleets
a
large
army
was
raised
twenty
thousand
men
were
distributed
along
the
southern
shores
of
england
in
such
positions
as
to
be
most
easily
concentrated
at
any
point
where
the
armada
might
attempt
to
land
and
about
as
many
more
were
marched
down
the
thames
and
encamped
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
to
guard
that
access
this
encampment
was
at
a
place
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
just
above
its
mouth
leicester
strange
as
it
may
seem
was
put
in
command
of
this
army
the
queen
however
herself
went
to
visit
this
encampment
and
reviewed
the
troops
in
person
she
rode
to
and
fro
on
horseback
along
the
lines
armed
like
a
warrior
at
least
she
had
a
corslet
of
polished
steel
over
her
magnificent
dress
and
bore
a
generals
truncheon
a
richlyornamented
staff
used
as
a
badge
of
command
she
had
a
helmet
too
with
a
white
plume
this
however
she
did
not
wear
a
page
bore
it
following
her
while
she
rode
attended
by
leicester
and
the
other
generals
all
mounted
on
horses
and
splendidly
caparisoned
from
rank
to
rank
animating
the
men
to
the
highest
enthusiasm
by
her
courageous
bearing
her
look
of
confidence
and
her
smiles
she
made
an
address
to
the
soldiers
she
said
that
she
had
been
warned
by
some
of
her
ministers
of
the
danger
of
trusting
herself
to
the
power
of
such
an
armed
multitude
for
these
forces
were
not
regularly
enlisted
troops
but
volunteers
from
among
the
citizens
who
had
suddenly
left
the
ordinary
avocations
and
pursuits
of
life
to
defend
their
country
in
this
emergency
she
had
however
she
said
no
such
apprehensions
of
danger
she
could
trust
herself
without
fear
to
the
courage
and
fidelity
of
her
subjects
as
she
had
always
during
all
her
reign
considered
her
greatest
strength
and
safeguard
as
consisting
in
their
loyalty
and
good
will
for
herself
she
had
come
to
the
camp
she
assured
them
not
for
the
sake
of
empty
pageantry
and
parade
but
to
take
her
share
with
them
in
the
dangers
and
toils
and
terrors
of
the
actual
battle
if
philip
should
land
they
would
find
their
queen
in
the
hottest
of
the
conflict
fighting
by
their
sides
i
have
said
she
i
know
only
the
body
of
a
weak
and
feeble
woman
but
i
have
the
heart
of
a
king
and
i
am
ready
for
my
god
my
kingdom
and
my
people
to
have
that
body
laid
down
even
in
the
dust
if
the
battle
comes
therefore
i
shall
myself
be
in
the
midst
and
front
of
it
to
live
or
die
with
you
these
were
thus
far
but
words
it
is
true
and
how
far
elizabeth
would
have
vindicated
their
sincerity
if
the
entrance
of
the
armada
into
the
thames
had
put
her
to
the
test
we
can
not
now
know
sir
francis
drake
saved
her
from
the
trial
one
morning
a
small
vessel
came
into
the
harbor
at
plymouth
where
the
english
fleet
was
lying
with
the
news
that
the
armada
was
coming
up
the
channel
under
full
sail
the
anchors
of
the
fleet
were
immediately
raised
and
great
exertions
made
to
get
it
out
of
the
harbor
which
was
difficult
as
the
wind
at
the
time
was
blowing
directly
in
the
squadron
got
out
at
last
as
night
was
coming
on
the
next
morning
the
armada
hove
in
sight
advancing
from
the
westward
up
the
channel
in
a
vast
crescent
which
extended
for
seven
miles
from
north
to
south
and
seemed
to
sweep
the
whole
sea
illustration
the
invincible
armada
it
was
a
magnificent
spectacle
and
it
was
the
ushering
in
of
that
far
grander
spectacle
still
of
which
the
english
channel
was
the
scene
for
the
ten
days
which
followed
during
which
the
enormous
naval
structures
of
the
armada
as
they
slowly
made
their
way
along
were
followed
and
fired
upon
and
harassed
by
the
smaller
and
lighter
and
more
active
vessels
of
their
english
foes
the
unwieldy
monsters
pressed
on
surrounded
and
worried
by
their
nimbler
enemies
like
hawks
driven
by
kingfishers
through
the
sky
day
after
day
this
most
extraordinary
contest
half
flight
and
half
battle
continued
every
promontory
on
the
shores
covered
all
the
time
with
spectators
who
listened
to
the
distant
booming
of
the
guns
and
watched
the
smokes
which
arose
from
the
cannonading
and
the
conflagrations
one
great
galleon
after
another
fell
a
prey
some
were
burned
some
taken
as
prizes
some
driven
ashore
and
finally
one
dark
night
the
english
sent
a
fleet
of
fireships
all
in
flames
into
the
midst
of
the
anchorage
to
which
the
spaniards
had
retired
which
scattered
them
in
terror
and
dismay
and
completed
the
discomfiture
of
the
squadron
the
result
was
that
by
the
time
the
invincible
armada
had
made
its
way
through
the
channel
and
had
passed
the
straits
of
dover
it
was
so
dispersed
and
shattered
and
broken
that
its
commanders
far
from
feeling
any
disposition
to
sail
up
the
thames
were
only
anxious
to
make
good
their
escape
from
their
indefatigable
and
tormenting
foes
they
did
not
dare
in
attempting
to
make
this
escape
to
return
through
the
channel
so
they
pushed
northward
into
the
german
ocean
their
only
course
for
getting
back
to
spain
again
was
to
pass
round
the
northern
side
of

the
lady
whom
the
earl
of
leicester
married
was
a
short
time
before
he
married
her
the
wife
of
the
earl
of
essex
and
she
had
one
son
who
on
the
death
of
his
father
became
the
earl
of
essex
in
his
turn
he
came
to
court
and
continued
in
leicesters
family
after
his
mothers
second
marriage
he
was
an
accomplished
and
elegant
young
man
and
was
regarded
with
a
good
deal
of
favor
by
the
queen
he
was
introduced
at
court
when
he
was
but
seventeen
years
old
and
being
the
stepson
of
leicester
he
necessarily
occupied
a
conspicuous
position
his
personal
qualities
joined
with
this
soon
gave
him
a
very
high
and
honorable
name
about
a
month
after
the
victory
obtained
by
the
english
over
the
invincible
armada
leicester
was
seized
with
a
fever
on
a
journey
and
after
lingering
for
a
few
days
died
leaving
essex
as
it
were
in
his
place
elizabeth
seems
not
to
have
been
very
inconsolable
for
her
favorites
death
she
directed
or
allowed
his
property
to
be
sold
at
auction
to
pay
some
debts
which
he
owed
heror
as
the
historians
of
the
day
express
it
which
he
owed
the
crownand
then
seemed
at
once
to
transfer
her
fondness
and
affection
to
the
young
essex
who
was
at
that
time
twentyone
years
of
age
elizabeth
herself
was
now
nearly
sixty
cecil
was
growing
old
also
and
was
somewhat
infirm
though
he
had
a
son
who
was
rapidly
coming
forward
in
rank
and
influence
at
court
this
sons
name
was
robert
the
young
earl
of
essexs
name
was
robert
too
the
elder
cecil
and
leicester
had
been
all
their
lives
watchful
and
jealous
of
each
other
and
in
some
sense
rivals
robert
cecil
and
robert
devereuxfor
that
was
in
full
the
earl
of
essexs
family
namebeing
young
and
ardent
inherited
the
animosity
of
their
parents
and
were
less
cautious
and
wary
in
expressing
it
they
soon
became
open
foes
robert
devereux
or
essex
as
he
is
commonly
called
in
history
was
handsome
and
accomplished
ardent
impulsive
and
generous
the
war
with
spain
notwithstanding
the
destruction
of
the
armada
continued
and
essex
entered
into
it
with
all
zeal
the
queen
who
with
all
her
ambition
and
her
proud
and
domineering
spirit
felt
like
any
other
woman
the
necessity
of
having
something
to
love
soon
began
to
take
a
strong
interest
in
his
person
and
fortunes
and
seemed
to
love
him
as
a
mother
loves
a
son
and
he
in
his
turn
soon
learned
to
act
toward
her
as
a
son
full
of
youthful
courage
and
ardor
often
acts
toward
a
mother
over
whose
heart
he
feels
that
he
has
a
strong
control
he
would
go
away
without
leave
to
mix
in
affrays
with
the
spanish
ships
in
the
english
channel
and
in
the
bay
of
biscay
and
then
come
back
and
make
his
peace
with
the
queen
by
very
humble
petitions
for
pardon
and
promises
of
future
obedience
when
he
went
with
her
leave
on
these
expeditions
she
would
charge
his
superior
officers
to
keep
him
out
of
danger
while
he
with
an
impetuosity
which
strongly
marked
his
character
would
evade
and
escape
from
all
these
injunctions
and
press
forward
into
every
possible
exposure
always
eager
to
have
battle
given
and
to
get
himself
into
the
hottest
part
of
it
when
it
was
begun
at
one
time
off
cadiz
the
officers
of
the
english
ships
hesitated
some
time
whether
to
venture
an
attack
upon
some
ships
in
the
harboressex
burning
with
impatience
all
the
timeand
when
it
was
at
length
decided
to
make
the
attack
he
was
so
excited
with
enthusiasm
and
pleasure
that
he
threw
his
cap
up
into
the
air
and
overboard
perfectly
wild
with
delight
like
a
schoolboy
in
anticipation
of
a
holiday
ten
years
passed
away
and
essex
rose
higher
and
higher
in
estimation
and
honor
he
was
sometimes
in
the
queens
palaces
at
home
and
sometimes
away
on
the
spanish
seas
where
he
acquired
great
fame
he
was
proud
and
imperious
at
court
relying
on
his
influence
with
the
queen
who
treated
him
as
a
fond
mother
treats
a
spoiled
child
she
was
often
vexed
with
his
conduct
but
she
could
not
help
loving
him
one
day
as
he
was
coming
into
the
queens
presence
chamber
he
saw
one
of
the
courtiers
there
who
had
a
golden
ornament
upon
his
arm
which
the
queen
had
given
him
the
day
before
he
asked
what
it
was
they
told
him
it
was
a
favor
from
the
queen
ah
said
he
i
see
how
it
is
going
to
be
every
fool
must
have
his
favor
the
courtier
resented
this
mode
of
speaking
of
his
distinction
and
challenged
essex
to
a
duel
the
combatants
met
in
the
park
and
essex
was
disarmed
and
wounded
the
queen
heard
of
the
affair
and
after
inquiring
very
curiously
about
all
the
particulars
she
said
that
she
was
glad
of
it
for
unless
there
was
somebody
to
take
down
his
pride
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
doing
any
thing
with
him
elizabeths
feelings
toward
essex
fluctuated
in
strange
alternations
of
fondness
and
displeasure
at
one
time
when
affection
was
in
the
ascendency
she
gave
him
a
ring
as
a
talisman
of
her
protection
she
promised
him
that
if
he
ever
should
become
involved
in
troubles
or
difficulties
of
any
kind
and
especially
if
he
should
lose
her
favor
either
by
his
own
misconduct
or
by
the
false
accusations
of
his
enemies
if
he
would
send
her
that
ring
it
should
serve
to
recall
her
former
kind
regard
and
incline
her
to
pardon
and
save
him
essex
took
the
ring
and
preserved
it
with
the
utmost
care
friendship
between
persons
of
such
impetuous
and
excitable
temperaments
as
elizabeth
and
essex
both
possessed
though
usually
very
ardent
for
a
time
is
very
precarious
and
uncertain
in
duration
after
various
petulant
and
brief
disputes
which
were
easily
reconciled
there
came
at
length
a
serious
quarrel
there
was
at
that
time
great
difficulty
in
ireland
a
rebellion
had
broken
out
in
fact
which
was
fomented
and
encouraged
by
spanish
influence
essex
was
one
day
urging
very
strongly
the
appointment
of
one
of
his
friends
to
take
the
command
there
while
the
queen
was
disposed
to
appoint
another
person
essex
urged
his
views
and
wishes
with
much
importunity
and
when
he
found
that
the
queen
was
determined
not
to
yield
he
turned
his
back
upon
her
in
a
contemptuous
and
angry
manner
the
queen
lost
patience
in
her
turn
and
advancing
rapidly
to
him
her
eyes
sparkling
with
extreme
resentment
and
displeasure
she
gave
him
a
severe
box
on
the
ear
telling
him
at
the
same
time
to
go
and
be
hanged
essex
was
exceedingly
enraged
he
clasped
the
handle
of
his
sword
but
was
immediately
seized
by
the
other
courtiers
present
they
however
soon
released
their
hold
upon
him
and
he
walked
off
out
of
the
apartment
saying
that
he
could
not
and
would
not
bear
such
an
insult
as
that
he
would
not
have
endured
it
he
said
from
king
henry
the
eighth
himself
the
name
of
king
henry
the
eighth
in
those
days
was
the
symbol
and
personification
of
the
highest
possible
human
grandeur
the
friends
of
essex
among
the
courtiers
endeavored
to
soothe
and
calm
him
and
to
persuade
him
to
apologize
to
the
queen
and
seek
a
reconciliation
they
told
him
that
whether
right
or
wrong
he
ought
to
yield
for
in
contests
with
the
law
or
with
a
prince
a
man
they
said
ought
if
wrong
to
submit
himself
to
justice
if
right
to
necessity
in
either
case
it
was
his
duty
to
submit
this
was
very
good
philosophy
but
essex
was
not
in
a
state
of
mind
to
listen
to
philosophy
he
wrote
a
reply
to
the
friend
who
had
counseled
him
as
above
that
the
queen
had
the
temper
of
a
flint
that
she
had
treated
him
with
such
extreme
injustice
and
cruelty
so
many
times
that
his
patience
was
exhausted
and
he
would
bear
it
no
longer
he
knew
well
enough
what
duties
he
owed
the
queen
as
an
earl
and
grand
marshal
of
england
but
he
did
not
understand
being
cuffed
and
beaten
like
a
menial
servant
and
that
his
body
suffered
in
every
part
from
the
blow
he
had
received
his
resentment
however
got
soothed
and
softened
in
time
and
he
was
again
admitted
to
favor
though
the
consequences
of
such
quarrels
are
seldom
fully
repaired
the
reconciliation
was
however
in
this
case
apparently
complete
and
in
the
following
year
essex
was
himself
appointed
the
governor
or
as
styled
in
those
days
the
lord
deputy
of
ireland
he
went
to
his
province
and
took
command
of
the
forces
which
had
been
collected
there
and
engaged
zealously
in
the
work
of
suppressing
the
rebellion
for
some
reason
or
other
however
he
made
very
little
progress
the
name
of
the
leader
of
the
rebels
was
the
earl
of
tyroned
tyrone
wanted
a
parley
but
did
not
dare
to
trust
himself
in
essexs
power
it
was
at
last
however
agreed
that
the
two
leaders
should
come
down
to
a
river
one
of
them
upon
each
side
and
talk
across
it
neither
general
to
have
any
troops
or
attendants
with
him
this
plan
was
carried
into
effect
essex
stationing
a
troop
near
him
on
a
hill
rode
down
to
the
water
on
one
side
while
tyrone
came
into
the
river
as
far
as
his
horse
could
wade
on
the
other
and
then
the
two
earls
attempted
to
negotiate
terms
of
peace
by
shouting
across
the
current
of
the
stream
footnote
d
spelled
in
the
old
histories
tiroen
nothing
effectual
was
accomplished
by
this
and
some
other
similar
parleys
and
in
the
mean
time
the
weeks
were
passing
away
and
little
was
done
toward
suppressing
the
rebellion
the
queen
was
dissatisfied
she
sent
essex
letters
of
complaint
and
censure
these
letters
awakened
the
lord
deputys
resentment
the
breach
was
thus
rapidly
widening
when
essex
all
at
once
conceived
the
idea
of
going
himself
to
england
without
permission
and
without
giving
any
notice
of
his
intention
to
endeavor
by
a
personal
interview
to
reinstate
himself
in
the
favor
of
the
queen
illustration
the
house
of
the
earl
of
essex
this
was
a
very
bold
step
it
was
entirely
contrary
to
military
etiquette
for
an
officer
to
leave
his
command
and
go
home
to
his
sovereign
without
orders
and
without
permission
the
plan
however
might
have
succeeded
leicester
did
once
succeed
in
such
a
measure
but
in
this
case
unfortunately
it
failed
essex
traveled
with
the
utmost
dispatch
crossed
the
channel
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
palace
where
the
queen
was
then
residing
and
pressed
through
the
opposition
of
all
the
attendants
into
the
queens
private
apartment
in
his
traveling
dress
soiled
and
wayworn
the
queen
was
at
her
toilet
with
her
hair
down
over
her
eyes
essex
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
kissed
her
hand
and
made
great
professions
of
gratitude
and
love
and
of
an
extreme
desire
to
deserve
and
enjoy
her
favor
the
queen
was
astonished
at
his
appearance
but
essex
thought
that
she
received
him
kindly
he
went
away
after
a
short
interview
greatly
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
a
favorable
issue
to
the
desperate
step
he
had
taken
his
joy
however
was
soon
dispelled
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
was
arrested
by
order
of
the
queen
and
sent
to
his
house
under
the
custody
of
an
officer
he
had
presumed
too
far
essex
was
kept
thus
secluded
and
confined
for
some
time
his
house
was
on
the
bank
of
the
river
none
of
his
friends
not
even
his
countess
were
allowed
access
to
him
his
impetuous
spirit
wore
itself
out
in
chafing
against
the
restraints
and
means
of
coercion
which
were
pressing
upon
him
but
he
would
not
submit
the
mind
of
the
queen
too
was
deeply
agitated
all
the
time
by
that
most
tempestuous
of
all
mental
conflicts
a
struggle
between
resentment
and
love
her
affection
for
her
proudspirited
favorite
seemed
as
strong
as
ever
but
she
was
determined
to
make
him
yield
in
the
contest
she
had
commenced
with
him
how
often
cases
precisely
similar
occur
in
less
conspicuous
scenes
of
action
where
they
who
love
each
other
with
a
sincere
and
uncontrollable
affection
take
their
stand
in
attitudes
of
hostility
each
determined
that
the
obstinacy
of
the
other
shall
give
way
and
each
heart
persisting
in
its
own
determination
resentment
and
love
struggling
all
the
time
in
a
dreadful
contest
which
keeps
the
soul
in
a
perpetual
commotion
and
allows
of
no
peace
till
either
the
obstinacy
yields
or
the
love
is
extinguished
and
gone
it
was
indirectly
made
known
to
essex
that
if
he
would
confess
his
fault
ask
the
queens
forgiveness
and
petition
for
a
release
from
confinement
in
order
that
he
might
return
to
his
duties
in
ireland
the
difficulty
could
be
settled
but
no
he
would
make
no
concessions
the
queen
in
retaliation
increased
the
pressure
upon
him
the
more
strongly
he
felt
the
pressure
the
more
his
proud
and
resentful
spirit
was
aroused
he
walked
his
room
his
soul
boiling
with
anger
and
chagrin
while
the
queen
equally
distressed
and
harassed
by
the
conflict
in
her
own
soul
still
persevered
hoping
every
day
that
the
unbending
spirit
with
which
she
was
contending
would
yield
at
last
at
length
the
tidings
came
to
her
that
essex
worn
out
with
agitation
and
suffering
was
seriously
sick
the
historians
doubt
whether
his
sickness
was
real
or
feigned
but
there
is
not
much
difficulty
in
understanding
from
the
circumstances
of
the
case
what
its
real
nature
was
such
mental
conflicts
as
those
which
he
endured
suspend
the
powers
of
digestion
and
accelerate
the
pulsations
of
the
heart
which
beats
in
the
bosom
with
a
preternatural
frequency
and
force
like
a
bird
fluttering
to
get
free
from
a
snare
the
result
is
a
sort
of
fever
burning
slowly
in
the
veins
and
an
emaciation
which
wastes
the
strength
away
and
in
impetuous
and
uncontrollable
spirits
like
that
of
essex
sometimes
exhausts
the
powers
of
life
altogether
the
sickness
therefore
though
of
mental
origin
becomes
bodily
and
real
but
then
the
sufferer
is
often
ready
in
such
cases
to
add
a
little
to
it
by
feigning
an
instinct
teaches
him
that
nothing
is
so
likely
to
move
the
heart
whose
cruelty
causes
him
to
suffer
as
a
knowledge
of
the
extreme
to
which
it
has
reduced
him
essex
was
doubtless
willing
that
elizabeth
should
know
that
he
was
sick
her
knowing
it
had
in
some
measure
the
usual
effect
it
reawakened
and
strengthened
the
love
she
had
felt
for
him
but
did
not
give
it
absolutely
the
victory
she
sent
eight
physicians
to
him
to
examine
and
consult
upon
his
case
she
caused
some
broth
to
be
made
for
him
and
gave
it
to
one
of
these
physicians
to
carry
to
him
directing
the
messenger
in
a
faltering
voice
to
say
to
essex
that
if
it
were
proper
to
do
so
she
would
have
come
to
see
him
herself
she
then
turned
away
to
hide
her
tears
strange
inconsistency
of
the
human
heartresentment
and
anger
holding
their
ground
in
the
soul
against
the
object
of
such
deep
and
unconquerable
love
it
would
be
incredible
were
it
not
that
probably
every
single
one
of
all
the
thousands
who
may
read
this
story
has
experienced
the
same
nothing
has
so
great
an
effect
in
awakening
in
the
heart
a
strong
sentiment
of
kindness
as
the
performance
of
a
kind
act
feeling
originates
and
controls
action
it
is
true
but
then
on
the
other
hand
action
has
a
prodigious
power
in
modifying
feeling
elizabeths
acts
of
kindness
to
essex
in
his
sickness
produced
a
renewal
of
her
tenderness
for
him
so
strong
that
her
obstinacy
and
anger
gave
way
before
it
and
she
soon
began
to
desire
some
mode
of
releasing
him
from
his
confinement
and
restoring
him
to
favor
essex
was
softened
too
in
a
word
there
was
finally
a
reconciliation
though
it
was
accomplished
by
slow
degrees
and
by
means
of
a
sort
of
series
of
capitulations
there
was
an
investigation
of
his
case
before
the
privy
council
which
resulted
in
a
condemnation
of
his
conduct
and
a
recommendation
to
the
mercy
of
the
queen
and
then
followed
some
communications
between
essex
and
his
sovereign
in
which
he
expressed
sorrow
for
his
faults
and
made
satisfactory
promises
for
the
future
the
queen
however
had
not
magnanimity
enough
to
let
the
quarrel
end
without
taunting
and
irritating
the
penitent
with
expressions
of
triumph
in
reply
to
his
acknowledgments
and
professions
she
told
him
that
she
was
glad
to
hear
of
his
good
intentions
and
she
hoped
that
he
would
show
by
his
future
conduct
that
he
meant
to
fulfill
them
that
he
had
tried
her
patience
for
a
long
time
but
she
hoped
that
henceforth
she
should
have
no
further
trouble
if
it
had
been
her
father
she
added
instead
of
herself
that
he
had
had
to
deal
with
he
would
not
have
been
pardoned
at
all
it
could
not
be
a
very
cordial
reconciliation
which
was
consummated
by
such
words
as
these
but
it
was
very
like
elizabeth
to
utter
them
they
who
are
governed
by
their
temper
are
governed
by
it
even
in
their
love
essex
was
not
restored
to
office
in
fact
he
did
not
wish
to
be
restored
he
said
that
he
was
resolved
henceforth
to
lead
a
private
life
but
even
in
respect
to
this
plan
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
queen
for
his
private
income
was
in
a
great
measure
derived
from
a
monopoly
as
it
is
called
in
a
certain
kind
of
wines
which
had
been
granted
to
him
some
time
before
it
was
a
very
customary
mode
in
those
days
of
enriching
favorites
to
grant
them
monopolies
of
certain
kinds
of
merchandise
that
is
the
exclusive
right
to
sell
them
the
persons
to
whom
this
privilege
was
granted
would
underlet
their
right
to
merchants
in
various
parts
of
the
kingdom
on
condition
of
receiving
a
certain
share
of
the
profits
essex
had
thus
derived
a
great
revenue
from
his
monopoly
of
wines
the
grant
however
was
expiring
and
he
petitioned
the
queen
that
it
might
be
renewed
the
interest
which
essex
felt
in
the
renewal
of
this
grant
was
one
of
the
strongest
inducements
to
lead
him
to
submit
to
the
humiliations
which
he
had
endured
and
to
make
concessions
to
the
queen
but
he
was
disappointed
in
his
hopes
the
queen
elated
a
little
with
the
triumph
already
attained
and
perhaps
desirous
of
the
pleasure
of
humbling
essex
still
more
refused
at
present
to
renew
his
monopoly
saying
that
she
thought
it
would
do
him
good
to
be
restricted
a
little
for
a
time
in
his
means
unmanageable
beasts
she
said
had
to
be
tamed
by
being
stinted
in
their
provender
essex
was
sharply
stung
by
such
a
refusal
accompanied
too
by
such
an
insult
he
was
full
of
indignation
and
anger
at
first
he
gave
free
expression
to
his
feelings
of
vexation
in
conversation
with
those
around
him
the
queen
he
said
had
got
to
be
a
perverse
and
obstinate
old
woman
as
crooked
in
mind
as
she
was
in
body
he
had
plenty
of
enemies
to
listen
to
these
speeches
and
to
report
them
in
such
a
way
as
that
they
should
reach
the
queen
a
new
breach
was
consequently
opened
which
seemed
now
wider
than
ever
and
irreparable
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
essex
and
abandoning
all
plans
for
again
enjoying
the
favor
of
elizabeth
he
began
to
consider
what
he
could
do
to
undermine
her
power
and
rise
upon
the
ruins
of
it
the
idea
was
insanity
but
passion
always
makes
men
insane
james
king
of
scotland
the
son
and
successor
of
mary
was
the
rightful
heir
to
the
english
throne
after
elizabeths
death
in
order
to
make
his
right
of
succession
more
secure
he
had
wished
to
have
elizabeth
acknowledge
it
but
she
always
dreading
terribly
the
thoughts
of
death
could
never
bear
to
think
of
a
successor
and
seemed
to
hate
every
one
who
entertained
any
expectation
of
following
her
essex
suppressed
all
outward
expressions
of
violence
and
anger
became
thoughtful
moody
and
sullen
held
secret
consultations
with
desperate
intriguers
and
finally
formed
a
scheme
to
organize
a
rebellion
to
bring
king
jamess
troops
to
england
to
support
it
to
take
possession
of
the
tower
and
of
the
strongholds
about
london
to
seize
the
palace
of
the
queen
overturn
her
government
and
compel
her
both
to
acknowledge
jamess
right
to
the
succession
and
to
restore
essex
himself
to
power
the
personal
character
of
essex
had
given
him
a
very
widespread
popularity
and
influence
and
he
had
consequently
very
extensive
materials
at
his
command
for
organizing
a
powerful
conspiracy
the
plot
was
gradually
matured
extending
itself
in
the
course
of
the
few
following
months
not
only
throughout
england
but
also
into
france
and
spain
the
time
for
the
final
explosion
was
drawing
near
when
as
usual
in
such
cases
intelligence
of
the
existence
of
this
treason
in
the
form
of
vague
rumors
reached
the
queen
one
day
when
the
leading
conspirators
were
assembled
at
essexs
palace
a
messenger
came
to
summon
the
earl
to
appear
before
the
council
they
received
also
private
intelligence
that
their
plots
were
probably
discovered
while
they
were
considering
what
to
do
in
this
emergencyall
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
and
feara
person
came
pretending
to
be
a
deputy
sent
from
some
of
the
principal
citizens
of
london
to
say
to
essex
that
they
were
ready
to
espouse
his
cause
essex
immediately
became
urgent
to
commence
the
insurrection
at
once
some
of
his
friends
on
the
other
hand
were
in
favor
of
abandoning
the
enterprise
and
flying
from
the
country
but
essex
said
he
had
rather
be
shot
at
the
head
of
his
bands
than
to
wander
all
his
days
beyond
the
seas
a
fugitive
and
a
vagabond
the
conspirators
acceded
to
their
leaders
councils
they
sent
word
accordingly
into
the
city
and
began
to
make
their
arrangements
to
rise
in
arms
the
next
morning
the
night
was
spent
in
anxious
preparations
early
in
the
morning
a
deputation
of
some
of
the
highest
officers
of
the
government
with
a
train
of
attendants
came
to
essexs
palace
and
demanded
entrance
in
the
name
of
the
queen
the
gates
of
the
palace
were
shut
and
guarded
at
last
after
some
hesitation
and
delay
the
conspirators
opened
a
wicket
that
is
a
small
gate
within
the
large
one
which
would
admit
one
person
at
a
time
they
allowed
the
officers
themselves
to
enter
but
shut
the
gate
immediately
so
as
to
exclude
the
attendants
the
officers
found
themselves
in
a
large
courtyard
filled
with
armed
men
essex
standing
calmly
at
the
head
of
them
they
demanded
what
was
the
meaning
of
such
an
unusual
assemblage
essex
replied
that
it
was
to
defend
his
life
from
conspiracies
formed
against
it
by
his
enemies
the
officers
denied
this
danger
and
began
to
expostulate
with
essex
in
angry
terms
and
the
attendants
on
his
side
to
reply
with
vociferations
and
threats
when
essex
to
end
the
altercation
took
the
officers
into
the
palace
he
conducted
them
to
a
room
and
shut
them
up
to
keep
them
as
hostages
it
was
now
near
ten
oclock
and
leaving
his
prisoners
in
their
apartment
under
a
proper
guard
essex
sallied
forth
with
the
more
resolute
and
desperate
of
his
followers
and
proceeded
into
the
city
to
bring
out
into
action
the
forces
which
he
supposed
were
ready
to
cooperate
with
him
there
he
rode
on
through
the
streets
calling
to
arms
and
shouting
for
the
queen
for
the
queen
his
design
was
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
movement
which
he
was
making
was
not
against
the
queen
herself
but
against
his
own
enemies
in
her
councils
and
that
she
was
herself
on
his
side
the
people
of
london
however
could
not
be
so
easily
deceived
the
mayor
had
received
warning
before
from
the
council
to
be
ready
to
suppress
the
movement
if
one
should
be
made
as
soon
therefore
as
essex
and
his
company
were
fairly
in
the
city
the
gates
were
shut
and
barred
to
prevent
his
return
one
of
the
queens
principal
ministers
of
state
too
at
the
head
of
a
small
troop
of
horsemen
came
in
and
rode
through
the
streets
proclaiming
essex
a
traitor
and
calling
upon
all
the
citizens
to
aid
in
arresting
him
one
of
essexs
followers
fired
a
pistol
at
this
officer
to
stop
his
proclamation
but
the
people
generally
seemed
disposed
to
listen
to
him
and
to
comply
with
his
demand
after
riding
therefore
through
some
of
the
principal
streets
he
returned
to
the
queen
and
reported
to
her
that
all
was
well
in
the
city
there
was
no
danger
that
essex
would
succeed
in
raising
a
rebellion
there
in
the
mean
time
the
further
essex
proceeded
the
more
he
found
himself
environed
with
difficulties
and
dangers
the
people
began
to
assemble
here
and
there
with
evident
intent
to
impede
his
movements
they
blocked
up
the
streets
with
carts
and
coaches
to
prevent
his
escape
his
followers
one
after
another
finding
all
hope
of
success
gone
abandoned
their
despairing
leader
and
fled
essex
himself
with
the
few
who
still
adhered
to
him
wandered
about
till
two
oclock
finding
the
way
of
retreat
every
where
hemmed
up
against
him
at
length
he
fled
to
the
river
side
took
a
boat
with
the
few
who
still
remained
with
him
and
ordered
the
watermen
to
row
as
rapidly
as
possible
up
the
river
they
landed
at
westminster
retreated
to
essexs
house
fled
into
it
with
the
utmost
precipitation
and
barricaded
the
doors
essex
himself
was
excited
in
the
highest
degree
fully
determined
to
die
there
rather
than
surrender
himself
a
prisoner
the
terrible
desperation
to
which
men
are
reduced
in
emergencies
like
these
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
one
of
his
followers
did
actually
station
himself
at
a
window
bareheaded
inviting
a
shot
from
the
pistols
of
the
pursuers
who
had
by
this
time
environed
the
house
and
were
preparing
to
force
their
way
in
his
plan
succeeded
he
was
shot
and
died
that
night
essex
himself
was
not
quite
so
desperate
as
this
he
soon
saw
however
that
he
must
sooner
or
later
yield
he
could
not
stand
a
siege
in
his
own
private
dwelling
against
the
whole
force
of
the
english
realm
he
surrendered
about
six
in
the
evening
and
was
sent
to
the
tower
he
was
soon
afterward
brought
to
trial
the
facts
with
all
the
arrangements
and
details
of
the
conspiracy
were
fully
proved
and
he
was
condemned
to
die
as
the
unhappy
prisoner
lay
in
his
gloomy
dungeon
in
the
tower
the
insane
excitement
under
which
he
had
for
so
many
months
been
acting
slowly
ebbed
away
he
awoke
from
it
gradually
as
one
recovers
his
senses
after
a
dreadful
dream
he
saw
how
utterly
irretrievable
was
the
mischief
which
had
been
done
remorse
for
his
guilt
in
having
attempted
to
destroy
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
to
gratify
his
own
personal
feelings
of
revenge
recollections
of
the
favors
which
elizabeth
had
shown
him
and
of
the
love
which
she
had
felt
for
him
obviously
so
deep
and
sincere
the
consciousness
that
his
life
was
fairly
forfeited
and
that
he
must
dieto
lie
in
his
cell
and
think
of
these
things
overwhelmed
him
with
anguish
and
despair
the
brilliant
prospects
which
were
so
recently
before
him
were
all
forever
gone
leaving
nothing
in
their
place
but
the
grim
phantom
of
an
executioner
standing
with
an
ax
by
the
side
of
a
dreadful
platform
with
a
block
upon
it
half
revealed
and
half
hidden
by
the
black
cloth
which
covered
it
like
a
pall
elizabeth
in
her
palace
was
in
a
state
of
mind
scarcely
less
distressing
than
that
of
the
wretched
prisoner
in
his
cell
the
old
conflict
was
renewedpride
and
resentment
on
the
one
side
and
love
which
would
not
be
extinguished
on
the
other
if
essex
would
sue
for
pardon
she
would
remit
his
sentence
and
allow
him
to
live
why
would
he
not
do
it
if
he
would
send
her
the
ring
which
she
had
given
him
for
exactly
such
an
emergency
he
might
be
saved
why
did
he
not
send
it
the
courtiers
and
statesmen
about
her
urged
her
to
sign
the
warrant
the
peace
of
the
country
demanded
the
execution
of
the
laws
in
a
case
of
such
unquestionable
guilt
they
told
her
too
that
essex
wished
to
die
that
he
knew
that
he
was
hopelessly
and
irretrievably
ruined
and
that
life
if
granted
to
him
was
a
boon
which
would
compromise
her
own
safety
and
confer
no
benefit
on
him
still
elizabeth
waited
and
waited
in
an
agony
of
suspense
in
hopes
that
the
ring
would
come
the
sending
of
it
would
be
so
far
an
act
of
submission
on
his
part
as
would
put
it
in
her
power
to
do
the
rest
her
love
could
bend
her
pride
indomitable
as
it
usually
was
almost
to
the
whole
concession
but
it
would
not
give
up
quite
all
it
demanded
some
sacrifice
on
his
part
which
sacrifice
the
sending
of
the
ring
would
have
rendered
the
ring
did
not
come
nor
any
petition
for
mercy
and
at
length
the
fatal
warrant
was
signed
what
the
courtiers
said
about
essexs
desire
to
die
was
doubtless
true
like
every
other
person
involved
in
irretrievable
sufferings
and
sorrows
he
wanted
to
live
and
he
wanted
to
die
the
two
contradictory
desires
shared
dominion
in
his
heart
sometimes
struggling
together
in
a
tumultuous
conflict
and
sometimes
reigning
in
alternation
in
calms
more
terrible
in
fact
than
the
tempests
which
preceded
and
followed
them
at
the
appointed
time
the
unhappy
man
was
led
out
to
the
courtyard
in
the
tower
where
the
last
scene
was
to
be
enacted
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
presided
dressed
in
a
black
velvet
gown
over
a
suit
of
black
satin
the
scaffold
was
a
platform
about
twelve
feet
square
and
four
feet
high
with
a
railing
around
it
and
steps
by
which
to
ascend
the
block
was
in
the
center
of
it
covered
as
well
as
the
platform
itself
with
black
cloth
there
were
seats
erected
near
for
those
who
were
appointed
to
be
present
at
the
execution
essex
ascended
the
platform
with
a
firm
step
and
surveying
the
solemn
scene
around
him
with
calmness
and
composure
he
began
to
speak
he
asked
the
forgiveness
of
god
of
the
spectators
present
and
of
the
queen
for
the
crimes
for
which
he
was
about
to
suffer
he
acknowledged
his
guilt
and
the
justice
of
his
condemnation
his
mind
seemed
deeply
imbued
with
a
sense
of
his
accountability
to
god
and
he
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
be
forgiven
for
christs
sake
for
all
the
sins
which
he
had
committed
which
had
been
he
said
most
numerous
and
aggravated
from
his
earliest
years
he
asked
the
spectators
present
to
join
him
in
his
devotions
and
he
then
proceeded
to
offer
a
short
prayer
in
which
he
implored
pardon
for
his
sins
and
a
long
life
and
happy
reign
for
the
queen
the
prayer
ended
all
was
ready
the
executioner
according
to
the
strange
custom
on
such
occasions
then
asked
his
pardon
for
the
violence
which
he
was
about
to
commit
which
essex
readily
granted
essex
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
and
it
required
three
blows
to
complete
its
severance
from
the
body
when
the
deed
was
done
the
executioner
took
up
the
bleeding
head
saying
solemnly
as
he
held
it
god
save
the
queen
there
were
but
few
spectators
present
at
this
dreadful
scene
and
they
were
chiefly
persons
required
to
attend
in
the
discharge
of
their
official
duties
there
was
however
one
exception
it
was
that
of
a
courtier
of
high
rank
who
had
long
been
essexs
inveterate
enemy
and
who
could
not
deny
himself
the
savage
pleasure
of
witnessing
his
rivals
destruction
but
even
the
stern
and
ironhearted
officers
of
the
tower
were
shocked
at
his
appearing
at
the
scaffold
they
urged
him
to
go
away
and
not
distress
the
dying
man
by
his
presence
at
such
an
hour
the
courtier
yielded
so
far
as
to
withdraw
from
the
scaffold
but
he
could
not
go
far
away
he
found
a
place
where
he
could
stand
unobserved
to
witness
the
scene
at
the
window
of
a
turret
which
overlooked
the
courtyard

there
can
be
no
doubt
that
essex
was
really
guilty
of
the
treason
for
which
he
was
condemned
but
mankind
have
generally
been
inclined
to
consider
elizabeth
rather
than
him
as
the
one
really
accountable
both
for
the
crime
and
its
consequences
to
elate
and
intoxicate
in
the
first
place
an
ardent
and
ambitious
boy
by
flattery
and
favors
and
then
in
the
end
on
the
occurrence
of
real
or
fancied
causes
of
displeasure
to
tease
and
torment
so
sensitive
and
impetuous
a
spirit
to
absolute
madness
and
phrensy
was
to
take
the
responsibility
in
a
great
measure
for
all
the
effects
which
might
follow
at
least
so
it
has
generally
been
regarded
by
almost
all
the
readers
of
the
story
essex
is
pitied
and
mournedit
is
elizabeth
that
is
condemned
it
is
a
melancholy
story
but
scenes
exactly
parallel
to
this
case
are
continually
occurring
in
private
life
all
around
us
where
sorrows
and
sufferings
which
are
so
far
as
the
heart
is
concerned
precisely
the
same
result
from
the
combined
action
or
rather
perhaps
the
alternating
and
contending
action
of
fondness
passion
and
obstinacy
the
results
are
always
in
their
own
nature
the
same
though
not
often
on
so
great
a
scale
as
to
make
the
wrong
which
follows
treason
against
a
realm
and
the
consequences
a
beheading
in
the
tower
there
must
have
been
some
vague
consciousness
of
this
her
share
in
the
guilt
of
the
transaction
in
elizabeths
mind
even
while
the
trial
of
essex
was
going
on
we
know
that
she
was
harassed
by
the
most
tormenting
suspense
and
perplexity
while
the
question
of
the
execution
of
his
sentence
was
pending
of
course
when
the
plot
was
discovered
essexs
party
and
all
his
friends
fell
immediately
from
all
influence
and
consideration
at
court
many
of
them
were
arrested
and
imprisoned
and
four
were
executed
as
he
had
been
the
party
which
had
been
opposed
to
him
acquired
at
once
the
entire
ascendency
and
they
all
judges
counselors
statesmen
and
generals
combined
their
influence
to
press
upon
the
queen
the
necessity
of
his
execution
she
signed
one
warrant
and
delivered
it
to
the
officer
but
then
as
soon
as
the
deed
was
done
she
was
so
overwhelmed
with
distress
and
anguish
that
she
sent
to
recall
it
and
had
it
canceled
finally
she
signed
another
and
the
sentence
was
executed
time
will
cure
in
our
earlier
years
most
of
the
sufferings
and
calm
most
of
the
agitations
of
the
soul
however
incurable
and
uncontrollable
they
may
at
first
appear
to
the
sufferer
but
in
the
later
periods
of
life
when
severe
shocks
strike
very
heavily
upon
the
soul
there
is
found
far
less
of
buoyancy
and
recovering
power
to
meet
the
blow
in
such
cases
the
stunned
and
bewildered
spirit
moves
on
after
receiving
its
wound
staggering
as
it
were
with
faintness
and
pain
and
leaving
it
for
a
long
time
uncertain
whether
it
will
ultimately
rise
and
recover
or
sink
down
and
die
dreadfully
wounded
as
elizabeth
was
in
all
the
inmost
feelings
and
affections
of
her
heart
by
the
execution
of
her
beloved
favorite
she
was
a
woman
of
far
too
much
spirit
and
energy
to
yield
without
a
struggle
she
made
the
greatest
efforts
possible
after
his
death
to
banish
the
subject
from
her
mind
and
to
recover
her
wonted
spirits
she
went
on
hunting
excursions
and
parties
of
pleasure
she
prosecuted
with
great
energy
her
war
with
the
spaniards
and
tried
to
interest
herself
in
the
siege
and
defense
of
continental
cities
she
received
an
embassage
from
the
court
of
france
with
great
pomp
and
parade
and
made
a
grand
progress
through
a
part
of
her
dominions
with
a
long
train
of
attendants
to
the
house
of
a
nobleman
where
she
entertained
the
embassador
many
days
in
magnificent
state
at
her
own
expense
with
plate
and
furniture
brought
from
her
own
palaces
for
the
purpose
she
even
planned
an
interview
between
herself
and
the
king
of
france
and
went
to
dover
to
effect
it
but
all
would
not
do
nothing
could
drive
the
thoughts
of
essex
from
her
mind
or
dispel
the
dejection
with
which
the
recollection
of
her
love
for
him
and
of
his
unhappy
fate
oppressed
her
spirit
a
year
or
two
passed
away
but
time
brought
no
relief
sometimes
she
was
fretful
and
peevish
and
sometimes
hopelessly
dejected
and
sad
she
told
the
french
embassador
one
day
that
she
was
weary
of
her
life
and
when
she
attempted
to
speak
of
essex
as
the
cause
of
her
grief
she
sighed
bitterly
and
burst
into
tears
when
she
recovered
her
composure
she
told
the
embassador
that
she
had
always
been
uneasy
about
essex
while
he
lived
and
knowing
his
impetuosity
of
spirit
and
his
ambition
she
had
been
afraid
that
he
would
one
day
attempt
something
which
would
compromise
his
life
and
she
had
warned
and
entreated
him
not
to
be
led
into
any
such
designs
for
if
he
did
so
his
fate
would
have
to
be
decided
by
the
stern
authority
of
law
and
not
by
her
own
indulgent
feelings
but
that
all
her
earnest
warnings
had
been
insufficient
to
save
him
it
was
the
same
whenever
any
thing
occurred
which
recalled
thoughts
of
essex
to
her
mind
it
almost
always
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
when
essex
was
commanding
in
ireland
it
will
be
recollected
that
he
had
on
one
occasion
come
to
a
parley
with
tyrone
the
rebel
leader
across
the
current
of
a
stream
an
officer
in
his
army
named
harrington
had
been
with
him
on
this
occasion
and
present
though
at
a
little
distance
during
the
interview
after
essex
had
left
ireland
another
lorddeputy
had
been
appointed
but
the
rebellion
continued
to
give
the
government
a
great
deal
of
trouble
the
spaniards
came
over
to
tyrones
assistance
and
elizabeths
mind
was
much
occupied
with
plans
for
subduing
him
one
day
harrington
was
at
court
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
and
she
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
seen
tyrone
harrington
replied
that
he
had
the
queen
then
recollected
the
former
interview
which
harrington
had
had
with
him
and
she
said
oh
now
i
recollect
that
you
have
seen
him
before
this
thought
recalled
essex
so
forcibly
to
her
mind
and
filled
her
with
such
painful
emotions
that
she
looked
up
to
harrington
with
a
countenance
full
of
grief
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
she
beat
her
breast
with
every
indication
of
extreme
mental
suffering
things
went
on
in
this
way
until
toward
the
close
of
when
an
incident
occurred
which
seemed
to
strike
down
at
once
and
forever
what
little
strength
and
spirit
the
queen
had
remaining
the
countess
of
nottingham
a
celebrated
lady
of
the
court
was
dangerously
sick
and
had
sent
for
the
queen
to
come
and
see
her
saying
that
she
had
a
communication
to
make
to
her
majesty
herself
personally
which
she
was
very
anxious
to
make
to
her
before
she
died
the
queen
went
accordingly
to
see
her
when
she
arrived
at
the
bedside
the
countess
showed
her
a
ring
elizabeth
immediately
recognized
it
as
the
ring
which
she
had
given
to
essex
and
which
she
had
promised
to
consider
a
special
pledge
of
her
protection
and
which
was
to
be
sent
to
her
by
him
whenever
he
found
himself
in
any
extremity
of
danger
and
distress
the
queen
eagerly
demanded
where
it
came
from
the
countess
replied
that
essex
had
sent
the
ring
to
her
during
his
imprisonment
in
the
tower
and
after
his
condemnation
with
an
earnest
request
that
she
would
deliver
it
to
the
queen
as
the
token
of
her
promise
of
protection
and
of
his
own
supplication
for
mercy
the
countess
added
that
she
had
intended
to
deliver
the
ring
according
to
essexs
request
but
her
husband
who
was
the
unhappy
prisoners
enemy
forbade
her
to
do
it
that
ever
since
the
execution
of
essex
she
had
been
greatly
distressed
at
the
consequences
of
her
having
withheld
the
ring
and
that
now
as
she
was
about
to
leave
the
world
herself
she
felt
that
she
could
not
die
in
peace
without
first
seeing
the
queen
and
acknowledging
fully
what
she
had
done
and
imploring
her
forgiveness
the
queen
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
extreme
indignation
and
displeasure
by
this
statement
she
reproached
the
dying
countess
in
the
bitterest
terms
and
shook
her
as
she
lay
helpless
in
her
bed
saying
god
may
forgive
you
if
he
pleases
but
i
never
will
she
then
went
away
in
a
rage
her
exasperation
however
against
the
countess
was
soon
succeeded
by
bursts
of
inconsolable
grief
at
the
recollection
of
the
hopeless
and
irretrievable
loss
of
the
object
of
her
affection
whose
image
the
ring
called
back
so
forcibly
to
her
mind
her
imagination
wandered
in
wretchedness
and
despair
to
the
gloomy
dungeon
in
the
tower
where
essex
had
been
confined
and
painted
him
pining
there
day
after
day
in
dreadful
suspense
and
anxiety
waiting
for
her
to
redeem
the
solemn
pledge
by
which
she
had
bound
herself
in
giving
him
the
ring
all
the
sorrow
which
she
had
felt
at
his
untimely
and
cruel
fate
was
awakened
afresh
and
became
more
poignant
than
ever
she
made
them
place
cushions
for
her
upon
the
floor
in
the
most
inner
and
secluded
of
her
apartments
and
there
she
would
lie
all
the
day
long
her
hair
disheveled
her
dress
neglected
her
food
refused
and
her
mind
a
prey
to
almost
uninterrupted
anguish
and
grief
in
january
she
felt
that
she
was
drawing
toward
her
end
and
she
decided
to
be
removed
from
westminster
to
richmond
because
there
was
there
an
arrangement
of
closets
communicating
with
her
chamber
in
which
she
could
easily
and
conveniently
attend
divine
service
she
felt
that
she
had
now
done
with
the
world
and
all
the
relief
and
comfort
which
she
could
find
at
all
from
the
pressure
of
her
distress
was
in
that
sense
of
protection
and
safety
which
she
experienced
when
in
the
presence
of
god
and
listening
to
the
exercises
of
devotion
illustration
elizabeth
in
her
last
hours
it
was
a
cold
and
stormy
day
in
january
when
she
went
to
richmond
but
being
restless
and
ill
at
ease
she
would
not
be
deterred
by
that
circumstance
from
making
the
journey
she
became
worse
after
this
removal
she
made
them
put
cushions
again
for
her
upon
the
floor
and
she
would
lie
upon
them
all
the
day
refusing
to
go
to
her
bed
there
was
a
communication
from
her
chamber
to
closets
connected
with
a
chapel
where
she
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
and
hear
divine
service
these
closets
were
of
the
form
of
small
galleries
where
the
queen
and
her
immediate
attendants
could
sit
there
was
one
open
and
public
anothera
smaller
onewas
private
with
curtains
which
could
be
drawn
before
it
so
as
to
screen
those
within
from
the
notice
of
the
congregation
the
queen
intended
first
to
go
into
the
great
closet
but
feeling
too
weak
for
this
she
changed
her
mind
and
ordered
the
private
one
to
be
prepared
at
last
she
decided
not
to
attempt
to
make
even
this
effort
but
ordered
the
cushions
to
be
put
down
upon
the
floor
near
the
entrance
in
her
own
room
and
she
lay
there
while
the
prayers
were
read
listening
to
the
voice
of
the
clergyman
as
it
came
in
to
her
through
the
open
door
one
day
she
asked
them
to
take
off
the
wedding
ring
with
which
she
had
commemorated
her
espousal
to
her
kingdom
and
her
people
on
the
day
of
her
coronation
the
flesh
had
swollen
around
it
so
that
it
could
not
be
removed
the
attendants
procured
an
instrument
and
cut
it
in
two
and
so
relieved
the
finger
from
the
pressure
the
work
was
done
in
silence
and
solemnity
the
queen
herself
as
well
as
the
attendants
regarding
it
as
a
symbol
that
the
union
of
which
the
ring
had
been
the
pledge
was
about
to
be
sundered
forever
she
sunk
rapidly
day
by
day
and
as
it
became
more
and
more
probable
that
she
would
soon
cease
to
live
the
nobles
and
statesmen
who
had
been
attendants
at
her
court
for
so
many
years
withdrew
one
after
another
from
the
palace
and
left
london
secretly
but
with
eager
dispatch
to
make
their
way
to
scotland
in
order
to
be
the
first
to
hail
king
james
the
moment
they
should
learn
that
elizabeth
had
ceased
to
breathe
her
being
abandoned
thus
by
these
heartless
friends
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
dying
queen
though
her
strength
of
body
was
almost
gone
the
soul
was
as
active
and
busy
as
ever
within
its
failing
tenement
she
watched
every
thingnoticed
every
thing
growing
more
and
more
jealous
and
irritable
just
in
proportion
as
her
situation
became
helpless
and
forlorn
every
thing
seemed
to
conspire
to
deepen
the
despondency
and
gloom
which
darkened
her
dying
hours
her
strength
rapidly
declined
her
voice
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
on
the
d
of
march
she
could
no
longer
speak
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
she
aroused
herself
a
little
and
contrived
to
make
signs
to
have
her
council
called
to
her
bedside
those
who
had
not
gone
to
scotland
came
they
asked
her
whom
she
wished
to
have
succeed
her
on
the
throne
she
could
not
answer
but
when
they
named
king
james
of
scotland
she
made
a
sign
of
assent
after
a
time
the
counselors
went
away
at
six
oclock
in
the
evening
she
made
signs
for
the
archbishop
and
her
chaplains
to
come
to
her
they
were
sent
for
and
came
when
they
came
in
they
approached
her
bedside
and
kneeled
the
patient
was
lying
upon
her
back
speechless
but
her
eye
still
moving
watchfully
and
observing
every
thing
showed
that
the
faculties
of
the
soul
were
unimpaired
one
of
the
clergymen
asked
her
questions
respecting
her
faith
of
course
she
could
not
answer
in
words
she
made
signs
however
with
her
eyes
and
her
hands
which
seemed
to
prove
that
she
had
full
possession
of
all
her
faculties
the
bystanders
looked
on
with
breathless
attention
the
aged
bishop
who
had
asked
the
questions
then
began
to
pray
for
her
he
continued
his
prayer
a
long
time
and
then
pronouncing
a
benediction
upon
her
he
was
about
to
rise
but
she
made
a
sign
the
bishop
did
not
understand
what
she
meant
but
a
lady
present
said
that
she
wished
the
bishop
to
continue
his
devotions
the
bishop
though
weary
with
kneeling
continued
his
prayer
half
an
hour
longer
he
then
closed
again
but
she
repeated
the
sign
the
bishop
finding
thus
that
his
ministrations
gave
her
so
much
comfort
renewed
them
with
greater
fervency
than
before
and
continued
his
supplications
for
a
long
timeso
long
that
those
who
had
been
present
at
the
commencement
of
the
service
went
away
softly
one
after
another
so
that
when
at
last
the
bishop
retired
the
queen
was
left
with
her
nurses
and
her
women
alone
these
attendants
remained
at
their
dying
sovereigns
bedside
for
a
few
hours
longer
watching
the
failing
pulse
the
quickened
breathing
and
all
the
other
indications
of
approaching
dissolution
as
hour
after
hour
thus
passed
on
they
wished
that
their
weary
task
was
done
and
that
both
their
patient
and
themselves
were
at
rest
this
lasted
till
midnight
and
then
the
intelligence
was
communicated
about
the
palace
that
elizabeth
was
no
more
in
the
mean
time
all
the
roads
to
scotland
were
covered
as
it
were
with
eager
aspirants
for
the
favor
of
the
distinguished
personage
there
who
from
the
instant
elizabeth
ceased
to
breathe
became
king
of
england
they
flocked
into
scotland
by
sea
and
by
land
urging
their
way
as
rapidly
as
possible
each
eager
to
be
foremost
in
paying
his
homage
to
the
rising
sun
the
council
assembled
and
proclaimed
king
james
elizabeth
lay
neglected
and
forgotten
the
interest
she
had
inspired
was
awakened
only
by
her
power
and
that
being
gone
nobody
mourned
for
her
or
lamented
her
death
the
attention
of
the
kingdom
was
soon
universally
absorbed
in
the
plans
for
receiving
and
proclaiming
the
new
monarch
from
the
north

in
anticipations
of
the
splendid
pageantry

mounts
still
further
carrying
the
consecration

the
spot

to
the
christian
era

telling
us
that

it
will
be
recollected
that
james
who
now
succeeded
elizabeth
was
the
son
of
mary
queen
of
scots
soon
after
his
accession
to
the
throne
he
removed
the
remains
of
his
mother
from
their
place

sepulture

interred
them
in

south
aisle
of
henry

sevenths
chapel
while
the
body
of
elizabeth
occupied
the
northern
onee
he
placed
also
over
marys
remains
a
tomb
very
similar
in
its
plan
and
design
to
that
by
which
the
memory
of
elizabeth
was
honored
and
there
the
rival
queens
have
since
reposed
in
silence
and
peace
under
the
same
paved
floor
and
though
the
monuments
do
not
materially
differ
in
their
architectural
forms
it
is
found
that

they
who

on

this
quaint
old
french
verse
written
under
one
of
holbein
s
pictures
is
profoundly
melancholy
the
engraving
represents
a
laborer
driving
his
plow
through
the
middle
of
a
field
beyond
him
stretches
a
vast
horizon
dotted
with
wretched
huts
the
sun
is
sinking
behind
the
hill
it
is
the
end
of
a
hard
day
s
work
the
peasant
is
old
bent
and
clothed
in
rags
he
is
urging
onward
a
team
of
four
thin
and
exhausted
horses
the
plowshare
sinks
into
a
stony
and
ungrateful
soil
one
being
only
is
active
and
alert
in
this
scene
of
toil
and
sorrow
it
is
a
fantastic
creature
a
skeleton
armed
with
a
whip
who
acts
as
plowboy
to
the
old
laborer
and
running
along
through
the
furrow
beside
the
terrified
horses
goads
them
on
this
is
the
specter
death
whom
holbein
has
introduced
allegorically
into
that
series
of
religious
and
philosophic
subjects
at
once
melancholy
and
grotesque
entitled
the
dance
of
death
in
this
collection
or
rather
this
mighty
composition
where
death
who
plays
his
part
on
every
page
is
the
connecting
link
and
predominating
thought
holbein
has
called
up
kings
popes
lovers
gamesters
drunkards
nuns
courtesans
thieves
warriors
monks
jews
and
travelersall
the
people
of
his
time
and
our
own
and
everywhere
the
specter
death
is
among
them
taunting
threatening
and
triumphing
he
is
absent
from
one
picture
only
where
lazarus
lying
on
a
dunghill
at
the
rich
man
s
door
declares
that
the
specter
has
no
terrors
for
him
probably
because
he
has
nothing
to
lose
and
his
existence
is
already
a
life
in
death
is
there
comfort
in
this
stoical
thought
of
the
halfpagan
christianity
of
the
renaissance
and
does
it
satisfy
religious
souls
the
upstart
the
rogue
the
tyrant
the
rake
and
all
those
haughty
sinners
who
make
an
ill
use
of
life
and
whose
steps
are
dogged
by
death
will
be
surely
punished
but
can
the
reflection
that
death
is
no
evil
make
amends
for
the
long
hardships
of
the
blind
man
the
beggar
the
madman
and
the
poor
peasant
no
an
inexorable
sadness
an
appalling
fatality
brood
over
the
artist
s
work
it
is
like
a
bitter
curse
hurled
against
the
fate
of
humanity
holbein
s
faithful
delineation
of
the
society
in
which
he
lived
is
indeed
painful
satire
his
attention
was
engrossed
by
crime
and
calamity
but
what
shall
we
who
are
artists
of
a
later
date
portray
shall
we
look
to
find
the
reward
of
the
human
beings
of
today
in
the
contemplation
of
death
and
shall
we
invoke
it
as
the
penalty
of
unrighteousness
and
the
compensation
of
suffering
no
henceforth
our
business
is
not
with
death
but
with
life
we
believe
no
longer
in
the
nothingness
of
the
grave
nor
in
safety
bought
with
the
price
of
a
forced
renunciation
life
must
be
enjoyed
in
order
to
be
fruitful
lazarus
must
leave
his
dunghill
so
that
the
poor
need
no
longer
exult
in
the
death
of
the
rich
all
must
be
made
happy
that
the
good
fortune
of
a
few
may
not
be
a
crime
and
a
curse
as
the
laborer
sows
his
wheat
he
must
know
that
he
is
helping
forward
the
work
of
life
instead
of
rejoicing
that
death
walks
at
his
side
we
may
no
longer
consider
death
as
the
chastisement
of
prosperity
or
the
consolation
of
distress
for
god
has
decreed
it
neither
as
the
punishment
nor
the
compensation
of
life
life
has
been
blessed
by
him
and
it
is
no
longer
permissible
for
us
to
leave
the
grave
as
the
only
refuge
for
those
whom
we
are
unwilling
to
make
happy
there
are
some
artists
of
our
own
day
who
after
a
serious
survey
of
their
surroundings
take
pleasure
in
painting
misery
the
sordidness
of
poverty
and
the
dunghill
of
lazarus
this
may
belong
to
the
domain
of
art
and
philosophy
but
by
depicting
poverty
as
so
hideous
so
degraded
and
sometimes
so
vicious
and
criminal
do
they
gain
their
end
and
is
that
end
as
salutary
as
they
would
wish
we
dare
not
pronounce
judgment
they
may
answer
that
they
terrify
the
unjust
rich
man
by
pointing
out
to
him
the
yawning
pit
that
lies
beneath
the
frail
covering
of
wealth
just
as
in
the
time
of
the
dance
of
death
they
showed
him
his
gaping
grave
and
death
standing
ready
to
fold
him
in
an
impure
embrace
now
they
show
him
the
thief
breaking
open
his
doors
and
the
murderer
stealthily
watching
his
sleep
we
confess
we
cannot
understand
how
we
can
reconcile
him
to
the
human
nature
he
despises
or
make
him
sensible
of
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
wretch
whom
he
dreads
by
showing
him
this
wretch
in
the
guise
of
the
escaped
convict
or
the
nocturnal
burglar
the
hideous
phantom
death
under
the
repulsive
aspect
in
which
he
has
been
represented
by
holbein
and
his
predecessors
gnashing
his
teeth
and
playing
the
fiddle
has
been
powerless
to
convert
the
wicked
and
console
their
victims
and
does
not
our
literature
employ
the
same
means
as
the
artists
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance
the
revelers
of
holbein
fill
their
glasses
in
a
frenzy
to
dispel
the
idea
of
death
who
is
their
cupbearer
though
they
do
not
see
him
the
unjust
rich
of
our
own
day
demand
cannon
and
barricades
to
drive
out
the
idea
of
an
insurrection
of
the
people
which
art
shows
them
as
slowly
working
in
the
dark
getting
ready
to
burst
upon
the
state
the
church
of
the
middle
ages
met
the
terrors
of
the
great
of
the
earth
with
the
sale
of
indulgences
the
government
of
today
soothes
the
uneasiness
of
the
rich
by
exacting
from
them
large
sums
for
the
support
of
policemen
jailors
bayonets
and
prisons
albert
durer
michael
angelo
holbein
callot
and
goya
have
made
powerful
satires
on
the
evils
of
their
times
and
countries
and
their
immortal
works
are
historical
documents
of
unquestionable
value
we
shall
not
refuse
to
artists
the
right
to
probe
the
wounds
of
society
and
lay
them
bare
to
our
eyes
but
is
the
only
function
of
art
still
to
threaten
and
appall
in
the
literature
of
the
mysteries
of
iniquity
which
talent
and
imagination
have
brought
into
fashion
we
prefer
the
sweet
and
gentle
characters
which
can
attempt
and
effect
conversions
to
the
melodramatic
villains
who
inspire
terror
for
terror
never
cures
selfishness
but
increases
it
we
believe
that
the
mission
of
art
is
a
mission
of
sentiment
and
love
that
the
novel
of
today
should
take
the
place
of
the
parable
and
the
fable
of
early
times
and
that
the
artist
has
a
larger
and
more
poetic
task
than
that
of
suggesting
certain
prudential
and
conciliatory
measures
for
the
purpose
of
diminishing
the
fright
caused
by
his
pictures
his
aim
should
be
to
render
attractive
the
objects
he
has
at
heart
and
if
necessary
i
have
no
objection
to
his
embellishing
them
a
little
art
is
not
the
study
of
positive
reality
but
the
search
for
ideal
truth
and
the
vicar
of
wakefield
was
a
more
useful
and
healthy
book
than
the
paysan
perverti
or
the
liaisons
dangereuses
forgive
these
reflections
of
mine
kind
reader
and
let
them
stand
as
a
preface
for
there
will
be
no
other
to
the
little
story
i
am
going
to
relate
to
you
my
tale
is
to
be
so
short
and
so
simple
that
i
felt
obliged
to
make
you
my
apologies
for
it
beforehand
by
telling
you
what
i
think
of
the
literature
of
terror
i
have
allowed
myself
to
be
drawn
into
this
digression
for
the
sake
of
a
laborer
and
it
is
the
story
of
a
laborer
which
i
have
been
meaning
to
tell
you
and
which
i
shall
now
tell
you
at
once
in
toil
and
sorrow
thou
shalt
eat
the
bitter
bread
of
poverty
after
the
burden
and
the
heat
lo
it
is
death
who
calls
for
thee
illustration
ornament
i
the
tillage
of
the
soil
i
had
just
been
looking
long
and
sadly
at
holbein
s
plowman
and
was
walking
through
the
fields
musing
on
rustic
life
and
the
destiny
of
the
husbandman
it
is
certainly
tragic
for
him
to
spend
his
days
and
his
strength
delving
in
the
jealous
earth
that
so
reluctantly
yields
up
her
rich
treasures
when
a
morsel
of
coarse
black
bread
at
the
end
of
the
day
s
work
is
the
sole
reward
and
profit
to
be
reaped
from
such
arduous
toil
the
wealth
of
the
soil
the
harvests
the
fruits
the
splendid
cattle
that
grow
sleek
and
fat
in
the
luxuriant
grass
are
the
property
of
the
few
and
but
instruments
of
the
drudgery
and
slavery
of
the
many
the
man
of
leisure
seldom
loves
for
their
own
sake
the
fields
and
meadows
the
landscape
or
the
noble
animals
which
are
to
be
converted
into
gold
for
his
use
he
comes
to
the
country
for
his
health
or
for
change
of
air
but
goes
back
to
town
to
spend
the
fruit
of
his
vassal
s
labor
on
the
other
hand
the
peasant
is
too
abject
too
wretched
and
too
fearful
of
the
future
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
country
and
the
charms
of
pastoral
life
to
him
also
the
yellow
harvestfields
the
rich
meadows
the
fine
cattle
represent
bags
of
gold
but
he
knows
that
only
an
infinitesimal
part
of
their
contents
insufficient
for
his
daily
needs
will
ever
fall
to
his
share
yet
year
by
year
he
must
fill
those
accursed
bags
to
please
his
master
and
buy
the
right
of
living
on
his
land
in
sordid
wretchedness
yet
nature
is
eternally
young
beautiful
and
generous
she
pours
forth
poetry
and
beauty
on
all
creatures
and
all
plants
that
are
allowed
free
development
she
owns
the
secret
of
happiness
of
which
no
one
has
ever
robbed
her
the
happiest
of
men
would
be
he
who
knowing
the
full
meaning
of
his
labor
should
while
working
with
his
hands
find
his
happiness
and
his
freedom
in
the
exercise
of
his
intelligence
and
having
his
heart
in
unison
with
his
brain
should
at
once
understand
his
own
work
and
love
that
of
god
the
artist
has
such
delights
as
these
in
contemplating
and
reproducing
the
beauties
of
nature
but
if
his
heart
be
true
and
tender
his
pleasure
is
disturbed
when
he
sees
the
miseries
of
the
men
who
people
this
paradise
of
earth
true
happiness
will
be
theirs
when
mind
heart
and
hand
shall
work
in
concert
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
there
shall
be
a
sacred
harmony
between
god
s
goodness
and
the
joys
of
his
creatures
then
instead
of
the
pitiable
and
frightful
figure
of
death
stalking
whip
in
hand
across
the
fields
the
painter
of
allegories
may
place
beside
the
peasant
a
radiant
angel
sowing
the
blessed
grain
broadcast
in
the
smoking
furrow
the
dream
of
a
serene
free
poetic
laborious
and
simple
life
for
the
tiller
of
the
soil
is
not
so
impossible
that
we
should
banish
it
as
a
chimera
the
sweet
sad
words
of
virgil
oh
happy
the
peasants
of
the
field
if
they
knew
their
own
blessings
is
a
regret
but
like
all
regrets
it
is
also
a
prophecy
the
day
will
come
when
the
laborer
too
may
be
an
artist
and
may
at
least
feel
what
is
beautiful
if
he
cannot
express
ita
matter
of
far
less
importance
do
not
we
know
that
this
mysterious
poetic
intuition
is
already
his
in
the
form
of
instinct
and
vague
reverie
among
those
peasants
who
possess
some
of
the
comforts
of
life
and
whose
moral
and
intellectual
development
is
not
entirely
stifled
by
extreme
wretchedness
pure
happiness
that
can
be
felt
and
appreciated
exists
in
the
elementary
stage
and
moreover
since
poets
have
already
raised
their
voices
out
of
the
lap
of
pain
and
of
weariness
why
should
we
say
that
the
labor
of
the
hands
excludes
the
working
of
the
soul
without
doubt
this
exclusion
is
the
common
result
of
excessive
toil
and
of
deep
misery
but
let
it
not
be
said
that
when
men
shall
work
moderately
and
usefully
there
will
be
nothing
but
bad
workers
and
bad
poets
the
man
who
draws
in
noble
joy
from
the
poetic
feeling
is
a
true
poet
though
he
has
never
written
a
verse
all
his
life
my
thoughts
had
flown
in
this
direction
without
my
perceiving
that
my
confidence
in
the
capacity
of
man
for
education
was
strengthened
by
external
influences
i
was
walking
along
the
edge
of
a
field
which
some
peasants
were
preparing
to
sow
the
space
was
vast
as
that
in
holbein
s
picture
the
landscape
too
was
vast
and
framed
in
a
great
sweep
of
green
slightly
reddened
by
the
approach
of
autumn
here
and
there
in
the
great
russet
field
slender
rivulets
of
water
left
in
the
furrows
by
the
late
rains
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
like
silver
threads
the
day
was
clear
and
mild
and
the
soil
freshly
cleft
by
the
plowshare
sent
up
a
light
steam
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
field
an
old
man
whose
broad
shoulders
and
stern
face
recalled
holbein
s
plowman
but
whose
clothes
carried
no
suggestion
of
poverty
was
gravely
driving
his
plow
of
antique
shape
drawn
by
two
placid
oxen
true
patriarchs
of
the
meadow
tall
and
rather
thin
with
pale
yellow
coats
and
long
drooping
horns
they
were
those
old
workers
who
through
long
habit
have
grown
to
be
brothers
as
they
are
called
in
our
country
and
who
when
one
loses
the
other
refuse
to
work
with
a
new
comrade
and
pine
away
with
grief
people
who
are
unfamiliar
with
the
country
call
the
love
of
the
ox
for
his
yokefellow
a
fable
let
them
come
and
see
in
the
corner
of
the
stable
one
of
these
poor
beasts
thin
and
wasted
restlessly
lashing
his
lean
flanks
with
his
tail
violently
breathing
with
mingled
terror
and
disdain
on
the
food
offered
him
his
eyes
always
turned
toward
the
door
scratching
with
his
hoof
the
empty
place
at
his
side
sniffing
the
yokes
and
chains
which
his
fellow
used
to
wear
and
incessantly
calling
him
with
melancholy
lowings
the
oxherd
will
say
there
is
a
pair
of
oxen
gone
this
one
will
work
no
more
for
his
brother
is
dead
we
ought
to
fatten
him
for
the
market
but
he
will
not
eat
and
will
soon
starve
himself
to
death
the
old
laborer
worked
slowly
silently
and
without
waste
of
effort
his
docile
team
were
in
no
greater
haste
than
he
but
thanks
to
the
undistracted
steadiness
of
his
toil
and
the
judicious
expenditure
of
his
strength
his
furrow
was
as
soon
plowed
as
that
of
his
son
who
was
driving
at
some
distance
from
him
four
less
vigorous
oxen
through
a
more
stubborn
and
stony
piece
of
ground
my
attention
was
next
caught
by
a
fine
spectacle
a
truly
noble
subject
for
a
painter
at
the
other
end
of
the
field
a
finelooking
youth
was
driving
a
magnificent
team
of
four
pairs
of
young
oxen
through
whose
somber
coats
glanced
a
ruddy
glowlike
flame
they
had
the
short
curly
heads
that
belong
to
the
wild
bull
the
same
large
fierce
eyes
and
jerky
movements
they
worked
in
an
abrupt
nervous
way
that
showed
how
they
still
rebelled
against
the
yoke
and
goad
and
trembled
with
anger
as
they
obeyed
the
authority
so
recently
imposed
they
were
what
is
called
newly
yoked
oxen
the
man
who
drove
them
had
to
clear
a
corner
of
the
field
that
had
formerly
been
given
up
to
pasture
and
was
filled
with
old
treestumps
and
his
youth
and
energy
and
his
eight
halfbroken
animals
hardly
sufficed
for
the
herculean
task
a
child
of
six
or
seven
years
old
lovely
as
an
angel
wearing
round
his
shoulders
over
his
blouse
a
sheepskin
that
made
him
look
like
a
little
saint
john
the
baptist
out
of
a
renaissance
picture
was
running
along
in
the
furrow
beside
the
plow
pricking
the
flanks
of
the
oxen
with
a
long
light
goad
but
slightly
sharpened
the
spirited
animals
quivered
under
the
child
s
light
touch
making
their
yokes
and
headbands
creak
and
shaking
the
pole
violently
whenever
a
root
stopped
the
advance
of
the
plowshare
the
laborer
would
call
every
animal
by
name
in
his
powerful
voice
trying
to
calm
rather
than
to
excite
them
for
the
oxen
irritated
by
the
sudden
resistance
bounded
pawed
the
ground
with
their
great
cloven
hoofs
and
would
have
jumped
aside
and
dragged
the
plow
across
the
fields
if
the
young
man
had
not
kept
the
first
four
in
order
with
his
voice
and
goad
while
the
child
controlled
the
four
others
the
little
fellow
shouted
too
but
the
voice
which
he
tried
to
make
of
terrible
effect
was
as
sweet
as
his
angelic
face
the
whole
scene
was
beautiful
in
its
grace
and
strength
the
landscape
the
man
the
child
the
oxen
under
the
yoke
and
in
spite
of
the
mighty
struggle
by
which
the
earth
was
subdued
a
deep
feeling
of
peace
and
sweetness
reigned
over
all
each
time
that
an
obstacle
was
surmounted
and
the
plow
resumed
its
even
solemn
progress
the
laborer
whose
pretended
violence
was
but
a
trial
of
his
strength
and
an
outlet
for
his
energy
instantly
regained
that
serenity
which
is
the
right
of
simple
souls
and
looked
with
fatherly
pleasure
toward
his
child
who
turned
to
smile
back
at
him
then
the
young
father
would
raise
his
manly
voice
in
the
solemn
and
melancholy
chant
that
ancient
tradition
transmits
not
indeed
to
all
plowmen
indiscriminately
but
to
those
who
are
most
perfect
in
the
art
of
exciting
and
sustaining
the
spirit
of
cattle
while
at
work
this
song
which
was
probably
sacred
in
its
origin
and
to
which
mysterious
influences
must
once
have
been
attributed
is
still
thought
to
possess
the
virtue
of
putting
animals
on
their
mettle
allaying
their
irritation
and
of
beguiling
the
weariness
of
their
long
hard
toil
it
is
not
enough
to
guide
them
skilfully
to
trace
a
perfectly
straight
furrow
and
to
lighten
their
labor
by
raising
the
plowshare
or
driving
it
into
the
earth
no
man
can
be
a
consummate
husbandman
who
does
not
know
how
to
sing
to
his
oxen
and
that
is
an
art
that
requires
taste
and
especial
gifts
to
tell
the
truth
this
chant
is
only
a
recitative
broken
off
and
taken
up
at
pleasure
its
irregular
form
and
its
intonations
that
violate
all
the
rules
of
musical
art
make
it
impossible
to
describe
but
it
is
none
the
less
a
noble
song
and
so
appropriate
is
it
to
the
nature
of
the
work
it
accompanies
to
the
gait
of
the
oxen
to
the
peace
of
the
fields
and
to
the
simplicity
of
the
men
who
sing
it
that
no
genius
unfamiliar
with
the
tillage
of
the
earth
and
no
man
except
an
accomplished
laborer
of
our
part
of
the
country
could
repeat
it
at
the
season
of
the
year
when
there
is
no
work
or
stir
afoot
except
that
of
the
plowman
this
strong
sweet
refrain
rises
like
the
voice
of
the
breeze
to
which
the
key
it
is
sung
in
gives
it
some
resemblance
each
phrase
ends
with
a
long
trill
the
final
note
of
which
is
held
with
incredible
strength
of
breath
and
rises
a
quarter
of
a
tone
sharping
systematically
it
is
barbaric
but
possesses
an
unspeakable
charm
and
anybody
once
accustomed
to
hear
it
cannot
conceive
of
another
song
taking
its
place
at
the
same
hour
and
in
the
same
place
without
striking
a
discord
so
it
was
that
i
had
before
my
eyes
a
picture
the
reverse
of
that
of
holbein
although
the
scene
was
similar
instead
of
a
wretched
old
man
a
young
and
active
one
instead
of
a
team
of
weary
and
emaciated
horses
four
yoke
of
robust
and
fiery
oxen
instead
of
death
a
beautiful
child
instead
of
despair
and
destruction
energy
and
the
possibility
of
happiness
then
the
old
french
verse
à
la
sueur
de
ton
visaige
etc
and
virgil
s
o
fortunatos
agricolas
returned
to
my
mind
and
seeing
this
lovely
child
and
his
father
under
such
poetic
conditions
and
with
so
much
grace
and
strength
accomplish
a
task
full
of
such
grand
and
solemn
suggestions
i
was
conscious
of
deep
pity
and
involuntary
respect
happy
the
peasant
of
the
fields
yes
and
so
too
should
i
be
in
his
place
if
my
arm
and
voice
could
be
endowed
with
sudden
strength
and
i
could
help
to
make
nature
fruitful
and
sing
of
her
gifts
without
ceasing
to
see
with
my
eyes
or
understand
with
my
brain
harmonious
colors
and
sounds
delicate
shades
and
graceful
outlines
in
short
the
mysterious
beauty
of
all
things
and
above
all
if
my
heart
continued
to
beat
in
concert
with
the
divine
sentiment
that
presided
over
the
immortal
sublimity
of
creation
but
alas
this
man
has
never
understood
the
mystery
of
beauty
this
child
will
never
understand
it
god
forbid
that
i
should
not
think
them
superior
to
the
animals
which
are
subject
to
them
or
that
they
have
not
moments
of
rapturous
insight
that
soothe
their
toil
and
lull
their
cares
to
sleep
i
see
the
seal
of
the
lord
upon
their
noble
brows
for
they
were
born
to
inherit
the
earth
far
more
truly
than
those
who
have
bought
and
paid
for
it
the
proof
that
they
feel
this
is
that
they
cannot
be
exiled
with
impunity
that
they
love
the
soil
they
have
watered
with
their
tears
and
that
the
true
peasant
dies
of
homesickness
under
the
arms
of
a
soldier
far
from
his
native
field
but
he
lacks
some
of
my
enjoyments
those
pure
delights
which
should
be
his
by
right
as
a
workman
in
that
immense
temple
which
the
sky
only
is
vast
enough
to
embrace
he
lacks
the
consciousness
of
his
sentiment
those
who
condemned
him
to
slavery
from
his
mother
s
womb
being
unable
to
rob
him
of
his
vague
dreams
took
away
from
him
the
power
of
reflection
yet
imperfect
being
that
he
is
sentenced
to
eternal
childhood
he
is
nobler
than
the
man
in
whom
knowledge
has
stifled
feeling
do
not
set
yourselves
above
him
you
who
believe
yourselves
invested
with
a
lawful
and
inalienable
right
to
rule
over
him
for
your
terrible
mistake
shows
that
your
brain
has
destroyed
your
heart
and
that
you
are
the
blindest
and
most
incomplete
of
men
i
love
the
simplicity
of
his
soul
more
than
the
false
lights
of
yours
and
if
i
had
to
narrate
the
story
of
his
life
the
pleasure
i
should
take
in
bringing
out
the
tender
and
touching
side
of
it
would
be
greater
than
your
merit
in
painting
the
degradation
and
contempt
into
which
he
is
cast
by
your
social
code
i
knew
the
young
man
and
the
beautiful
child
i
knew
their
history
for
they
had
a
history
everybody
has
his
own
and
could
make
the
romance
of
his
life
interesting
if
he
could
but
understand
it
although
but
a
peasant
and
a
laborer
germain
had
always
been
aware
of
his
duties
and
affections
he
had
related
them
to
me
clearly
and
ingenuously
and
i
had
listened
with
interest
after
some
time
spent
in
watching
him
plow
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
write
his
story
though
that
story
were
as
simple
as
straightforward
and
unadorned
as
the
furrow
he
was
tracing
next
year
that
furrow
will
be
filled
and
covered
by
a
fresh
one
thus
disappear
most
of
the
footprints
made
by
man
in
the
field
of
human
life
a
little
earth
obliterates
them
and
the
furrows
we
have
dug
succeed
one
another
like
graves
in
a
cemetery
is
not
the
furrow
of
the
laborer
of
as
much
value
as
that
of
the
idler
even
if
that
idler
by
some
absurd
chance
have
made
a
little
noise
in
the
world
and
left
behind
him
an
abiding
name
i
mean
if
possible
to
save
from
oblivion
the
furrow
of
germain
the
skilled
husbandman
he
will
never
know
nor
care
but
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
my
talk

ii
father
maurice
germain
said
his
fatherinlaw
one
day
you
must
decide
about
marrying
again
it
is
almost
two
years
now
since
you
lost
my
daughter
and
your
eldest
boy
is
seven
years
old
you
are
almost
thirty
my
boy
and
you
know
that
in
our
country
a
man
is
considered
too
old
to
go
to
housekeeping
again
after
that
age
you
have
three
nice
children
and
thus
far
they
have
not
proved
a
burden
to
us
at
all
my
wife
and
my
daughterinlaw
have
looked
after
them
as
well
as
they
could
and
loved
them
as
they
ought
here
is
petitpierre
almost
grown
up
he
goads
the
oxen
very
well
he
knows
how
to
look
after
the
cattle
and
he
is
strong
enough
to
drive
the
horses
to
the
trough
so
it
is
not
he
that
worries
us
but
the
other
two
love
them
though
we
do
god
knows
the
poor
little
innocents
give
us
trouble
enough
this
year
my
daughterinlaw
is
about
to
lie
in
and
she
has
yet
another
baby
to
attend
to
when
the
child
we
are
expecting
comes
she
will
not
be
able
to
look
after
your
little
solange
and
above
all
your
sylvain
who
is
not
four
years
old
and
who
is
never
quiet
day
or
night
he
has
a
restless
disposition
like
yours
that
will
make
a
good
workman
of
him
but
it
makes
a
dreadful
child
and
my
old
wife
cannot
run
fast
enough
to
save
him
when
he
almost
tumbles
into
the
ditch
or
when
he
throws
himself
in
front
of
the
tramping
cattle
and
then
with
this
other
that
my
daughterinlaw
is
going
to
bring
into
the
world
for
a
month
at
least
her
next
older
child
will
fall
on
my
wife
s
hands
besides
your
children
worry
us
and
give
us
too
much
to
do
we
hate
to
see
children
badly
looked
after
and
when
we
think
of
the
accidents
that
may
befall
them
for
want
of
care
we
cannot
rest
so
you
need
another
wife
and
i
another
daughterinlaw
think
this
over
my
son
i
have
called
it
to
your
mind
before
time
flies
and
the
years
will
not
wait
a
moment
for
you
it
is
your
duty
to
your
children
and
to
the
rest
of
us
who
wish
all
well
at
home
to
marry
as
soon
as
you
can
very
well
father
answered
the
soninlaw
if
you
really
wish
it
i
must
do
as
you
say
but
i
do
not
wish
to
hide
it
from
you
that
it
will
make
me
very
sad
and
that
i
hardly
wish
for
anything
but
to
drown
myself
we
know
who
it
is
we
lose
we
never
know
whom
we
find
i
had
a
good
wife
a
pretty
wife
sweet
brave
good
to
her
father
and
mother
good
to
her
husband
good
to
her
children
good
to
toil
in
the
fields
and
in
the
house
well
fitted
to
workin
short
good
for
everything
and
when
you
had
given
her
to
me
and
i
took
her
we
did
not
place
it
among
our
promises
that
i
should
go
and
forget
about
her
if
i
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
her
what
you
say
shows
your
good
heart
germain
answered
father
maurice
i
know
that
you
loved
my
daughter
and
that
you
made
her
happy
and
that
had
you
been
able
to
satisfy
death
by
going
in
her
place
catherine
would
be
alive
today
and
you
would
be
in
the
graveyard
she
deserved
all
your
love
and
if
you
are
not
consoled
neither
are
we
but
i
do
not
speak
to
you
of
forgetting
her
god
wished
her
to
leave
us
and
we
do
not
let
a
day
go
by
without
telling
him
in
our
prayers
and
thoughts
and
words
and
actions
that
we
keep
her
memory
and
still
sorrow
for
her
loss
but
if
she
could
speak
to
you
from
the
other
world
and
let
you
know
what
she
wishes
she
would
tell
you
to
find
a
mother
for
her
little
orphans
so
the
question
is
to
find
a
woman
who
will
be
worthy
to
take
her
place
it
will
not
be
easy
but
it
is
not
impossible
and
when
we
shall
find
her
for
you
you
will
love
her
as
you
used
to
love
my
daughter
because
you
are
a
good
man
and
because
you
will
be
thankful
to
her
for
helping
us
and
for
loving
your
children
very
well
father
maurice
i
shall
do
as
you
wish
as
i
have
always
done
it
is
only
justice
my
son
to
say
that
you
have
always
listened
to
the
friendly
advice
and
good
judgment
of
the
head
of
the
house
so
let
us
consult
about
your
choice
of
a
new
wife
first
i
don
t
advise
you
to
take
a
young
girl
that
is
not
what
you
need
youth
is
careless
and
as
it
is
hard
work
to
bring
up
three
children
especially
when
they
are
of
another
bed
you
must
have
a
good
soul
wise
and
gentle
and
well
used
to
work
if
your
wife
is
not
about
the
same
age
as
you
she
will
have
no
reason
to
accept
such
a
duty
she
will
find
you
too
old
and
your
children
too
young
she
will
be
complaining
and
your
children
will
suffer
this
is
just
what
makes
me
uneasy
suppose
the
poor
little
things
should
be
badly
treated
hated
beaten
god
grant
not
answered
the
old
man
but
bad
women
are
more
rare
with
us
than
good
and
we
shall
be
stupid
if
we
cannot
pick
out
somebody
who
will
suit
us
that
is
true
father
there
are
good
girls
in
our
village
there
is
louise
sylvaine
claudie
margueriteyes
anybody
you
want
gently
gently
my
boy
all
these
girls
are
too
young
or
too
poor
or
too
pretty
for
surely
we
must
think
of
that
too
my
son
a
pretty
woman
is
not
always
as
well
behaved
as
another
then
you
wish
me
to
take
an
ugly
wife
said
germain
a
little
uneasy
no
not
ugly
at
all
for
this
woman
will
bear
you
other
children
and
there
is
nothing
more
miserable
than
to
have
children
who
are
ugly
and
weak
and
sickly
but
a
woman
still
fresh
and
in
good
health
who
is
neither
pretty
nor
ugly
would
suit
you
exactly
i
am
quite
sure
said
germain
smiling
rather
sadly
that
to
get
such
a
woman
as
you
wish
you
must
have
her
made
to
order
all
the
more
because
you
don
t
wish
her
to
be
poor
and
the
rich
are
not
easy
to
get
particularly
for
a
widower
and
suppose
she
were
a
widow
herself
germain
a
widow
without
children
and
with
a
good
portion
for
the
moment
i
cannot
think
of
anybody
like
this
in
our
parish
nor
i
either
but
there
are
others
elsewhere
you
have
somebody
in
mind
father
then
tell
me
at
once
who
it
is
illustration
ornament
iii
germain
the
skilled
husbandman
yes
i
have
somebody
in
mind
replied
father
maurice
it
is
a
leonard
the
widow
of
a
guérin
she
lives
at
fourche
i
know
neither
the
woman
nor
the
place
answered
germain
resigned
but
growing
more
and
more
melancholy
her
name
is
catherine
like
your
dead
wife
s
catherine
yes
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
to
pronounce
that
name
catherine
and
yet
if
i
cannot
love
one
as
much
as
the
other
it
will
pain
me
all
the
more
it
will
bring
her
to
my
mind
more
often
i
tell
you
you
will
love
her
she
is
a
good
soul
a
woman
with
a
warm
heart
i
have
not
seen
her
for
a
long
time
she
was
not
an
ugly
girl
then
but
she
is
no
longer
young
she
is
thirtytwo
she
comes
of
a
good
family
honest
people
all
of
them
and
for
property
she
has
eight
or
ten
thousand
francs
in
land
which
she
would
sell
gladly
in
order
to
invest
in
the
place
where
she
settles
for
she
too
is
thinking
of
marrying
again
and
i
know
that
if
your
character
pleases
her
she
will
not
be
dissatisfied
with
your
situation
so
you
have
made
all
the
arrangements
yes
except
that
i
have
not
had
an
opinion
from
either
of
you
and
that
is
what
you
must
ask
each
other
when
you
meet
the
woman
s
father
is
a
distant
connection
of
mine
and
he
has
been
a
good
friend
to
me
you
know
father
leonard
well
yes
i
have
seen
you
two
talking
at
the
market
and
at
the
last
you
lunched
together
then
it
was
about
her
that
he
spoke
to
you
so
long
certainly
he
watched
you
selling
your
cattle
and
saw
that
you
drove
a
shrewd
bargain
and
that
you
were
a
goodlooking
fellow
and
appeared
active
and
intelligent
and
when
i
told
him
what
a
good
fellow
you
were
and
how
well
you
have
behaved
toward
us
without
one
word
of
vexation
or
anger
during
the
eight
years
we
have
been
living
and
working
together
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
marry
you
to
his
daughter
this
suits
me
too
i
admit
when
i
think
of
her
good
reputation
and
the
honesty
of
her
family
and
the
prosperous
condition
i
know
her
affairs
are
in
i
see
father
maurice
that
you
have
an
eye
to
money
of
course
i
do
you
have
too
have
you
not
i
do
look
toward
it
if
you
wish
for
your
sake
but
you
know
that
for
my
own
part
i
don
t
worry
whether
i
gain
or
not
in
what
we
make
i
don
t
understand
about
profitsharing
i
have
no
head
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
understand
the
ground
i
understand
cattle
horses
carts
sowing
threshing
and
provender
as
for
sheep
and
vineyards
and
vegetables
petty
profits
and
fine
gardening
you
know
that
is
your
son
s
business
i
don
t
have
much
to
do
with
it
as
to
money
my
memory
is
short
and
i
should
rather
give
up
everything
than
fight
about
what
is
yours
and
what
is
mine
i
should
be
afraid
of
making
some
mistake
and
claiming
what
does
not
belong
to
me
and
if
business
were
not
so
clear
and
simple
i
should
never
find
my
way
in
it
so
much
the
worse
my
son
and
this
is
the
reason
i
wish
you
to
have
a
wife
with
a
clear
head
to
fill
my
place
when
i
am
gone
you
never
wished
to
understand
our
accounts
and
this
might
lead
you
into
a
quarrel
with
my
son
when
you
don
t
have
me
any
longer
to
keep
you
in
harmony
and
decide
what
is
each
one
s
share
may
you
live
long
father
maurice
but
do
not
worry
about
what
will
happen
when
you
die
i
shall
never
quarrel
with
your
son
i
trust
jacques
as
i
do
you
and
as
i
have
no
property
of
my
own
and
all
that
might
accrue
to
me
comes
from
your
daughter
and
belongs
to
our
children
i
can
rest
easy
and
you
too
jacques
would
never
rob
his
sister
s
children
for
the
sake
of
his
own
for
he
loves
them
all
equally
you
are
right
germain
jacques
is
a
good
son
a
good
brother
and
a
man
who
loves
the
truth
but
jacques
may
die
before
you
before
your
children
grow
up
and
in
a
family
we
must
always
remember
never
to
leave
children
without
a
head
to
look
after
them
and
govern
their
disagreements
otherwise
the
lawyerpeople
mix
themselves
up
in
it
stir
them
up
to
fight
and
make
them
eat
up
everything
in
lawsuits
so
we
ought
not
to
think
of
bringing
home
another
person
man
or
woman
without
remembering
that
some
day
or
other
that
person
may
have
to
control
the
behavior
and
business
of
twenty
or
thirty
children
and
grandchildren
sonsinlaw
and
daughtersinlaw
we
never
know
how
big
a
family
can
grow
and
when
a
hive
is
so
full
that
the
bees
must
form
new
swarms
each
one
wishes
to
carry
off
her
share
of
the
honey
when
i
took
you
for
my
son
although
my
daughter
was
rich
and
you
were
poor
i
never
reproached
her
for
choosing
you
i
saw
that
you
were
a
hard
worker
and
i
knew
very
well
that
the
best
fortune
for
people
in
such
a
country
as
ours
is
a
pair
of
arms
and
a
heart
like
yours
when
a
man
brings
these
into
a
family
he
brings
enough
but
with
a
woman
it
is
different
her
work
indoors
saves
but
it
does
not
gain
besides
now
that
you
are
a
father
looking
for
a
second
wife
you
must
remember
that
your
new
children
will
have
no
claim
on
the
property
of
your
children
by
another
wife
and
if
you
should
happen
to
die
they
might
suffer
very
muchat
least
if
your
wife
had
no
money
in
her
own
right
and
then
the
children
which
you
will
add
to
our
colony
will
cost
something
to
bring
up
if
that
fell
on
us
alone
we
should
surely
take
care
of
them
without
a
word
of
complaint
but
the
comfort
of
everybody
would
suffer
and
your
eldest
children
would
bear
their
share
of
hardship
when
families
grow
too
large
if
money
does
not
keep
pace
misery
comes
no
matter
how
bravely
you
bear
up
this
is
what
i
wished
to
say
germain
think
it
over
and
try
to
make
the
widow
guérin
like
you
for
her
discretion
and
her
dollars
will
help
us
now
and
make
us
feel
easy
about
the
future
that
is
true
father
i
shall
try
to
please
her
and
to
like
her
to
do
that
you
must
go
to
find
her
and
see
her
at
her
own
place
at
fourche
that
is
a
great
way
from
here
is
it
not
and
we
scarcely
have
time
to
run
off
at
this
season
of
the
year
when
it
is
a
question
of
a
lovematch
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
lose
time
but
when
it
is
a
sensible
marriage
of
two
people
who
take
no
sudden
fancies
and
know
what
they
want
it
is
very
soon
decided
tomorrow
is
saturday
you
will
make
your
day
s
work
a
little
shorter
than
usual
you
must
start
after
dinner
about
two
o
clock
you
will
be
at
fourche
by
nightfall
the
moon
rises
early
the
roads
are
good
and
it
is
not
more
than
three
leagues
distant
it
is
near
magnier
besides
you
will
take
the
mare
i
had
just
as
lief
go
afoot
in
this
cool
weather
yes
but
the
mare
is
pretty
and
a
suitor
looks
better
when
he
comes
well
mounted
you
must
put
on
your
new
clothes
and
carry
a
nice
present
of
game
to
father
leonard
you
will
come
from
me
and
talk
with
him
pass
all
of
sunday
with
his
daughter
and
come
back
monday
morning
with
a
yes
or
no
very
well
answered
germain
calmly
and
yet
he
did
not
feel
very
calm
germain
had
always
lived
soberly
as
industrious
peasants
do
married
at
twenty
he
had
loved
but
one
woman
in
his
life
and
after
her
death
impulsive
and
gay
as
his
nature
was
he
had
never
played
nor
trifled
with
another
he
had
borne
a
real
sorrow
faithfully
in
his
heart
and
it
was
not
without
misgiving
nor
without
sadness
that
he
yielded
to
his
fatherinlaw
but
that
father
had
always
governed
the
family
wisely
and
germain
entirely
devoted
as
he
was
to
the
common
welfare
and
so
by
consequence
to
the
head
of
the
house
who
represented
it
could
not
understand
that
he
might
have
wronged
his
own
good
sense
and
hurt
the
interests
of
all
nevertheless
he
was
sad
few
days
went
by
when
he
did
not
cry
in
secret
for
his
wife
and
although
loneliness
began
to
weigh
on
him
he
was
more
afraid
of
entering
into
a
new
marriage
than
desirous
of
finding
a
support
in
his
sorrow
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
love
might
have
consoled
him
by
coming
to
him
of
a
sudden
for
this
is
the
only
way
love
can
console
we
never
find
it
when
we
seek
it
it
comes
over
us
unawares
this
coldblooded
scheme
of
marriage
that
father
maurice
had
opened
to
him
this
unknown
woman
he
was
to
take
for
his
bride
perhaps
even
all
that
had
been
said
to
him
of
her
virtue
and
good
sense
made
him
pause
to
think
and
he
went
away
musing
as
men
do
whose
thoughts
are
too
few
to
divide
into
hostile
factions
not
scraping
up
fine
arguments
for
rebellion
and
selfishness
but
suffering
from
a
dull
grief
submissive
to
ills
from
which
there
is
no
escape
meanwhile
father
maurice
had
returned
to
the
farm
while
germain
between
sunset
and
dark
spent
the
closing
hour
of
the
day
in
repairing
gaps
the
sheep
had
made
in
the
hedge
of
a
yard
near
the
farmbuildings
he
lifted
up
the
branches
of
the
thornbushes
and
held
them
in
place
with
clods
of
earth
whilst
the
thrushes
chattered
in
the
neighboring
thicket
and
seemed
to
call
to
him
to
hurry
for
they
were
eager
to
come
and
see
his
work
as
soon
as
he
had
gone

iv
mother
guillette
father
maurice
found
at
his
house
an
old
neighbor
who
had
come
to
talk
with
his
wife
seeking
at
the
same
time
to
secure
a
few
embers
to
light
her
fire
mother
guillette
lived
in
a
wretched
hut
two
gunshots
away
from
the
farm
still
she
was
a
willing
and
an
orderly
woman
her
poor
dwelling
was
clean
and
neat
and
the
care
with
which
her
clothes
were
mended
showed
that
she
respected
herself
in
the
midst
of
her
penury
you
have
come
to
fetch
your
evening
fire
mother
guillette
said
the
old
man
to
her
is
there
anything
else
you
want
no
father
maurice
answered
she
nothing
for
the
present
i
am
no
beggar
as
you
know
and
i
take
care
not
to
abuse
the
kindness
of
my
friends
that
is
very
true
besides
your
friends
are
always
ready
to
do
you
a
service
i
was
just
talking
to
your
wife
and
i
was
asking
her
if
germain
had
finally
decided
to
marry
again
you
are
no
gossip
replied
father
maurice
we
can
talk
in
your
presence
without
having
any
foolish
talebearing
to
fear
so
i
will
tell
my
wife
and
you
that
germain
has
made
up
his
mind
absolutely
tomorrow
morning
he
starts
for
the
farm
at
fourche
good
enough
cried
mother
maurice
poor
child
god
grant
he
may
find
a
woman
as
good
and
true
as
he
so
he
is
going
to
fourche
remarked
mother
guillette
how
lucky
that
is
it
is
exactly
what
i
want
and
since
you
were
just
asking
me
if
there
were
anything
i
wished
for
i
am
going
to
tell
you
father
maurice
how
you
can
do
me
a
service
tell
me
what
it
is
we
like
to
help
you
i
wish
germain
would
be
so
kind
as
to
take
my
daughter
along
with
him
where
to
fourche
no
not
to
fourche
but
to
ormeaux
she
is
to
stay
there
the
rest
of
the
year
what
exclaimed
mother
maurice
are
you
going
to
separate
from
your
daughter
she
must
go
out
to
work
and
earn
her
living
i
am
sorry
enough
and
she
is
too
poor
soul
we
could
not
make
up
our
minds
to
part
saint
john
s
day
but
now
that
saint
martin
s
is
upon
us
she
finds
a
good
place
as
shepherdess
at
the
farms
at
ormeaux
on
his
way
home
from
the
fair
the
other
day
the
farmer
passed
by
here
he
caught
sight
of
my
little
marie
tending
her
three
sheep
on
the
common
you
have
hardly
enough
to
do
my
little
girl
said
he
three
sheep
are
not
enough
for
a
shepherdess
would
you
like
to
take
care
of
a
hundred
i
will
take
you
along
our
shepherdess
has
fallen
sick
she
is
going
back
to
her
family
and
if
you
will
be
at
our
farm
before
a
week
is
over
you
shall
have
fifty
francs
for
the
rest
of
the
year
up
to
saint
john
s
day
the
child
refused
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
it
over
and
telling
me
about
it
when
she
came
home
in
the
evening
and
found
me
downhearted
and
worried
about
the
winter
which
was
sure
to
be
hard
and
long
for
this
year
the
cranes
and
wild
ducks
were
seen
crossing
the
sky
a
whole
month
before
they
generally
do
we
both
of
us
cried
but
after
a
time
we
took
heart
we
knew
that
we
could
not
stay
together
since
it
is
hard
enough
for
one
person
to
get
a
living
from
our
little
patch
of
ground
then
since
marie
is
old
enoughfor
she
is
going
on
to
sixteenshe
must
do
like
the
rest
earn
her
own
living
and
help
her
poor
mother
mother
guillette
said
the
old
laborer
if
it
were
only
fifty
francs
you
needed
to
help
you
out
of
your
trouble
and
save
you
from
sending
away
your
daughter
i
should
certainly
find
them
for
you
although
fifty
francs
is
no
trifle
for
people
like
us
but
in
everything
we
must
consult
common
sense
as
well
as
friendship
to
be
saved
from
want
this
year
will
not
keep
you
from
want
in
the
future
and
the
longer
your
daughter
takes
to
make
up
her
mind
the
harder
you
both
will
find
it
to
part
little
marie
is
growing
tall
and
strong
she
has
not
enough
at
home
to
keep
her
busy
she
might
get
into
lazy
habits
oh
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
exclaimed
mother
guillette
marie
is
as
active
as
a
rich
girl
at
the
head
of
a
large
family
can
be
she
never
sits
still
with
her
arms
folded
for
an
instant
and
when
we
have
no
work
to
do
she
keeps
dusting
and
polishing
our
old
furniture
until
it
shines
like
a
mirror
the
child
is
worth
her
weight
in
gold
and
i
should
much
rather
have
her
enter
your
service
as
a
shepherdess
than
go
so
far
away
to
people
i
don
t
know
you
would
have
taken
her
at
saint
john
s
day
but
now
you
have
hired
all
your
hands
and
we
cannot
think
of
that
till
saint
john
s
day
next
year
yes
i
consent
with
all
my
heart
guillette
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
take
her
but
in
the
mean
time
she
will
do
well
to
learn
her
work
and
accustom
herself
to
obey
others
yes
that
is
true
no
doubt
the
die
is
cast
the
farmer
at
ormeaux
sent
to
ask
about
her
this
morning
we
consented
and
she
must
go
but
the
poor
child
does
not
know
the
way
and
i
should
not
like
to
send
her
so
far
alone
since
your
soninlaw
goes
to
fourche
tomorrow
perhaps
he
can
take
her
it
seems
that
fourche
is
close
to
her
journey
s
end
at
least
so
they
tell
me
for
i
have
never
made
the
trip
myself
it
is
very
near
indeed
and
my
son
will
show
her
the
way
naturally
he
might
even
take
her
up
behind
him
on
the
mare
that
will
save
her
shoes
here
he
comes
for
supper
tell
me
germain
mother
guillette
s
little
marie
is
going
to
become
a
shepherdess
at
ormeaux
will
you
take
her
there
on
your
horse
certainly
answered
germain
who
troubled
as
he
was
never
felt
indisposed
to
do
a
kindness
to
his
neighbor
in
our
community
a
mother
would
not
think
of
such
a
thing
as
to
trust
a
girl
of
sixteen
to
a
man
of
twentyeight
for
germain
was
really
but
twentyeight
and
although
according
to
the
notions
of
the
country
people
he
was
considered
rather
old
to
marry
he
was
still
the
bestlooking
man
in
the
neighborhood
toil
had
not
wrinkled
and
worn
him
as
it
does
most
peasants
who
have
passed
ten
years
in
tilling
the
soil
he
was
strong
enough
to
labor
for
ten
more
years
without
showing
signs
of
age
and
the
prejudices
of
her
time
must
have
weighed
heavily
on
the
mind
of
a
young
girl
to
prevent
her
from
seeing
that
germain
had
a
fresh
complexion
eyes
sparkling
and
blue
as
skies
in
may
ruddy
lips
fine
teeth
and
a
body
well
shaped
and
lithe
as
a
young
horse
that
has
never
yet
left
his
pasture
but
purity
of
manners
is
a
sacred
custom
in
some
districts
far
distant
from
the
corrupted
life
of
great
cities
and
amongst
all
the
households
of
belair
the
family
of
maurice
was
known
to
be
honest
and
truthloving
germain
was
on
his
way
to
find
a
wife
marie
was
a
child
too
young
and
too
poor
to
be
thought
of
in
this
light
and
unless
he
were
a
heartless
and
a
bad
man
he
could
not
entertain
one
evil
thought
concerning
her
father
maurice
felt
no
uneasiness
at
seeing
him
take
the
pretty
girl
on
the
crupper
mother
guillette
would
have
thought
herself
doing
him
a
wrong
had
she
asked
him
to
respect
her
daughter
as
his
sister
marie
embraced
her
mother
and
her
young
friends
twenty
times
and
then
mounted
the
mare
in
tears
germain
sad
on
his
own
account
felt
all
the
more
sympathy
for
her
sorrow
and
rode
away
with
a
melancholy
air
while
all
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
waved
goodby
to
marie
without
a
thought
of
harm

v
petitpierre
the
gray
was
young
goodlooking
and
strong
she
carried
her
double
burden
with
ease
laying
back
her
ears
and
champing
her
bit
like
the
highspirited
mare
she
was
passing
in
front
of
the
pasture
she
caught
sight
of
her
mother
whose
name
was
the
old
gray
as
hers
was
the
young
gray
and
she
whinnied
in
token
of
goodby
the
old
gray
came
nearer
the
hedge
and
striking
her
shoes
together
she
tried
to
gallop
along
the
edge
of
the
field
in
order
to
follow
her
daughter
then
seeing
her
fall
into
a
sharp
trot
the
mare
whinnied
in
her
turn
and
stood
in
an
uneasy
attitude
her
nose
in
the
air
and
her
mouth
filled
with
grass
that
she
had
no
thought
of
eating
that
poor
beast
always
knows
her
offspring
said
germain
trying
to
keep
marie
s
thoughts
from
her
troubles
that
reminds
me
i
never
kissed
petitpierre
before
i
started
the
naughty
boy
was
not
there
last
night
he
wished
to
make
me
promise
to
take
him
along
and
he
wept
for
an
hour
in
bed
this
morning
again
he
tried
everything
to
persuade
me
oh
how
sly
and
coaxing
he
is
but
when
he
saw
that
he
could
not
gain
his
point
the
young
gentleman
got
into
a
temper
he
went
off
to
the
fields
and
i
have
not
seen
him
all
day
i
have
seen
him
said
little
marie
striving
to
keep
back
her
tears
he
was
running
toward
the
clearing
with
soulas
children
and
i
felt
sure
that
he
had
been
away
from
home
a
long
time
for
he
was
hungry
and
was
eating
wild
plums
and
blackberries
i
gave
him
the
bread
i
had
for
lunch
and
he
said
thank
you
dear
marie
when
you
come
to
our
house
i
will
give
you
some
cake
he
is
a
dear
little
child
germain
yes
he
is
answered
the
laborer
and
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
him
if
his
grandmother
had
not
more
sense
than
i
i
could
not
have
helped
taking
him
with
me
when
i
saw
him
crying
as
though
his
poor
little
heart
would
burst
then
why
did
you
not
take
him
germain
he
would
have
been
very
little
trouble
he
is
so
good
when
you
please
him
he
would
probably
have
been
in
the
way
in
the
place
where
i
am
going
at
least
father
maurice
thought
so
on
the
other
hand
i
should
have
thought
it
well
to
see
how
they
received
him
for
no
one
could
help
being
kind
to
such
a
nice
child
but
at
home
they
said
that
i
must
not
begin
by
showing
off
all
the
cares
of
the
household
i
don
t
know
why
i
speak
of
this
to
you
little
marie
you
can
t
understand
oh
yes
i
do
i
know
that
you
are
going
away
to
marry
my
mother
spoke
to
me
about
it
and
told
me
not
to
mention
it
to
a
soul
either
at
home
or
at
my
destination
and
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
shall
not
breathe
a
word
about
it
you
are
very
right
for
the
deed
isn
t
done
yet
perhaps
i
shall
not
suit
this
woman
i
hope
you
will
germain
why
should
you
not
suit
her
who
knows
i
have
three
children
and
that
is
a
heavy
burden
for
a
woman
who
is
not
their
mother
very
true
but
are
not
your
children
like
other
children
do
you
think
so
they
are
lovely
as
little
angels
and
so
well
brought
up
that
you
can
t
find
better
children
there
s
sylvain
he
is
none
too
obedient
he
is
so
very
little
he
can
t
help
being
naughty
but
he
is
very
bright
he
is
bright
it
is
true
and
very
brave
he
is
not
afraid
of
cows
nor
bulls
and
if
he
were
given
his
own
way
he
would
be
climbing
on
horseback
already
with
his
elder
brother
had
i
been
in
your
place
i
would
have
taken
the
eldest
boy
along
surely
people
would
have
liked
you
at
once
for
having
such
a
pretty
child
yes
if
a
woman
is
fond
of
children
but
if
she
is
not
are
there
women
who
don
t
love
children
not
many
i
think
but
still
there
are
some
and
that
is
what
troubles
me
you
don
t
know
this
woman
at
all
then
no
more
than
you
and
i
fear
that
i
shall
not
know
her
better
after
i
have
seen
her
i
am
not
suspicious
when
people
say
nice
things
to
me
i
believe
them
but
more
than
once
i
have
had
good
reason
to
repent
for
words
are
not
deeds
they
say
that
she
is
a
very
good
woman
who
says
so
father
maurice
yes
your
fatherinlaw
that
is
all
very
well
but
he
knows
her
no
more
than
i
well
you
will
soon
see
pay
close
attention
and
let
us
hope
that
you
will
not
be
deceived
i
have
it
little
marie
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
come
into
the
house
for
a
minute
before
you
go
straight
on
to
ormeaux
you
are
quickwitted
you
have
always
shown
that
you
are
not
stupid
and
nothing
escapes
your
notice
should
you
see
anything
to
rouse
your
suspicions
you
must
warn
me
of
it
very
quietly
oh
no
germain
i
will
not
do
that
i
should
be
too
much
afraid
of
making
a
mistake
and
besides
if
a
word
lightly
spoken
were
to
turn
you
against
this
marriage
your
family
would
bear
me
a
grudge
and
i
have
plenty
of
troubles
now
without
bringing
any
more
on
my
poor
dear
mother
as
they
were
talking
thus
the
gray
pricked
up
her
ears
and
shied
then
returning
on
her
steps
she
approached
the
bushes
where
she
began
to
recognize
something
which
had
frightened
her
at
first
germain
cast
his
eye
over
the
thicket
and
in
a
ditch
beneath
the
branches
of
a
scruboak
still
thick
and
green
he
saw
something
which
he
took
for
a
lamb
the
little
creature
is
strayed
or
dead
for
it
does
not
move
perhaps
some
one
is
looking
for
it
we
must
see
it
is
not
an
animal
cried
little
marie
it
is
a
sleeping
child
it
is
your
petitpierre
heavens
exclaimed
germain
see
the
little
scamp
asleep
so
far
away
from
home
and
in
a
ditch
where
a
snake
might
bite
him
he
lifted
up
the
child
who
smiled
as
he
opened
his
eyes
and
threw
his
arms
about
his
father
s
neck
saying
dear
little
father
you
are
going
to
take
me
with
you
oh
yes
always
the
same
tune
what
were
you
doing
there
you
naughty
pierre
i
was
waiting
for
my
little
father
to
go
by
i
was
watching
the
road
and
i
watched
so
hard
that
i
fell
asleep
and
if
i
had
passed
by
without
seeing
you
you
would
have
been
out
of
doors
all
night
and
a
wolf
would
have
eaten
you
up
oh
i
knew
very
well
that
you
would
see
me
answered
petitpierre
confidently
well
kiss
me
now
bid
me
goodby
and
run
back
quickly
to
the
house
unless
you
wish
them
to
have
supper
without
you
are
you
not
going
to
take
me
then
cried
the
little
boy
beginning
to
rub
his
eyes
to
show
that
he
was
thinking
of
tears
you
know
very
well
that
grandpapa
and
grandmama
do
not
wish
it
said
germain
fortifying
himself
behind
the
authority
of
his
elders
like
a
man
who
distrusts
his
own
the
child
would
not
listen
he
began
to
cry
with
all
his
might
saying
that
as
long
as
his
father
was
taking
little
marie
he
might
just
as
well
take
him
too
they
replied
that
they
must
pass
through
great
woods
filled
with
wicked
beasts
who
eat
up
little
children
the
gray
would
not
carry
three
people
she
had
said
so
when
they
were
starting
and
in
the
country
where
they
were
going
there
was
no
bed
and
no
supper
for
little
boys
all
these
good
reasons
could
not
persuade
petitpierre
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
rolled
about
shrieking
that
his
little
father
did
not
love
him
any
more
and
that
if
he
did
not
take
him
he
would
never
go
back
to
the
house
at
all
day
or
night
germain
had
a
father
s
heart
as
soft
and
weak
as
a
woman
s
his
wife
s
death
and
the
care
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
bestow
all
alone
on
his
little
ones
as
well
as
the
thought
that
these
poor
motherless
children
needed
a
great
deal
of
love
combined
to
make
him
thus
so
such
a
sharp
struggle
went
on
within
him
all
the
more
because
he
was
ashamed
of
his
weakness
and
tried
to
hide
his
confusion
from
little
marie
that
the
sweat
started
out
on
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
grew
red
and
almost
ready
to
weep
at
last
he
tried
to
get
angry
but
as
he
turned
toward
little
marie
in
order
to
let
her
witness
his
strength
of
mind
he
saw
that
the
good
girls
face
was
wet
with
tears
all
his
courage
forsook
him
and
he
could
not
keep
back
his
own
scold
and
threaten
as
he
would
truly
your
heart
is
too
hard
said
little
marie
at
last
and
for
myself
i
know
that
i
never
could
refuse
a
child
who
felt
so
badly
come
germain
let
s
take
him
your
mare
is
well
used
to
carrying
two
people
and
a
child
for
you
know
that
your
brotherinlaw
and
his
wife
who
is
much
heavier
than
i
go
to
market
every
saturday
with
their
boy
on
this
good
beast
s
back
take
him
on
the
horse
in
front
of
you
besides
i
should
rather
walk
on
foot
all
alone
than
give
this
little
boy
so
much
pain
never
mind
answered
germain
who
was
dying
to
allow
himself
to
give
way
the
gray
is
strong
and
could
carry
two
more
if
there
were
room
on
her
back
but
what
can
we
do
with
this
child
on
the
way
he
will
be
cold
and
hungry
and
who
will
take
care
of
him
tonight
and
tomorrow
put
him
to
bed
wash
him
and
dress
him
i
don
t
dare
give
this
trouble
to
a
woman
i
don
t
know
who
will
think
doubtless
that
i
am
exceedingly
free
and
easy
with
her
to
begin
with
trust
me
germain
you
will
know
her
at
once
by
the
kindness
or
the
impatience
that
she
shows
if
she
does
not
care
to
receive
your
pierre
i
will
take
charge
of
him
myself
i
will
go
to
her
house
and
dress
him
and
i
will
take
him
to
the
fields
with
me
tomorrow
i
will
amuse
him
all
day
long
and
take
good
care
that
he
does
not
want
for
anything
he
will
tire
you
my
poor
girl
and
give
you
trouble
a
whole
day
is
a
long
time
not
at
all
it
will
give
me
pleasure
he
will
keep
me
company
and
that
will
make
me
less
sad
the
first
day
that
i
must
pass
in
a
new
place
i
shall
fancy
that
i
am
still
at
home
seeing
that
little
marie
was
pleading
for
her
the
child
seized
upon
her
skirt
and
held
it
so
tight
that
they
must
have
hurt
him
in
order
to
tear
it
away
when
he
perceived
that
his
father
was
weakening
he
took
marie
s
hand
in
both
his
tiny
sunburned
fists
and
kissed
her
leaping
for
joy
and
pulling
her
toward
the
mare
with
the
burning
impatience
children
feel
in
their
desires
come
along
said
the
young
girl
lifting
him
in
her
arms
let
us
try
to
quiet
his
poor
little
heart
it
is
fluttering
like
a
little
bird
and
if
you
feel
the
cold
when
night
comes
on
tell
me
my
pierre
and
i
will
wrap
you
in
my
cape
kiss
your
little
father
and
beg
his
pardon
for
being
naughty
tell
him
that
you
will
never
never
be
so
again
do
you
hear
yes
yes
provided
that
i
always
do
just
as
he
wishes
isn
t
it
so
said
germain
drying
the
little
boy
s
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
marie
you
are
spoiling
the
little
rascal
but
really
and
truly
you
are
too
good
little
marie
i
don
t
know
why
you
did
not
come
to
us
as
shepherdess
last
saint
john
s
day
you
would
have
taken
care
of
my
children
and
i
should
much
rather
pay
a
good
price
for
their
sake
than
try
to
find
a
woman
who
will
think
perhaps
she
is
doing
me
a
great
kindness
if
she
does
not
detest
them
you
must
not
look
on
the
dark
side
of
things
answered
little
marie
holding
the
horse
s
bridle
while
germain
placed
his
son
in
front
of
the
big
packsaddle
covered
with
goatskin
if
your
wife
does
not
care
for
children
take
me
into
your
service
next
year
and
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
amuse
them
so
well
that
they
will
not
notice
anything
illustration
ornament
vi
on
the
heath
dear
me
said
germain
after
they
had
gone
a
few
steps
farther
what
will
they
think
at
home
when
they
miss
the
little
man
the
family
will
be
worried
and
will
be
looking
everywhere
for
him
you
can
tell
the
man
who
is
mending
the
road
up
there
that
you
are
taking
him
along
and
ask
him
to
speak
to
your
people
that
is
very
true
marie
you
don
t
forget
anything
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
jeannie
must
be
there
he
lives
close
to
the
farm
and
he
will
not
fail
to
do
your
errand
when
they
had
taken
this
precaution
germain
put
the
mare
to
a
trot
and
petitpierre
was
so
overjoyed
that
for
a
time
he
forgot
that
he
had
gone
without
his
dinner
but
the
motion
of
the
horse
gave
him
a
hollow
feeling
in
his
stomach
and
at
the
end
of
a
league
he
began
to
gape
and
grow
pale
and
confessed
that
he
was
dying
of
hunger
this
is
the
way
it
begins
exclaimed
germain
i
was
quite
sure
that
we
should
not
go
far
without
this
young
gentleman
crying
with
hunger
or
thirst
i
am
thirsty
too
said
petitpierre
very
well
then
let
s
go
to
mother
rebec
s
tavern
at
corlay
the
sign
of
the
dawn
a
pretty
sign
but
a
poor
lodging
you
will
take
something
to
drink
too
will
you
not
marie
no
no
i
don
t
want
anything
i
will
hold
the
mare
while
you
go
in
with
the
child
but
i
remember
my
good
girl
that
this
morning
you
gave
the
bread
from
your
own
breakfast
to
my
pierre
you
have
had
nothing
to
eat
you
would
not
take
dinner
with
us
at
home
you
would
do
nothing
but
cry
oh
i
was
not
hungry
i
felt
too
sad
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
even
now
i
have
no
desire
to
eat
you
must
oblige
yourself
to
eat
little
girl
else
you
will
fall
sick
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
and
it
will
not
do
to
arrive
halfstarved
and
beg
for
bread
before
we
say
how
d
ye
do
i
shall
set
you
a
good
example
myself
although
i
am
not
very
hungry
and
i
am
sure
that
i
can
for
after
all
i
did
not
eat
any
dinner
i
saw
you
crying
you
and
your
mother
and
it
made
me
feel
sad
come
along
i
am
going
to
tie
the
gray
at
the
door
get
down
i
wish
you
to
all
three
entered
the
inn
and
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
the
fat
lame
hostess
was
able
to
place
before
them
a
nicelooking
omelette
some
brown
bread
and
a
bottle
of
light
wine
peasants
do
not
eat
quickly
and
little
pierre
had
such
a
good
appetite
that
a
whole
hour
passed
before
germain
could
think
of
starting
out
again
at
first
little
marie
ate
in
order
to
be
obliging
then
little
by
little
she
grew
hungry
for
at
sixteen
a
girl
cannot
fast
for
long
and
country
air
is
dictatorial
the
kind
words
with
which
germain
knew
how
to
comfort
her
and
strengthen
her
courage
produced
their
effect
she
tried
hard
to
persuade
herself
that
seven
months
would
soon
be
over
and
to
think
of
the
pleasure
in
store
for
her
when
she
saw
once
more
her
family
and
her
hamlet
for
father
maurice
and
germain
had
both
promised
to
take
her
into
their
service
but
just
as
she
began
to
cheer
up
and
play
with
little
pierre
germain
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
point
out
to
her
from
the
inn
window
the
lovely
view
of
the
valley
which
can
all
be
seen
from
this
height
and
which
looks
so
happy
and
green
and
fertile
marie
looked
and
asked
if
the
houses
of
belair
were
in
sight
no
doubt
said
germain
and
the
farm
too
and
even
your
housesee
that
tiny
gray
spot
not
far
from
godard
s
big
poplar
below
the
belfry
ah
i
see
it
said
the
little
girl
and
then
she
began
to
cry
i
ought
not
to
have
made
you
think
of
it
said
germain
i
can
do
nothing
but
stupid
things
today
come
along
marie
let
s
start
and
in
an
hour
when
the
moon
rises
it
will
not
be
hot
they
resumed
their
journey
across
the
great
heath
and
for
fear
of
tiring
the
young
girl
and
the
child
by
too
rapid
a
trot
germain
did
not
make
the
gray
go
very
fast
the
sun
had
set
when
they
left
the
road
to
enter
the
wood
germain
knew
the
way
as
far
as
magnier
but
he
thought
it
would
be
shorter
to
avoid
the
chantaloube
road
and
descend
by
presles
and
la
sépulture
a
route
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
taking
on
his
way
to
the
fair
he
lost
his
way
and
wasted
more
time
before
he
reached
the
wood
even
then
he
did
not
enter
it
on
the
right
side
although
he
did
not
perceive
his
mistake
so
that
he
turned
his
back
on
fourche
and
took
a
direction
higher
up
on
the
way
to
ardente
he
was
prevented
still
further
from
finding
his
way
by
a
thick
mist
which
rose
as
the
night
fell
one
of
those
mists
which
come
on
autumn
evenings
when
the
whiteness
of
the
moonlight
renders
them
more
undefined
and
more
treacherous
the
great
pools
of
water
scattered
through
the
glades
gave
forth
a
vapor
so
dense
that
when
the
gray
crossed
them
their
presence
was
known
only
by
a
splashing
noise
and
the
difficulty
with
which
she
drew
her
feet
from
the
mud
at
last
they
found
a
good
straight
road
and
when
they
came
to
the
end
of
it
and
germain
tried
to
discover
where
he
was
he
saw
that
he
was
lost
for
father
maurice
had
told
him
when
he
explained
the
way
that
on
leaving
the
wood
he
must
descend
a
very
steep
hillside
cross
a
wide
meadow
and
ford
the
river
twice
he
had
even
warned
him
to
cross
this
river
carefully
for
early
in
the
season
there
had
been
great
rains
and
the
water
might
still
be
higher
than
usual
seeing
neither
hillside
nor
meadows
nor
river
but
a
heath
level
and
white
as
a
mantle
of
snow
germain
stopped
looked
about
for
a
house
and
waited
for
a
passerby
but
could
find
nothing
to
set
him
right
then
he
retraced
his
steps
and
reentered
the
wood
but
the
mist
thickened
yet
more
the
moon
was
completely
hidden
the
roads
were
execrable
and
the
quagmires
deep
twice
the
gray
almost
fell
her
heavy
load
made
her
lose
courage
and
although
she
kept
enough
sagacity
to
avoid
the
treetrunks
she
could
not
prevent
her
riders
from
striking
the
great
branches
which
overhung
the
road
at
the
height
of
their
heads
and
caused
them
great
danger
in
one
of
these
collisions
germain
lost
his
hat
and
only
recovered
it
after
much
difficulty
petitpierre
had
fallen
asleep
and
lying
like
a
log
in
his
father
s
arms
hampered
him
so
that
he
could
no
longer
hold
up
nor
direct
the
horse
i
believe
we
are
bewitched
exclaimed
germain
stopping
for
the
wood
is
not
large
enough
to
get
lost
in
if
a
man
is
not
drunk
and
here
we
have
been
turning
round
and
round
for
two
hours
at
least
without
finding
a
way
out
the
gray
has
but
one
idea
in
her
head
and
that
is
to
get
home
it
is
she
who
is
deceiving
me
if
we
wish
to
go
home
we
have
only
to
give
her
the
bit
but
when
we
are
perhaps
but
two
steps
from
our
journey
s
end
it
would
be
foolish
to
give
up
and
return
such
a
long
road
and
yet
i
am
at
a
loss
what
to
do
i
can
t
see
sky
or
earth
and
i
am
afraid
that
the
child
will
catch
the
fever
if
we
remain
in
this
cursed
fog
or
that
he
will
be
crushed
beneath
our
weight
if
the
horse
falls
forward
we
must
not
persist
longer
said
little
marie
let
s
dismount
germain
give
me
the
child
i
can
carry
him
perfectly
well
and
i
know
better
than
you
how
to
keep
the
cloak
from
falling
open
and
leaving
him
exposed
you
lead
the
mare
by
her
bridle
perhaps
we
shall
see
more
clearly
when
we
are
nearer
the
ground
this
precaution
was
of
service
only
in
saving
them
from
a
fall
for
the
fog
hung
low
and
seemed
to
stick
to
the
damp
earth
their
advance
was
painfully
slow
and
they
were
soon
so
weary
that
they
halted
when
they
reached
a
dry
spot
beneath
the
great
oaks
little
marie
was
in
a
violent
sweat
but
she
uttered
not
a
word
of
complaint
nor
did
she
worry
about
anything
thinking
only
of
the
child
she
sat
down
on
the
sand
and
laid
it
upon
her
knees
while
germain
explored
the
neighborhood
after
having
fastened
the
gray
s
reins
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
but
the
gray
was
very
dissatisfied
with
the
journey
she
reared
suddenly
broke
the
reins
loose
burst
her
girths
and
giving
by
way
of
receipt
half
a
dozen
kicks
higher
than
her
head
she
started
across
the
clearing
showing
very
plainly
that
she
needed
no
one
to
show
her
the
way
home
well
here
we
are
afoot
said
germain
after
a
vain
attempt
to
catch
the
horse
and
it
would
do
us
no
good
now
if
we
were
on
the
good
road
for
we
should
have
to
ford
the
river
on
foot
and
since
these
paths
are
filled
with
water
we
may
be
sure
that
the
meadow
is
wholly
submerged
we
don
t
know
the
other
routes
we
must
wait
until
this
fog
clears
it
can
t
last
more
than
an
hour
or
two
as
soon
as
we
can
see
clearly
we
shall
look
about
for
a
house
the
first
we
come
to
near
the
edge
of
the
wood
but
for
the
present
we
can
t
stir
from
here
there
is
a
ditch
and
a
pond
over
there
heaven
knows
what
is
in
front
of
us
and
what
is
behind
us
is
more
than
i
can
say
now
for
i
have
forgotten
which
way
we
came
illustration
ornament
vii
underneath
the
big
oaks
well
we
must
be
patient
germain
said
little
marie
we
are
not
badly
off
on
this
little
hillock
the
rain
does
not
pierce
the
leaves
of
these
big
oaks
and
we
can
light
a
fire
for
i
can
feel
old
stumps
which
stir
readily
and
are
dry
enough
to
burn
you
have
a
light
germain
have
you
not
you
were
smoking
your
pipe
a
few
minutes
ago
i
did
have
my
tinderbox
was
in
my
bag
on
the
saddle
with
the
game
that
i
was
bringing
to
my
bride
that
is
to
be
but
that
devilish
mare
has
run
away
with
everything
even
with
my
cloak
which
she
will
lose
and
tear
to
bits
on
every
branch
she
comes
to
no
no
germain
saddle
and
cloak
and
bag
are
all
there
on
the
ground
at
your
feet
the
gray
burst
her
girths
and
threw
off
everything
as
she
ran
away
that
s
true
thank
god
exclaimed
the
laborer
if
we
can
grope
about
and
find
a
little
dead
wood
we
shall
be
able
to
dry
ourselves
and
get
warm
that
s
not
difficult
said
little
marie
dead
wood
always
cracks
when
you
step
on
it
but
will
you
give
me
the
saddle
what
do
you
want
of
it
to
make
a
bed
for
the
child
no
not
that
way
upside
down
he
will
not
roll
off
into
the
hollow
and
it
is
still
very
warm
from
the
horse
s
back
prop
it
up
all
around
with
the
stones
that
you
see
there
i
can
t
see
a
stone
you
must
have
cat
s
eyes
there
it
is
all
done
germain
hand
me
your
cloak
so
that
you
can
wrap
up
his
little
feet
and
throw
my
cape
over
his
body
just
see
if
he
is
not
as
comfortable
as
though
he
were
in
his
own
bed
and
feel
how
warm
he
is
you
certainly
know
how
to
take
care
of
children
marie
i
need
not
be
a
witch
to
do
that
now
get
your
tinderbox
from
your
bag
and
i
will
arrange
the
wood
this
wood
will
never
catch
fire
it
is
too
damp
you
are
always
doubting
germain
don
t
you
remember
when
you
were
a
shepherd
and
made
big
fires
in
the
fields
right
in
the
midst
of
the
rain
yes
that
is
a
knack
that
belongs
to
children
who
take
care
of
sheep
but
i
was
made
to
drive
the
oxen
as
soon
as
i
could
walk
that
is
what
has
made
your
arms
strong
and
your
hands
quick
here
the
fire
is
built
you
shall
see
whether
it
does
not
burn
give
me
the
light
and
a
handful
of
dry
ferns
that
is
all
right
now
blow
you
are
not
consumptive
are
you
not
that
i
know
of
said
germain
blowing
like
a
smith
s
bellows
in
an
instant
the
flame
leaped
up
and
throwing
out
a
red
glare
it
rose
finally
in
pale
blue
jets
under
the
oak
branches
battling
with
the
fog
and
gradually
drying
the
atmosphere
for
ten
feet
around
now
i
am
going
to
sit
by
the
child
so
that
the
sparks
may
not
fall
on
him
said
the
young
girl
pile
on
the
wood
and
stir
up
the
fire
germain
we
shall
not
catch
cold
nor
fever
here
i
will
answer
for
it
upon
my
word
you
are
a
clever
girl
said
germain
and
you
know
how
to
make
a
fire
like
a
little
fairy
of
the
night
i
feel
quite
revived
and
my
courage
has
come
back
again
for
with
my
legs
drenched
up
to
the
knees
and
with
the
thought
of
staying
this
way
till
daylight
i
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
just
now
and
when
people
are
in
a
bad
temper
they
don
t
think
of
anything
answered
little
marie
and
are
you
never
badtempered
no
never
what
is
the
good
of
it
oh
of
course
there
is
no
good
but
how
can
you
help
it
when
you
have
troubles
yet
heaven
knows
that
you
have
not
lacked
them
my
little
girl
for
you
have
not
always
been
happy
it
is
true
that
my
mother
and
i
have
suffered
we
have
had
sorrows
but
we
have
never
lost
heart
i
should
never
lose
heart
no
matter
how
hard
my
work
was
said
germain
but
poverty
would
make
me
very
sad
for
i
have
never
wanted
for
anything
my
wife
made
me
rich
and
i
am
rich
still
i
shall
be
so
as
long
as
i
work
on
the
farm
and
that
will
be
always
i
hope
but
everybody
must
suffer
his
share
i
have
suffered
in
another
way
yes
you
have
lost
your
wife
that
is
very
sad
isn
t
it
oh
germain
i
have
wept
for
her
many
a
time
she
was
so
very
kind
but
don
t
let
us
talk
about
her
longer
for
i
shall
burst
out
crying
all
my
troubles
are
ready
to
come
back
to
me
today
it
is
true
she
loved
you
dearly
little
marie
she
used
to
make
a
great
deal
of
you
and
your
mother
are
you
crying
come
my
girl
i
don
t
want
to
cry
but
you
are
crying
germain
you
are
crying
as
hard
as
i
why
should
a
man
be
ashamed
to
weep
for
his
wife
don
t
let
me
trouble
you
that
sorrow
is
mine
as
well
as
yours
you
have
a
kind
heart
marie
and
it
does
me
good
to
weep
with
you
put
your
feet
nearer
the
fire
your
skirts
are
all
soaked
too
poor
little
girl
i
am
going
to
take
your
place
by
the
boy
you
move
nearer
the
fire
i
am
hot
enough
said
marie
and
if
you
wish
to
sit
down
take
a
corner
of
the
cloak
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
the
truth
is
that
it
is
not
so
bad
here
said
germain
as
he
sat
down
beside
her
only
i
feel
very
hungry
again
it
is
almost
nine
o
clock
and
i
have
had
such
hard
work
in
walking
over
these
vile
roads
that
i
feel
quite
tired
out
are
you
not
hungry
too
little
marie
inot
at
all
i
am
not
accustomed
like
you
to
four
meals
a
day
and
i
have
been
to
bed
so
often
without
my
supper
that
once
more
does
not
trouble
me
a
woman
like
you
is
very
convenient
she
costs
nothing
said
germain
smiling
i
am
not
a
woman
exclaimed
marie
naïvely
without
perceiving
the
direction
the
husbandman
s
ideas
had
taken
are
you
dreaming
yes
i
believe
i
must
be
dreaming
answered
germain
perhaps
hunger
is
making
my
mind
wander
how
greedy
you
are
answered
she
brightening
in
her
turn
well
if
you
can
t
live
five
or
six
hours
without
eating
have
you
not
game
in
your
bag
and
fire
to
cook
it
by
jove
that
s
a
good
idea
but
how
about
the
present
to
my
future
fatherinlaw
you
have
six
partridges
and
a
hare
i
suppose
you
do
not
need
all
of
them
to
satisfy
your
appetite
but
how
can
we
cook
them
without
a
spit
or
andirons
they
will
be
burned
to
a
cinder
not
at
all
said
little
marie
i
warrant
that
i
can
cook
them
for
you
under
the
cinders
without
a
taste
of
smoke
have
you
never
caught
larks
in
the
fields
and
cooked
them
between
two
stones
oh
that
is
truei
keep
forgetting
that
you
have
never
been
a
shepherd
come
pluck
the
partridge
not
so
hard
you
will
tear
the
skin
you
might
be
plucking
the
other
to
show
me
how
then
you
wish
to
eat
two
what
an
ogre
you
are
they
are
all
plucked
i
am
going
to
cook
them
you
would
make
a
perfect
little
sutler
s
girl
marie
but
unhappily
you
have
no
canteen
and
i
shall
have
to
drink
water
from
this
pool
you
would
like
some
wine
would
you
not
possibly
you
might
prefer
coffee
you
imagine
yourself
under
the
trees
at
the
fair
call
out
the
host
some
wine
for
the
good
husbandman
of
belair
you
little
witch
you
are
making
fun
of
me
would
not
you
drink
some
wine
if
you
had
it
i
at
mother
rebec
s
with
you
tonight
i
drank
some
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
but
if
you
are
very
good
i
shall
give
you
a
bottle
almost
full
and
excellent
too
what
marie
i
verily
believe
you
are
a
witch
were
you
not
foolish
enough
to
ask
for
two
bottles
of
wine
at
the
inn
you
and
your
boy
drank
one
and
the
other
you
set
before
me
i
hardly
drank
three
drops
yet
you
paid
for
both
without
looking
what
then
why
i
put
the
full
one
in
my
basket
because
i
thought
that
you
or
your
child
would
be
thirsty
on
the
journey
and
here
it
is
you
are
the
most
thoughtful
girl
i
have
ever
met
although
the
poor
child
was
crying
when
we
left
the
inn
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
thinking
of
others
more
than
of
herself
little
marie
the
man
who
marries
you
will
be
no
fool
i
hope
not
for
i
am
not
fond
of
fools
come
eat
up
your
partridges
they
are
done
to
a
turn
and
for
want
of
bread
you
must
be
satisfied
with
chestnuts
where
the
deuce
did
you
find
chestnuts
too
it
is
extraordinary
all
along
the
road
i
picked
them
off
the
branches
as
we
went
along
and
filled
my
pockets
and
are
they
cooked
too
where
would
my
wits
have
been
had
i
not
had
sense
enough
to
put
the
chestnuts
in
the
fire
as
soon
as
it
was
lighted
that
is
the
way
we
always
do
in
the
fields
so
we
are
going
to
take
supper
together
little
marie
i
want
to
drink
your
health
and
wish
you
a
good
husband
just
the
sort
of
a
man
that
will
suit
you
tell
me
what
kind
you
want
i
should
find
that
very
difficult
germain
for
i
have
not
thought
about
it
yet
what
not
at
all
never
said
germain
as
he
began
to
eat
with
a
laborer
s
appetite
yet
stopping
to
cut
off
the
more
tender
morsels
for
his
companion
who
persisted
in
refusing
them
and
contented
herself
with
a
few
chestnuts
tell
me
little
marie
he
went
on
seeing
that
she
had
no
intention
of
answering
him
have
you
never
thought
of
marrying
yet
you
are
old
enough
perhaps
she
said
but
i
am
too
poor
i
need
at
least
a
hundred
crowns
to
marry
and
i
must
work
five
or
six
years
to
scrape
them
together
poor
girl
i
wish
father
maurice
were
willing
to
give
me
a
hundred
crowns
to
make
you
a
present
of
thank
you
kindly
germain
what
do
you
suppose
people
would
say
of
me
what
do
you
wish
them
to
say
of
you
they
know
very
well
that
i
am
too
old
to
marry
you
they
would
never
believe
that
ithat
you
look
germain
your
child
is
waking
up
said

viii
the
evening
prayer
petitpierre
had
raised
his
head
and
was
looking
about
him
with
a
thoughtful
air
oh
that
is
the
way
he
always
does
whenever
he
hears
the
sound
of
eating
said
germain
the
explosion
of
a
cannon
would
not
rouse
him
but
if
you
work
your
jaws
near
him
he
opens
his
eyes
at
once
you
must
have
been
just
like
him
at
his
age
said
little
marie
with
a
sly
smile
see
my
petitpierre
you
are
looking
for
your
canopy
tonight
it
is
made
all
of
green
my
child
but
your
father
eats
his
supper
none
the
less
do
you
wish
to
sup
with
him
i
have
not
eaten
your
share
i
thought
that
you
might
claim
it
marie
i
wish
you
to
eat
cried
the
husbandman
i
shall
not
touch
another
morsel
i
am
a
greedy
glutton
you
are
depriving
yourself
for
our
sake
it
is
not
fair
i
am
ashamed
it
takes
away
all
my
appetite
i
will
not
have
my
son
eat
his
supper
unless
you
take
some
too
leave
us
alone
said
little
marie
you
have
not
the
key
to
our
appetites
mine
is
tight
shut
today
but
your
pierre
s
is
as
wide
open
as
a
little
wolf
s
just
see
how
he
seizes
his
food
he
will
be
a
strong
workman
too
some
day
in
truth
petitpierre
showed
very
soon
whose
son
he
was
and
though
scarcely
awake
and
wholly
at
a
loss
to
know
where
he
was
and
how
he
had
come
there
he
began
to
eat
ravenously
as
soon
as
his
hunger
was
appeased
feeling
excited
as
children
do
who
break
loose
from
their
wonted
habits
he
had
more
wit
more
curiosity
and
more
good
sense
than
usual
he
made
them
explain
to
him
where
he
was
and
when
he
found
that
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
he
grew
a
little
frightened
are
there
wicked
beasts
in
this
forest
he
demanded
of
his
father
no
none
at
all
don
t
be
afraid
then
you
told
a
story
when
you
said
that
if
i
went
with
you
into
the
great
forest
the
wolves
would
carry
me
off
just
see
this
logician
said
germain
embarrassed
he
is
right
replied
little
marie
that
is
what
you
told
him
he
has
a
good
memory
and
has
not
forgotten
but
little
pierre
you
must
learn
that
your
father
never
tells
a
story
we
passed
through
the
big
forest
whilst
you
were
sleeping
and
now
we
are
in
the
small
forest
where
there
are
no
wicked
beasts
is
the
little
forest
very
far
away
from
the
big
one
far
enough
besides
the
wolves
never
go
out
of
the
big
forest
and
then
if
some
of
them
should
come
here
your
father
would
kill
them
and
you
too
little
marie
yes
we
too
for
you
would
help
also
my
pierre
you
are
not
frightened
are
you
you
would
beat
them
soundly
yes
indeed
i
would
said
the
child
proudly
as
he
struck
a
heroic
attitude
we
would
kill
them
there
is
nobody
like
you
for
talking
to
children
and
for
making
them
listen
to
reason
said
germain
to
little
marie
to
be
sure
it
is
not
long
ago
since
you
were
a
small
child
yourself
and
you
have
not
forgotten
what
your
mother
used
to
say
to
you
i
believe
that
the
younger
one
is
the
better
one
gets
on
with
children
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
a
woman
of
thirty
who
does
not
yet
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
would
find
it
hard
to
prattle
to
children
and
reason
with
them
why
germain
i
don
t
know
why
you
have
such
a
bad
idea
of
this
woman
you
will
change
your
mind
the
devil
take
the
woman
exclaimed
germain
i
wish
i
were
going
away
from
her
forever
what
do
i
want
of
a
wife
whom
i
don
t
know
little
father
said
the
child
why
is
it
that
you
speak
so
much
of
your
wife
today
since
she
is
dead
then
you
have
not
forgotten
your
poor
dear
mother
no
for
i
saw
her
placed
in
a
beautiful
box
of
white
wood
and
my
grandmother
led
me
up
to
her
to
kiss
her
and
say
goodby
she
was
very
white
and
very
stiff
and
every
evening
my
aunt
made
me
pray
god
that
she
might
go
to
him
in
heaven
and
be
warm
do
you
think
that
she
is
there
now
i
hope
so
my
child
but
you
must
always
pray
it
shows
your
mother
that
you
love
her
i
am
going
to
say
my
prayers
answered
the
boy
i
forgot
them
tonight
but
i
can
t
say
them
all
alone
for
i
always
forget
something
little
marie
must
help
me
yes
my
pierre
i
will
help
you
said
the
young
girl
come
and
kneel
down
in
my
lap
the
child
knelt
down
on
the
girl
s
skirt
he
clasped
his
little
hands
and
began
to
say
his
prayers
at
first
with
great
care
and
earnestness
for
he
knew
the
beginning
very
well
then
slowly
and
with
more
hesitation
and
finally
repeating
word
by
word
after
marie
when
he
came
to
that
place
in
his
prayer
where
sleep
overtook
him
so
invariably
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
learn
the
end
this
time
again
the
effort
of
close
attention
and
the
monotony
of
his
own
accent
produced
their
wonted
effect
he
pronounced
the
last
syllables
with
great
difficulty
and
only
after
they
were
thrice
repeated
his
head
grew
heavy
and
fell
on
marie
s
breast
his
hands
unclasped
divided
and
fell
open
on
his
knees
by
the
light
of
the
campfire
germain
watched
his
little
darling
hushed
at
the
heart
of
the
young
girl
who
as
she
held
him
in
her
arms
and
warmed
his
fair
hair
with
her
sweet
breath
had
herself
fallen
into
a
holy
reverie
and
prayed
in
quiet
for
the
soul
of
catherine
germain
was
touched
he
tried
to
express
to
little
marie
the
grateful
esteem
which
he
felt
for
her
but
he
could
find
no
fitting
words
he
approached
her
to
kiss
his
son
whom
she
held
close
to
her
breast
and
he
could
scarcely
raise
his
lips
from
little
pierre
s
brow
you
kiss
too
hard
said
marie
gently
pushing
away
the
husbandman
s
head
you
will
wake
him
let
me
put
him
back
to
bed
for
the
boy
has
left
us
already
for
dreams
of
paradise
the
child
allowed
marie
to
lay
him
down
but
feeling
the
goatskin
on
the
saddle
he
asked
if
he
were
on
the
gray
then
opening
his
big
blue
eyes
and
keeping
them
fixed
on
the
branches
for
a
minute
he
seemed
to
be
dreaming
wideawake
as
he
was
or
to
be
struck
with
an
idea
which
had
slipped
his
mind
during
the
daytime
and
only
assumed
a
distinct
form
at
the
approach
of
sleep
little
father
said
he
if
you
wish
to
give
me
a
new
mother
i
hope
it
will
be
little
marie
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
closed
his
eyes
and
slept
illustration
ornament
ix
despite
the
cold
little
marie
seemed
to
give
no
more
heed
to
the
child
s
odd
words
than
to
regard
them
as
a
proof
of
friendship
she
wrapped
him
up
with
care
stirred
the
fire
and
as
the
fog
resting
on
the
neighboring
pool
gave
no
sign
of
lifting
she
advised
germain
to
lie
near
the
fire
and
take
a
nap
i
see
that
you
are
sleepy
already
said
she
for
you
don
t
say
a
word
and
you
gaze
into
the
fire
just
as
your
little
boy
was
doing
it
is
you
who
must
sleep
answered
the
husbandman
and
i
will
take
care
of
both
of
you
for
i
have
never
felt
less
sleepy
than
i
do
now
i
have
fifty
things
to
think
of
fifty
is
a
great
many
said
the
little
girl
with
a
mocking
accent
there
are
lots
of
people
who
would
be
delighted
to
have
one
well
if
i
am
too
stupid
to
have
fifty
i
have
one
at
least
which
has
not
left
me
for
the
past
hour
and
i
shall
tell
it
to
you
as
well
as
i
told
you
those
you
thought
of
before
yes
do
tell
me
if
you
know
marie
tell
me
yourself
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
an
hour
ago
she
answered
your
idea
was
to
eatand
now
it
is
to
sleep
marie
i
am
only
an
oxdriver
but
upon
my
word
you
take
me
for
an
ox
you
are
very
perverse
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
do
not
care
to
talk
to
me
so
go
to
sleep
that
will
be
better
than
to
pick
flaws
in
a
man
who
is
out
of
sorts
if
you
wish
to
talk
let
s
talk
said
the
girl
half
reclining
near
the
child
and
resting
her
head
against
the
saddle
you
torment
yourself
germain
and
you
do
not
show
much
courage
for
a
man
what
wouldn
t
i
say
if
i
didn
t
do
my
best
to
fight
my
own
troubles
yes
that
s
very
true
and
that
s
just
what
i
am
thinking
of
my
poor
child
you
are
going
to
live
away
from
your
friends
in
a
horrid
country
full
of
moors
and
fens
where
you
will
catch
the
autumn
fevers
sheep
do
not
pay
well
there
and
this
is
always
discouraging
for
a
shepherdess
if
she
means
well
then
you
will
be
surrounded
by
strangers
who
may
not
be
kind
to
you
and
will
not
know
how
much
you
are
worth
it
makes
me
more
sorry
than
i
can
tell
you
and
i
have
a
great
desire
to
take
you
home
to
your
mother
instead
of
going
on
to
fourche
you
talk
very
kindly
but
there
is
no
reason
for
your
misgivings
my
poor
germain
you
ought
not
to
lose
heart
on
your
friend
s
account
and
instead
of
showing
me
the
dark
side
of
my
lot
you
should
show
me
the
bright
side
as
you
did
after
lunch
at
rebec
s
what
can
i
do
that
s
the
way
it
appeared
to
me
then
and
now
my
ideas
are
changed
it
is
best
for
you
to
take
a
husband
that
cannot
be
germain
and
as
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
think
no
more
about
it
yet
such
a
thing
might
happen
perhaps
if
you
told
me
what
kind
of
a
man
you
want
i
might
imagine
somebody
imagining
is
not
finding
for
myself
i
never
imagine
for
it
does
no
good
you
are
not
looking
for
a
rich
man
certainly
not
for
i
am
as
poor
as
job
but
if
he
were
comfortably
off
you
wouldn
t
be
sorry
to
have
a
good
house
and
good
food
and
good
clothes
and
to
live
with
an
honest
family
who
would
allow
you
to
help
your
mother
oh
yes
indeed
it
is
my
own
wish
to
help
my
mother
and
if
this
man
were
to
turn
up
you
would
not
be
too
hard
to
please
even
if
he
were
not
so
very
young
ah
there
you
must
excuse
me
germain
that
is
just
the
point
i
insist
on
i
could
never
love
an
old
man
an
old
man
of
course
not
but
a
man
of
my
age
for
example
your
age
is
too
old
for
me
germain
i
should
like
bastien
s
age
though
bastien
is
not
so
goodlooking
as
you
should
you
rather
have
bastien
the
swineherd
said
germain
indignantly
a
fellow
with
eyes
shaped
like
those
of
the
pigs
he
drives
i
could
excuse
his
eyes
because
he
is
eighteen
germain
felt
terribly
jealous
well
said
he
it
s
clear
that
you
want
bastien
but
none
the
less
it
s
a
queer
idea
yes
that
would
be
a
queer
idea
answered
little
marie
bursting
into
shouts
of
laughter
and
he
would
make
a
queer
husband
you
could
gull
him
to
your
heart
s
content
for
instance
the
other
day
i
had
picked
up
a
tomato
in
the
curate
s
garden
i
told
him
that
it
was
a
fine
red
apple
and
he
bit
into
it
like
a
glutton
if
you
had
only
seen
what
a
face
he
made
heavens
how
ugly
he
was
then
you
don
t
love
him
since
you
are
making
fun
of
him
that
wouldn
t
be
a
reason
but
i
don
t
like
him
he
is
unkind
to
his
little
sister
and
he
is
dirty
don
t
you
care
for
anybody
else
how
does
that
concern
you
germain
not
at
all
except
that
it
gives
me
something
to
talk
about
i
see
very
well
little
girl
that
you
have
a
sweetheart
in
your
mind
already
no
germain
you
re
wrong
i
have
no
sweetheart
yet
perhaps
one
may
come
later
but
since
i
cannot
marry
until
i
have
something
laid
by
i
am
destined
to
marry
late
in
life
and
with
an
old
man
then
take
an
old
man
without
delay
no
when
i
am
no
longer
young
i
shall
not
care
for
the
present
it
is
different
i
see
that
i
displease
you
marie
that
s
clear
enough
said
germain
impatiently
and
without
stopping
to
weigh
his
words
little
marie
did
not
answer
germain
bent
over
her
she
was
sleeping
she
had
fallen
back
overcome
stricken
down
as
it
were
by
slumber
as
children
are
who
sleep
before
they
cease
to
babble
germain
was
glad
that
she
had
not
caught
his
last
words
he
felt
that
they
were
unwise
and
he
turned
his
back
to
distract
his
attention
and
change
his
thoughts
it
was
all
in
vain
he
could
neither
sleep
nor
think
of
anything
except
the
words
he
had
just
spoken
he
walked
about
the
fire
twenty
times
he
moved
away
he
came
back
at
last
feeling
himself
tremble
as
though
he
had
swallowed
gunpowder
he
leaned
against
the
tree
which
sheltered
the
two
children
and
watched
them
as
they
slept
i
know
not
how
it
is
thought
he
i
have
never
noticed
that
little
marie
is
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
countryside
she
has
not
much
color
but
her
little
face
is
fresh
as
a
wild
rose
what
a
charming
mouth
she
has
and
how
pretty
her
little
nose
is
she
is
not
large
for
her
age
but
she
is
formed
like
a
little
quail
and
is
as
light
as
a
bird
i
cannot
understand
why
they
made
so
much
fuss
at
home
over
a
big
fat
woman
with
a
bright
red
face
my
wife
was
rather
slender
and
pale
and
she
pleased
me
more
than
any
one
else
this
girl
is
very
frail
but
she
is
healthy
and
she
is
pretty
to
watch
as
a
white
kid
and
then
she
has
such
a
gentle
frank
expression
you
can
read
her
good
heart
in
her
eyes
even
though
they
are
closed
in
sleep
as
to
wit
i
must
confess
she
has
more
than
ever
my
dear
catherine
had
and
she
would
never
become
wearisome
she
is
gay
wise
industrious
loving
and
she
is
amusing
i
don
t
know
what
more
i
could
wish
for
but
what
is
the
use
of
thinking
of
all
this
germain
went
on
trying
to
look
in
another
direction
my
fatherinlaw
would
not
hear
of
it
and
all
the
family
would
think
me
mad
besides
she
would
not
have
me
herself
poor
child
she
thinks
me
too
old
she
told
me
so
she
is
unselfish
and
does
not
mind
poverty
and
worry
wearing
old
clothes
and
suffering
from
hunger
for
two
or
three
months
every
year
so
long
as
she
can
satisfy
her
heart
some
day
and
give
herself
to
the
man
she
loves
she
is
right
i
should
do
the
same
in
her
place
and
even
now
if
i
had
my
own
way
instead
of
marrying
a
wife
whom
i
don
t
care
for
i
would
choose
a
girl
after
my
own
heart
the
more
germain
tried
to
compose
himself
by
reasoning
the
further
he
was
from
succeeding
he
walked
away
a
dozen
steps
to
lose
himself
in
the
fog
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
found
himself
on
his
knees
beside
the
two
sleeping
children
once
he
wished
to
kiss
petitpierre
who
had
one
arm
about
marie
s
neck
and
made
such
a
mistake
that
marie
felt
a
breath
hot
as
fire
cross
her
lips
and
awaking
looked
about
her
with
a
bewildered
expression
totally
ignorant
of
all
that
was
passing
within
his
mind
i
didn
t
see
you
my
poor
children
said
germain
retreating
rapidly
i
almost
stumbled
over
you
and
hurt
you
little
marie
was
so
innocent
that
she
believed
him
and
fell
asleep
again
germain
walked
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
and
swore
to
god
that
he
would
not
stir
until
she
had
waked
he
kept
his
word
but
not
without
a
struggle
he
thought
that
he
would
go
mad
at
length
toward
midnight
the
fog
lifted
and
germain
could
see
the
stars
shining
through
the
trees
the
moon
freed
herself
from
the
mist
which
had
hidden
her
and
began
to
sow
her
diamonds
over
the
damp
moss
the
trunks
of
the
oaktrees
remained
in
impressive
darkness
but
beyond
the
white
branches
of
the
birchtrees
seemed
a
long
line
of
phantoms
in
their
shrouds
the
fire
cast
its
reflection
in
the
pool
and
the
frogs
growing
accustomed
to
the
light
hazarded
a
few
shrill
and
uneasy
notes
the
rugged
branches
of
the
old
trees
bristling
with
dimcolored
lichens
crossed
and
intertwined
themselves
like
great
gaunt
arms
above
the
travelers
heads
it
was
a
lovely
spot
but
so
lonely
and
so
sad
that
germain
unable
to
endure
it
more
began
to
sing
and
throw
stones
into
the
water
to
forget
the
dread
weariness
of
solitude
he
was
anxious
also
to
wake
little
marie
and
when
he
saw
her
rise
and
look
about
at
the
weather
he
proposed
that
they
start
on
their
journey
in
two
hours
said
he
the
approach
of
morning
will
chill
the
air
so
that
we
can
t
stay
here
in
spite
of
our
fire
now
we
can
see
our
way
and
we
shall
soon
find
a
house
which
will
open
its
doors
to
us
or
at
least
a
barn
where
we
can
pass
the
rest
of
the
night
under
shelter
marie
had
no
will
of
her
own
and
although
she
was
longing
to
sleep
she
made
ready
to
follow
germain
the
husbandman
took
his
boy
in
his
arms
without
awaking
him
and
beckoned
marie
to
come
nearer
in
order
to
cover
her
with
his
cloak
for
she
would
not
take
her
own
mantle
which
was
wrapped
about
the
child
when
he
felt
the
young
girl
so
close
to
him
germain
who
for
a
time
had
succeeded
in
distracting
his
mind
and
raising
his
spirits
began
to
lose
his
head
once
more
two
or
three
times
he
strode
ahead
abruptly
leaving
her
to
walk
alone
then
seeing
how
hard
it
was
for
her
to
follow
he
waited
drew
her
quickly
to
his
side
and
pressed
her
so
tight
that
she
was
surprised
and
even
angry
though
she
dared
not
say
so
as
they
knew
not
the
direction
whence
they
had
come
they
had
no
idea
of
that
in
which
they
were
going
so
they
crossed
the
wood
once
more
and
found
themselves
afresh
before
the
lonely
moor
then
they
retraced
their
steps
and
after
much
turning
and
twisting
they
spied
a
light
across
the
branches
good
enough
here
s
a
house
exclaimed
germain
and
the
people
are
already
astir
for
the
fire
is
lighted
it
must
be
very
late
it
was
no
house
but
the
campfire
which
they
had
covered
before
they
left
and
which
had
sprung
up
in
the
breeze
they
had
tramped
for
two
hours
only
to
find
themselves
at
the
very
place
from
which
they
had
started
illustration
ornament
x
beneath
the
stars
this
time
i
give
up
said
germain
stamping
his
foot
we
are
bewitched
that
is
certain
and
we
shall
not
get
away
from
here
before
broad
day
the
devil
is
in
this
place
well
it
s
of
no
use
to
get
angry
said
marie
we
must
take
what
is
given
us
let
us
make
a
big
fire
the
child
is
so
well
wrapped
up
that
he
is
in
no
danger
and
we
shall
not
die
from
a
single
night
out
of
doors
where
have
you
hidden
the
saddle
germain
right
in
the
midst
of
the
hollybusheswhat
a
goose
you
are
it
s
very
convenient
to
get
it
from
there
stop
child
hold
the
boy
while
i
pull
his
bed
from
the
thorns
i
didn
t
want
you
to
scratch
your
hands
it
s
all
done
here
s
the
bed
and
a
few
scratches
are
not
sabercuts
replied
the
brave
girl
she
proceeded
to
put
the
child
to
bed
again
and
petitpierre
was
so
sound
asleep
this
time
that
he
knew
nothing
of
his
last
journey
germain
piled
so
much
wood
on
the
fire
that
the
forest
all
about
glowed
with
the
light
little
marie
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
powers
and
although
she
did
not
complain
her
legs
would
support
her
no
longer
she
was
white
and
her
teeth
chattered
with
cold
and
weakness
germain
took
her
in
his
arms
to
warm
her
the
uneasiness
the
compassion
the
tenderness
of
movement
he
could
not
repress
took
possession
of
his
heart
and
stilled
his
senses
as
by
a
miracle
his
tongue
was
loosened
and
every
feeling
of
shame
vanished
marie
said
he
i
like
you
and
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
don
t
like
me
if
you
would
take
me
for
your
husband
there
are
no
fathers
nor
family
nor
neighbors
nor
arguments
which
could
prevent
me
from
giving
myself
to
you
i
know
how
happy
you
would
make
my
children
and
that
you
would
teach
them
to
love
the
memory
of
their
mother
and
with
a
quiet
conscience
i
could
satisfy
the
wishes
of
my
heart
i
have
always
been
fond
of
you
and
now
i
love
you
so
well
that
were
you
to
ask
me
to
spend
all
my
life
in
doing
your
pleasure
i
would
swear
to
do
it
on
the
instant
please
think
how
much
i
love
you
and
try
to
forget
my
age
think
that
it
is
a
wrong
notion
to
believe
that
a
man
of
thirty
is
old
besides
i
am
but
twentyeight
a
young
girl
is
afraid
that
people
will
talk
about
her
if
she
takes
a
man
ten
or
twelve
years
older
than
she
simply
because
that
is
not
the
custom
in
our
country
but
i
have
heard
say
that
in
other
countries
people
don
t
look
at
it
in
this
light
and
that
they
had
rather
allow
a
sensible
man
of
approved
courage
to
support
a
young
girl
than
trust
her
to
a
mere
boy
who
may
go
astray
and
from
the
honest
fellow
they
thought
him
turn
into
a
goodfornothing
and
then
years
don
t
always
make
age
that
depends
on
the
health
and
strength
a
person
has
when
a
man
is
used
up
by
overwork
and
poverty
or
by
a
bad
life
he
is
old
before
twentyfive
while
ibut
marie
you
are
not
listening
yes
i
am
germain
i
hear
you
perfectly
answered
little
marie
but
i
am
thinking
over
what
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
so
often
that
a
woman
of
sixty
is
to
be
pitied
greatly
when
her
husband
is
seventy
or
seventyfive
and
can
no
longer
work
to
support
her
he
grows
feeble
and
it
becomes
her
duty
to
nurse
him
at
the
very
age
when
she
begins
to
feel
great
need
of
care
and
rest
herself
and
so
it
is
that
the
end
comes
in
a
garret
parents
do
well
to
say
so
i
admit
answered
germain
but
then
they
would
sacrifice
all
their
youth
the
best
years
of
their
life
to
calculating
what
will
become
of
them
at
the
age
when
a
person
is
no
longer
good
for
anything
and
when
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
which
way
death
comes
but
i
am
in
no
danger
of
starving
in
my
old
age
i
am
even
going
to
lay
by
something
since
i
live
with
my
wife
s
parents
and
spend
nothing
and
then
you
see
i
shall
love
you
so
well
that
i
can
never
grow
old
they
say
that
when
a
man
is
happy
he
keeps
sound
and
i
know
well
that
in
love
for
you
i
am
younger
than
bastien
for
he
does
not
love
you
he
is
too
stupid
too
much
of
a
child
to
understand
how
pretty
and
how
good
you
are
and
how
you
were
made
for
people
to
court
do
not
hate
me
marie
i
am
not
a
bad
man
i
made
my
catherine
happy
and
on
her
deathbed
she
swore
before
god
that
she
had
had
only
happiness
of
me
and
she
asked
me
to
marry
again
her
spirit
must
have
spoken
to
her
child
tonight
did
you
not
hear
the
words
he
said
how
his
little
lips
quivered
as
his
eyes
stared
upward
watching
something
that
we
could
not
see
he
was
surely
looking
at
his
mother
and
it
was
she
who
made
him
say
that
he
wished
you
to
take
her
place
germain
answered
marie
amazed
and
yet
thoughtful
you
speak
frankly
and
everything
that
you
say
is
true
i
am
sure
that
i
should
do
well
to
love
you
if
it
did
not
displease
your
parents
too
much
but
what
can
i
do
my
heart
does
not
speak
for
you
i
am
very
fond
of
you
but
though
your
age
does
not
make
you
ugly
it
makes
me
afraid
it
seems
as
if
you
were
some
such
relation
to
me
as
an
uncle
or
a
godfather
that
i
must
be
respectful
toward
you
and
that
there
might
be
moments
when
you
would
treat
me
like
a
little
girl
rather
than
like
your
wife
and
your
equal
and
perhaps
my
friends
would
make
fun
of
me
and
although
it
would
be
silly
to
give
heed
to
that
i
think
that
i
should
be
a
little
sad
on
my
weddingday
those
are
but
childish
reasons
marie
you
speak
like
a
child
yes
that
is
true
i
am
a
child
said
she
and
it
is
on
that
account
i
am
afraid
of
too
sensible
a
man
you
must
see
that
i
am
too
young
for
you
since
you
just
found
fault
with
me
for
speaking
foolishly
i
can
t
have
more
sense
than
my
age
allows
o
heavens
how
unlucky
i
am
to
be
so
clumsy
and
to
express
so
ill
what
i
think
cried
germain
marie
you
don
t
love
me
that
is
the
long
and
short
of
it
you
find
me
too
simple
and
too
dull
if
you
loved
me
at
all
you
would
not
see
my
faults
so
clearly
but
you
do
not
love
me
that
is
the
whole
story
that
is
not
my
fault
answered
she
a
little
hurt
that
he
was
speaking
with
less
tenderness
i
am
doing
my
best
to
hear
you
but
the
more
i
try
the
less
i
can
get
it
into
my
head
that
we
ought
to
be
husband
and
wife
germain
did
not
answer
his
head
dropped
into
his
hands
and
little
marie
could
not
tell
whether
he
wept
or
sulked
or
was
fast
asleep
she
felt
uneasy
when
she
saw
him
so
cast
down
and
could
not
guess
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
but
she
dared
not
speak
to
him
more
and
as
she
was
too
astonished
at
what
had
passed
to
have
any
desire
to
sleep
she
waited
impatiently
for
dawn
tending
the
fire
with
care
and
watching
over
the
child
whose
existence
germain
appeared
to
forget
yet
germain
was
not
asleep
he
did
not
mope
over
his
lot
he
made
no
plans
to
encourage
himself
nor
schemes
to
entrap
the
girl
he
suffered
he
felt
a
great
weight
of
grief
at
his
heart
he
wished
that
he
were
dead
the
world
seemed
to
turn
against
him
and
if
he
could
have
wept
at
all
his
tears
would
have
come
in
floods
but
mingled
with
his
sorrow
there
was
a
feeling
of
anger
against
himself
and
he
felt
choked
without
the
power
or
the
wish
to
complain
when
morning
came
and
the
sounds
of
the
country
brought
it
to
germain
s
senses
he
lifted
his
head
from
his
hands
and
rose
he
saw
that
little
marie
had
slept
no
more
than
he
but
he
knew
no
words
in
which
to
tell
her
of
his
anxiety
he
was
very
discouraged
hiding
the
gray
s
saddle
once
more
in
the
thicket
he
slung
his
sack
over
his
shoulder
and
took
his
son
by
the
hand
now
marie
said
he
we
are
going
to
try
to
end
our
journey
do
you
wish
me
to
take
you
to
ormeaux
let
us
leave
the
woods
together
answered
she
and
when
we
know
where
we
are
we
shall
separate
and
go
our
different
ways
germain
did
not
answer
he
felt
hurt
that
the
girl
did
not
ask
him
to
take
her
as
far
as
ormeaux
and
he
did
not
notice
that
he
had
asked
her
in
a
tone
well
fitted
to
provoke
a
refusal
after
a
few
hundred
steps
they
met
a
woodcutter
who
pointed
out
the
highroad
and
told
them
that
when
they
had
crossed
the
plain
one
must
turn
to
the
right
the
other
to
the
left
to
gain
their
different
destinations
which
were
so
near
together
that
the
houses
of
fourche
were
in
plain
sight
from
the
farm
of
ormeaux
and
vice
versa
when
they
had
thanked
him
and
passed
on
the
woodcutter
called
them
back
to
ask
whether
they
had
not
lost
a
horse
yes
he
said
i
found
a
pretty
gray
mare
in
my
yard
where
perhaps
a
wolf
had
driven
her
to
seek
refuge
my
dogs
barked
the
whole
night
long
and
at
daybreak
i
saw
the
mare
under
my
shed
she
is
there
now
come
along
with
me
and
if
you
recognize
her
you
may
take
her
when
germain
had
given
a
description
of
the
gray
and
felt
convinced
that
it
was
really
she
he
started
back
to
find
his
saddle
little
marie
offered
to
take
his
child
to
ormeaux
whither
he
might
go
to
get
him
after
he
had
introduced
himself
at
fourche
he
is
rather
dirty
after
the
night
that
we
have
passed
said
she
i
will
brush
his
clothes
wash
his
pretty
face
and
comb
his
hair
and
when
he
looks
neat
and
clean
you
can
present
him
to
your
new
family
who
told
you
that
i
wish
to
go
to
fourche
answered
germain
petulantly
perhaps
i
shall
not
go
but
truly
germain
it
is
your
duty
to
go
there
you
will
go
there
replied
the
girl
you
seem
very
anxious
to
have
me
married
off
so
that
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
i
shall
not
trouble
you
again
germain
you
must
not
think
of
that
any
more
it
is
an
idea
which
came
to
you
in
the
night
because
this
unfortunate
mishap
took
away
your
spirits
but
now
you
must
come
to
your
senses
i
promise
you
to
forget
everything
that
you
said
to
me
and
not
to
breathe
it
to
a
soul
oh
say
what
you
wish
it
is
not
my
custom
to
deny
what
i
have
spoken
what
i
told
you
was
true
and
honest
and
i
shall
not
blush
for
it
before
anybody
yes
but
if
your
wife
were
to
know
that
just
before
you
came
you
were
thinking
of
another
woman
it
would
prejudice
her
against
you
so
take
care
how
you
speak
now
don
t
look
at
me
before
everybody
with
such
a
rapt
expression
think
of
father
maurice
who
relies
on
your
obedience
and
who
would
be
enraged
at
me
if
i
were
to
turn
you
from
his
will
goodby
germain
i
take
petitpierre
in
order
to
force
you
to
go
to
fourche
he
is
a
pledge
which
i
keep
on
your
behalf
so
you
want
to
go
with
her
said
the
husbandman
to
his
son
seeing
that
the
boy
had
clasped
marie
s
hands
and
was
following
her
resolutely
yes
father
answered
the
child
who
had
heard
the
conversation
and
understood
after
his
own
fashion
the
words
spoken
so
unguardedly
before
him
i
am
going
away
with
my
dearest
little
marie
you
shall
come
to
find
me
when
you
have
done
marrying
but
i
wish
marie
to
be
my
little
mother
you
see
how
much
he
wishes
it
said
germain
to
the
girl
listen
to
me
petitpierre
he
added
i
wish
her
to
be
your
mother
and
to
stay
with
you
always
it
is
she
who
does
not
wish
to
try
to
make
her
grant
you
what
she
has
denied
me
don
t
be
afraid
father
i
shall
make
her
say
yes
little
marie
does
everything
that
i
wish
he
walked
away
with
the
young
girl
germain
stood
alone
sadder
and
more
irresolute
than
ever
illustration
ornament
xi
the
belle
of
the
village
and
after
all
when
he
had
brushed
the
dust
of
travel
from
his
clothes
and
from
his
horse
s
harness
when
he
had
mounted
the
gray
and
when
he
had
learned
the
road
he
felt
that
there
was
no
retreat
and
that
he
must
forget
that
anxious
night
as
though
it
had
been
a
dangerous
dream
he
found
father
leonard
seated
on
a
trim
bench
of
spinachgreen
the
six
stone
steps
leading
up
to
the
door
showed
that
the
house
had
a
cellar
the
walls
of
the
garden
and
of
the
hempfield
were
plastered
with
lime
and
sand
it
was
a
handsome
house
and
might
almost
have
been
mistaken
for
the
dwelling
of
a
bourgeois
germain
s
future
fatherinlaw
came
forward
to
meet
him
and
having
plied
him
for
five
minutes
with
questions
concerning
his
entire
family
he
added
that
conventional
phrase
with
which
one
passerby
addresses
another
concerning
the
object
of
his
journey
so
you
are
taking
a
little
trip
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
have
come
to
see
you
replied
the
husbandman
to
give
you
this
little
present
of
game
with
my
father
s
compliments
and
to
tell
you
from
him
that
you
ought
to
know
with
what
intentions
i
come
to
your
house
oh
ho
said
father
leonard
laughing
and
tapping
his
capacious
stomach
i
see
i
understand
i
am
with
you
and
he
added
with
a
wink
you
will
not
be
the
only
one
to
pay
your
court
young
man
there
are
three
already
in
the
house
dancing
attendance
like
you
i
never
turn
anybody
away
and
i
should
find
it
hard
to
say
yes
or
no
to
any
of
them
for
they
are
all
good
matches
yet
on
account
of
father
maurice
and
for
the
sake
of
the
rich
fields
you
till
i
hope
that
it
may
be
you
but
my
daughter
is
of
age
and
mistress
of
her
own
affairs
she
will
do
as
she
likes
go
in
and
introduce
yourself
i
hope
that
you
will
draw
the
prize
i
beg
your
pardon
answered
germain
amazed
to
find
himself
an
extra
when
he
had
counted
on
being
alone
in
the
field
i
was
not
aware
that
your
daughter
was
supplied
already
with
suitors
and
i
did
not
come
to
quarrel
over
her
if
you
supposed
that
because
you
were
slow
in
coming
my
daughter
would
be
left
unprovided
for
you
were
greatly
mistaken
my
son
replied
father
leonard
with
unshaken
good
humor
catherine
has
the
wherewithal
to
attract
suitors
and
her
only
difficulty
lies
in
choosing
but
come
in
don
t
lose
heart
the
woman
is
worth
a
struggle
and
pushing
in
germain
by
the
shoulders
with
boisterous
gaiety
he
called
to
his
daughter
as
they
entered
the
house
so
catherine
here
is
another
this
cordial
but
unmannerly
method
of
introduction
to
the
widow
in
the
presence
of
her
other
devotees
completed
germain
s
distress
and
embarrassment
he
felt
the
awkwardness
of
his
position
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
without
daring
to
look
upon
the
beauty
and
her
court
the
widow
guérin
had
a
good
figure
and
did
not
lack
freshness
but
her
expression
and
her
dress
displeased
germain
the
instant
he
saw
her
she
had
a
bold
selfsatisfied
look
and
her
cap
edged
with
three
lace
flounces
her
silk
apron
and
her
fichu
of
fine
black
lace
were
little
in
accord
with
the
staid
and
sober
widow
he
had
pictured
to
himself
her
elaborate
dress
and
forward
manners
inclined
germain
to
judge
the
widow
old
and
ugly
although
she
was
certainly
not
either
he
thought
that
such
finery
and
playful
manners
might
well
suit
little
marie
s
years
and
wit
but
that
the
widow
s
fun
was
labored
and
over
bold
and
that
she
wore
her
fine
clothes
in
bad
taste
the
three
suitors
were
seated
at
a
table
loaded
with
wines
and
meats
which
were
spread
out
for
their
use
throughout
the
sunday
morning
for
father
leonard
liked
to
show
off
his
wealth
and
the
widow
was
not
sorry
to
display
her
pretty
china
and
keep
a
table
like
a
rich
lady
germain
simple
and
unsuspecting
as
he
was
watched
everything
with
a
penetrating
glance
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
kept
on
the
defensive
when
he
drank
father
leonard
obliged
him
to
sit
down
with
his
rivals
and
taking
a
chair
opposite
he
treated
him
with
great
politeness
and
talked
to
him
rather
than
to
the
others
the
present
of
game
despite
the
breach
germain
had
made
on
his
own
account
was
still
plenteous
enough
to
produce
its
effect
the
widow
did
not
look
unaware
of
its
presence
and
the
suitors
cast
disdainful
glances
in
its
direction
germain
felt
ill
at
ease
in
this
company
and
did
not
eat
heartily
father
leonard
poked
fun
at
him
you
look
very
melancholy
said
he
and
you
are
illusing
your
glass
you
must
not
allow
love
to
spoil
your
appetite
for
a
fasting
lover
can
make
no
such
pretty
speeches
as
he
whose
ideas
are
brightened
with
a
drop
of
wine
germain
was
mortified
at
being
thought
already
in
love
and
the
artificial
manner
of
the
widow
who
kept
lowering
her
eyes
with
a
smile
as
a
woman
does
who
is
sure
of
her
calculations
made
him
long
to
protest
against
his
pretended
surrender
but
fearing
to
appear
uncivil
he
smiled
and
held
his
peace
he
thought
the
widow
s
beaus
three
bumpkins
they
must
have
been
rich
for
her
to
admit
of
their
pretensions
one
was
over
forty
and
fat
as
father
leonard
another
had
lost
an
eye
and
drank
like
a
sot
the
third
was
a
young
fellow
and
nicelooking
too
but
he
kept
insisting
on
displaying
his
wit
and
would
say
things
so
silly
that
they
were
painful
to
hear
yet
the
widow
laughed
as
though
she
admired
all
his
foolishness
and
made
small
proof
of
her
good
taste
thereby
at
first
germain
thought
her
infatuated
with
him
but
soon
he
perceived
that
he
himself
was
especially
encouraged
and
that
they
wished
him
to
make
fresh
advances
for
this
reason
he
felt
an
increasing
stiffness
and
severity
which
he
took
no
pains
to
conceal
the
time
came
for
mass
and
they
rose
from
table
to
go
thither
in
company
it
was
necessary
to
walk
as
far
as
mers
a
good
halfleague
away
and
germain
was
so
tired
that
he
longed
to
take
a
nap
before
they
went
but
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
missing
mass
and
he
started
with
the
others
the
roads
were
filled
with
people
and
the
widow
marched
proudly
along
escorted
by
her
three
suitors
taking
an
arm
first
of
one
and
then
of
another
and
carrying
her
head
high
with
an
air
of
importance
she
was
eager
to
display
the
fourth
to
the
eyes
of
the
passersby
but
germain
felt
so
ridiculous
to
be
dragged
along
in
the
train
of
a
petticoat
where
all
the
world
might
see
that
he
kept
at
a
respectable
distance
chatting
with
father
leonard
and
succeeded
in
occupying
his
attention
so
well
that
they
did
not
look
at
all
as
if
they
belonged
to
the
party
illustration
ornament
xii
the
master
when
they
reached
the
village
the
widow
halted
to
allow
them
to
catch
up
she
was
bent
upon
making
her
entry
with
all
her
train
but
germain
denying
her
this
pleasure
deserted
father
leonard
and
after
conversing
with
several
acquaintances
he
entered
the
church
by
another
door
the
widow
was
vexed
when
mass
was
over
she
made
her
appearance
in
triumph
on
the
lawn
where
dancing
was
going
on
and
she
began
her
dance
with
her
three
lovers
in
turn
germain
watched
her
and
saw
that
she
danced
well
but
with
affectation
so
you
don
t
ask
my
daughter
said
leonard
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
you
are
too
easily
frightened
i
have
not
danced
since
i
lost
my
wife
answered
the
husbandman
but
now
that
you
are
looking
for
another
mourning
s
over
in
heart
as
well
as
in
clothes
that
s
no
reason
father
leonard
besides
i
am
too
old
and
i
don
t
care
for
dancing
listen
said
father
leonard
drawing
him
toward
a
retired
corner
when
you
entered
my
house
you
were
vexed
to
see
the
place
already
besieged
and
i
see
that
you
are
very
proud
but
that
is
not
reasonable
my
boy
my
daughter
is
used
to
a
great
deal
of
attention
particularly
since
she
left
off
her
mourning
two
years
ago
and
it
is
not
her
place
to
lead
you
on
has
your
daughter
been
thinking
of
marrying
for
two
years
already
without
making
her
choice
asked
germain
she
doesn
t
wish
to
hurry
and
she
is
right
although
she
has
lively
manners
and
although
you
may
not
think
that
she
reflects
a
great
deal
she
is
a
woman
of
excellent
common
sense
and
knows
very
well
what
she
is
about
it
does
not
appear
to
me
so
said
germain
ingenuously
for
she
has
three
suitors
in
her
train
and
if
she
knew
her
own
mind
there
are
two
of
them
at
least
whom
she
would
find
superfluous
and
request
to
stay
at
home
why
germain
you
don
t
understand
at
all
she
doesn
t
wish
the
old
man
nor
the
blind
man
nor
the
young
man
i
am
quite
certain
yet
if
she
were
to
turn
them
off
people
would
think
that
she
wished
to
remain
a
widow
and
nobody
else
would
come
oh
i
see
these
three
are
used
for
a
guidepost
as
you
like
what
is
the
harm
if
they
are
satisfied
every
man
to
his
taste
said
germain
i
see
that
yours
is
different
now
supposing
that
you
are
chosen
then
they
would
leave
the
coast
clear
yes
supposing
and
meanwhile
how
much
time
should
i
have
to
whistle
that
depends
on
your
persuasive
tongue
i
suppose
until
now
my
daughter
has
always
thought
that
she
would
pass
the
best
part
of
her
life
while
she
was
being
courted
and
she
is
in
no
hurry
to
become
the
servant
of
one
man
when
she
can
order
so
many
others
about
so
she
will
please
herself
as
long
as
the
game
amuses
her
but
if
you
please
her
more
than
the
game
the
game
will
cease
only
you
must
not
lose
courage
come
back
every
sunday
dance
with
her
let
her
know
that
you
are
amongst
her
followers
and
if
she
finds
you
more
agreeable
and
better
bred
than
the
others
some
fine
day
she
will
tell
you
so
no
doubt
excuse
me
father
leonard
your
daughter
has
the
right
to
do
as
she
pleases
and
it
is
not
my
business
to
blame
her
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
should
do
differently
i
should
be
more
frank
and
should
not
waste
the
time
of
men
who
have
doubtless
something
better
to
do
than
dancing
attendance
on
a
woman
who
makes
fun
of
them
still
if
that
is
what
amuses
her
and
makes
her
happy
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
only
there
is
one
thing
i
must
tell
you
which
is
a
little
embarrassing
since
you
have
mistaken
my
intentions
from
the
start
for
you
are
so
sure
of
what
is
not
so
that
you
have
given
me
no
chance
to
explain
you
must
know
then
that
i
did
not
come
here
to
ask
for
your
daughter
in
marriage
but
merely
to
buy
a
pair
of
oxen
which
you
are
going
to
take
to
market
next
week
and
which
my
fatherinlaw
thinks
will
suit
him
i
understand
germain
answered
leonard
very
calmly
you
changed
your
plans
when
you
saw
my
daughter
with
her
admirers
it
is
as
you
please
it
seems
that
what
attracts
some
people
repels
others
and
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
withdraw
for
you
have
not
declared
your
intentions
if
you
wish
seriously
to
buy
my
cattle
come
and
see
them
in
the
pasture
and
whether
we
make
a
bargain
or
not
you
will
come
back
to
dinner
with
us
before
you
return
i
don
t
wish
to
trouble
you
answered
germain
perhaps
you
have
something
to
do
here
i
myself
am
tired
of
watching
the
dancing
and
standing
idle
i
will
go
to
see
your
cattle
and
i
will
soon
join
you
at
your
house
then
germain
made
his
escape
and
walked
away
toward
the
meadows
where
leonard
had
pointed
out
to
him
some
of
his
cattle
it
was
true
that
father
maurice
intended
to
buy
and
germain
thought
that
if
he
were
to
bring
home
a
fine
pair
of
oxen
at
a
reasonable
price
he
might
more
easily
receive
a
pardon
for
wilfully
relinquishing
the
purpose
of
his
journey
he
walked
rapidly
and
soon
found
himself
at
some
distance
from
ormeaux
then
of
a
sudden
he
felt
a
desire
to
kiss
his
son
and
to
see
little
marie
once
again
although
he
had
lost
all
hope
and
even
had
chased
away
the
thought
that
he
might
some
day
owe
his
happiness
to
her
everything
that
he
had
heard
and
seen
this
woman
flirtatious
and
vain
this
father
at
once
shrewd
and
shortsighted
encouraging
his
daughter
in
habits
of
pride
and
untruth
this
city
luxury
which
seemed
to
him
a
transgression
against
the
dignity
of
country
manners
this
time
wasted
in
foolish
empty
words
this
home
so
different
from
his
own
and
above
all
that
deep
uneasiness
which
comes
to
a
laborer
of
the
fields
when
he
leaves
his
accustomed
toil
all
the
trouble
and
annoyance
of
the
past
few
hours
made
germain
long
to
be
with
his
child
and
with
his
little
neighbor
even
had
he
not
been
in
love
he
would
have
sought
her
to
divert
his
mind
and
raise
his
spirits
to
their
wonted
level
but
he
looked
in
vain
over
the
neighboring
meadows
he
saw
neither
little
marie
nor
little
pierre
and
yet
it
was
the
hour
when
shepherds
are
in
the
fields
there
was
a
large
flock
in
a
pasture
he
asked
of
a
young
boy
who
tended
them
whether
the
sheep
belonged
to
the
farm
of
ormeaux
yes
said
the
child
are
you
the
shepherd
do
boys
tend
the
flocks
of
the
farm
amongst
you
no
i
am
taking
care
of
them
today
because
the
shepherdess
went
away
she
was
ill
but
have
you
not
a
new
shepherdess
who
came
this
morning
yes
surely
but
she
too
has
gone
already
what
gone
did
she
not
have
a
child
with
her
yes
a
little
boy
who
cried
they
both
went
away
after
they
had
been
here
two
hours
went
away
where
where
they
came
from
i
suppose
i
didn
t
ask
them
but
why
did
they
go
away
asked
germain
growing
more
and
more
uneasy
how
the
deuce
do
i
know
did
they
not
agree
about
wages
yet
that
must
have
been
settled
before
i
can
tell
you
nothing
about
it
i
saw
them
come
and
go
nothing
more
germain
walked
toward
the
farm
and
questioned
the
farmer
nobody
could
give
him
an
explanation
but
after
speaking
with
the
farmer
he
felt
sure
that
the
girl
had
gone
without
saying
a
word
and
had
taken
the
weeping
child
with
her
can
they
have
been
illtreating
my
son
cried
germain
it
was
your
son
then
how
did
he
happen
to
be
with
the
little
girl
where
do
you
come
from
and
what
is
your
name
germain
seeing
that
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
they
were
answering
him
with
questions
stamped
his
foot
impatiently
and
asked
to
speak
with
the
master
the
master
was
away
usually
he
did
not
spend
the
whole
day
when
he
came
to
the
farm
he
was
on
horseback
and
he
had
ridden
off
to
one
of
his
other
farms
but
honestly
said
germain
growing
very
anxious
can
t
you
tell
me
why
this
girl
left
the
farmer
and
his
wife
exchanged
an
odd
smile
then
the
former
answered
that
he
knew
nothing
and
that
it
was
no
business
of
his
all
that
germain
could
learn
was
that
both
girl
and
child
had
started
off
toward
fourche
he
rushed
back
to
fourche
the
widow
and
her
lovers
were
still
away
so
was
father
leonard
the
maid
told
him
that
a
girl
and
a
child
had
come
to
ask
for
him
but
that
as
she
did
not
know
them
she
did
not
wish
to
let
them
in
and
had
advised
them
to
go
to
mers
and
why
did
you
refuse
to
let
them
in
said
germain
angrily
people
are
very
suspicious
in
this
country
where
nobody
opens
the
door
to
a
neighbor
but
you
see
answered
the
maid
in
a
house
as
rich
as
this
i
must
keep
my
eyes
open
when
the
master
is
away
i
am
responsible
for
everything
and
i
cannot
open
the
door
to
the
first
person
that
comes
along
it
is
a
bad
custom
said
germain
and
i
had
rather
be
poor
than
to
live
in
constant
fear
like
that
goodby
to
you
young
woman
and
goodby
to
your
vile
country
he
made
inquiries
at
the
neighboring
house
the
shepherdess
and
child
had
been
seen
as
the
boy
had
left
belair
suddenly
carelessly
dressed
with
his
blouse
torn
and
his
little
lambskin
over
his
shoulders
and
as
little
marie
was
necessarily
poorly
clad
at
all
times
they
had
been
taken
for
beggars
people
had
offered
them
bread
the
girl
had
accepted
a
crust
for
the
child
who
was
hungry
then
she
had
walked
away
with
him
very
quickly
and
had
entered
the
forest
germain
thought
a
minute
then
he
asked
whether
the
farmer
of
ormeaux
had
not
been
at
fourche
yes
they
answered
he
passed
on
horseback
a
few
seconds
after
the
girl
was
he
chasing
her
oh
so
you
understand
answered
the
village
publican
with
a
laugh
certain
it
is
that
he
is
the
devil
of
a
fellow
for
running
after
girls
but
i
don
t
believe
that
he
caught
her
though
after
all
if
he
had
seen
her
that
is
enough
thank
you
and
he
flew
rather
than
ran
to
leonard
s
stable
throwing
the
saddle
on
the
gray
s
back
he
leaped
upon
it
and
set
off
at
full
gallop
toward
the
wood
of
chanteloube
his
heart
beat
hard
with
fear
and
anger
the
sweat
poured
down
his
forehead
he
spurred
the
mare
till
the
blood
came
though
the
gray
needed
no
pressing
when
she
felt
herself
on
the
road
to
her
stable

xiii
the
old
woman
germain
came
soon
to
the
spot
where
he
had
passed
the
night
on
the
border
of
the
pool
the
fire
was
smoking
still
an
old
woman
was
gathering
the
remnants
of
the
wood
little
marie
had
piled
there
germain
stopped
to
question
her
she
was
deaf
and
mistook
his
inquiries
yes
my
son
said
she
this
is
the
devil
s
pool
it
is
an
evil
spot
and
you
must
not
approach
it
without
throwing
in
three
stones
with
your
left
hand
while
you
cross
yourself
with
the
right
that
drives
away
the
spirits
otherwise
trouble
comes
to
those
who
go
around
it
i
am
not
asking
about
that
said
germain
moving
nearer
her
and
screaming
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
have
you
seen
a
girl
and
a
child
walking
through
the
wood
yes
said
the
old
woman
a
little
child
was
drowned
there
germain
shook
from
head
to
foot
but
happily
the
hag
added
that
happened
a
long
time
ago
in
memory
of
the
accident
they
raised
a
handsome
cross
there
but
one
stormy
night
the
bad
spirits
threw
it
into
the
water
you
can
still
see
one
end
of
it
if
anybody
were
unlucky
enough
to
pass
the
night
here
he
could
never
find
his
way
out
before
daylight
he
must
walk
and
walk
and
though
he
went
two
hundred
leagues
into
the
forest
he
must
always
return
to
the
same
place
the
peasant
s
imagination
was
aroused
in
spite
of
himself
and
the
thought
of
the
evils
that
must
come
in
order
that
the
old
woman
s
assertions
might
be
vindicated
took
so
firm
a
hold
of
his
mind
that
he
felt
chilled
through
and
through
hopeless
of
obtaining
more
news
he
remounted
and
traversed
the
woods
afresh
calling
pierre
with
all
his
might
whistling
cracking
his
whip
and
snapping
the
branches
that
the
whole
forest
might
reëcho
with
the
noise
of
his
coming
then
he
listened
for
an
answering
voice
but
he
heard
no
sound
save
the
cowbells
scattered
through
the
glades
and
the
wild
cries
of
the
swine
as
they
fought
over
the
acorns
at
length
germain
heard
behind
him
the
noise
of
a
horse
following
in
his
traces
and
a
man
of
middle
age
dark
sturdy
and
dressed
after
the
city
fashion
called
to
him
to
stop
germain
had
never
seen
the
farmer
of
ormeaux
but
his
instinctive
rage
told
him
at
once
that
this
was
the
man
he
turned
and
eyeing
him
from
head
to
foot
waited
for
him
to
speak
have
not
you
seen
a
young
girl
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
go
by
with
a
small
boy
asked
the
farmer
with
an
assumed
air
of
indifference
although
he
was
evidently
ill
at
ease
what
do
you
want
of
her
answered
germain
taking
no
pains
to
conceal
his
anger
i
might
tell
you
that
that
is
none
of
your
business
my
friend
but
as
i
have
no
reasons
for
secrecy
i
shall
tell
you
that
she
is
a
shepherdess
whom
i
engaged
for
a
year
before
i
knew
her
when
i
saw
her
she
looked
too
young
and
frail
to
work
on
the
farm
i
thanked
her
but
i
wished
to
pay
the
expenses
of
her
short
journey
and
while
my
back
was
turned
she
went
off
in
a
huff
she
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
forgot
even
some
of
her
belongings
and
her
purse
which
has
certainly
not
much
in
it
probably
but
a
few
pennies
but
since
i
was
going
in
this
direction
i
hoped
to
meet
her
and
give
her
back
the
things
which
she
left
behind
as
well
as
what
i
owe
her
germain
had
too
honest
a
heart
not
to
pause
at
hearing
a
story
which
however
unlikely
was
not
impossible
he
fastened
his
penetrating
gaze
on
the
farmer
who
submitted
to
the
examination
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
impudence
or
of
good
faith
i
wish
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
matter
said
germain
and
continued
he
suppressing
his
indignation
the
girl
lives
in
my
village
i
know
her
she
can
t
be
far
away
let
s
ride
on
together
we
shall
find
her
no
doubt
you
are
right
said
the
farmer
let
s
move
on
but
if
we
do
not
find
her
before
we
reach
the
end
of
this
road
i
shall
give
up
for
i
must
turn
off
toward
ardentes
oh
oh
thought
the
peasant
i
shall
not
part
with
you
even
if
i
have
to
follow
you
around
the
devil
s
pool
for
twentyfour
hours
stop
said
germain
suddenly
fixing
his
eyes
on
a
clump
of
broom
which
waved
in
a
peculiar
manner
halloa
halloa
petit
pierre
is
that
you
my
child
the
boy
recognized
his
father
s
voice
and
came
out
from
the
broom
leaping
like
a
young
deer
but
when
he
saw
germain
in
company
with
the
farmer
he
stopped
dismayed
and
stood
irresolute
come
my
pierre
come
it
is
i
cried
the
husbandman
as
he
leaped
from
his
horse
and
ran
toward
his
boy
to
take
him
in
his
arms
and
where
is
little
marie
she
is
hiding
there
because
she
is
afraid
of
that
dreadful
black
man
and
so
am
i
you
needn
t
be
afraid
i
am
here
marie
marie
it
is
i
marie
crept
toward
them
but
the
moment
she
saw
germain
with
the
farmer
close
behind
she
sprang
forward
and
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
clung
to
him
as
a
daughter
to
her
father
oh
my
brave
germain
she
cried
you
will
defend
me
i
am
not
afraid
when
you
are
near
germain
shuddered
he
looked
at
marie
she
was
pale
her
clothes
were
torn
by
the
thorns
which
had
scratched
her
as
she
passed
rushing
toward
the
brake
like
a
stag
chased
by
the
hunters
but
neither
shame
nor
despair
were
in
her
face
your
master
wishes
to
speak
to
you
said
he
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
features
my
master
she
exclaimed
fiercely
that
man
is
no
master
of
mine
and
he
never
shall
be
you
germain
you
are
my
master
i
want
you
to
take
me
home
with
you
i
will
be
your
servant
for
nothing
the
farmer
advanced
feigning
impatience
little
girl
said
he
you
left
something
behind
at
the
farm
which
i
am
bringing
back
to
you
no
you
are
not
sir
answered
little
marie
i
didn
t
forget
anything
and
i
have
nothing
to
ask
of
you
listen
a
moment
returned
the
farmer
it
s
i
who
have
something
to
tell
you
come
with
me
don
t
be
afraid
it
s
only
a
word
or
two
you
may
say
them
aloud
i
have
no
secrets
with
you
at
any
rate
do
take
your
money
my
money
you
owe
me
nothing
thank
god
i
suspected
as
much
said
germain
under
his
breath
but
i
don
t
care
marie
listen
to
what
he
has
to
say
to
you
fori
am
curious
to
know
you
can
tell
me
afterward
go
up
to
his
horse
i
shall
not
lose
sight
of
you
marie
took
three
steps
toward
the
farmer
he
bent
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
and
lowering
his
voice
he
said
little
girl
here
is
a
bright
golden
louis
for
you
don
t
say
anything
about
it
do
you
hear
i
shall
say
that
i
found
you
too
frail
to
work
on
my
farm
there
will
be
no
more
talk
about
that
i
shall
be
passing
by
your
house
one
of
these
days
and
if
you
have
not
said
anything
i
will
give
you
something
more
and
then
if
you
are
more
sensible
you
have
only
to
speak
i
will
take
you
home
with
me
or
i
will
come
at
dusk
and
talk
with
you
in
the
meadows
what
present
would
you
like
me
to
bring
you
here
sir
is
the
present
i
have
for
you
answered
little
marie
aloud
as
she
threw
the
golden
louis
in
his
face
with
all
her
might
i
thank
you
heartily
and
i
beg
that
if
you
come
anywhere
near
our
house
you
will
be
good
enough
to
let
me
know
all
the
boys
in
the
neighborhood
will
go
out
to
welcome
you
because
where
i
live
we
are
very
fond
of
gentlemen
who
try
to
make
love
to
poor
girls
you
shall
see
they
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
you
you
lie
with
your
dirty
tongue
cried
the
farmer
raising
his
stick
with
a
dangerous
air
you
wish
to
make
people
believe
what
is
not
so
but
you
shall
never
get
a
penny
out
of
me
we
know
what
kind
of
a
girl
you
are
marie
drew
back
frightened
and
germain
sprang
to
the
bridle
of
the
farmer
s
horse
and
shook
it
violently
i
understand
now
said
he
it
is
easy
to
see
what
is
going
on
get
down
my
man
get
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
the
farmer
was
not
eager
to
take
up
the
quarrel
anxious
to
escape
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
tried
to
loosen
the
peasant
s
grasp
by
striking
down
his
hands
with
a
cane
but
germain
dodged
the
blow
and
seizing
hold
of
his
antagonist
s
leg
he
unseated
him
and
flung
him
to
the
earth
the
farmer
regained
his
feet
but
although
he
defended
himself
vigorously
he
was
knocked
down
once
more
germain
held
him
to
the
ground
then
he
said
poor
coward
i
could
thrash
you
if
i
wished
but
i
don
t
want
to
do
you
an
injury
and
besides
no
amount
of
punishment
would
help
your
consciencebut
you
shall
not
stir
from
this
spot
until
you
beg
the
girl
s
pardon
on
your
knees
the
farmer
understood
this
sort
of
thing
and
wished
to
take
it
all
as
a
joke
he
made
believe
that
his
offense
was
not
serious
since
it
lay
in
words
alone
and
protested
that
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
ask
her
pardon
provided
he
might
kiss
the
girl
afterward
finally
he
proposed
that
they
go
and
drink
a
pint
of
wine
at
the
nearest
tavern
and
so
part
good
friends
you
are
disgusting
answered
germain
rubbing
his
victim
s
head
in
the
dirt
and
i
never
wish
to
see
your
nasty
face
again
so
blush
if
you
are
able
and
when
you
come
to
our
village
you
had
better
slink
along
sneak
s
alley
he
picked
up
the
farmer
s
hollystick
broke
it
over
his
knee
to
show
the
strength
of
his
wrists
and
threw
away
the
pieces
with
disgust
then
giving
one
hand
to
his
son
and
the
other
to
little
marie
he
walked
away
still
trembling
with
anger
this
is
the
road
which
diverging
from
the
principal
street
at
the
entrance
of
villages
makes
a
circuit
about
them
persons
who
are
in
dread
of
receiving
some
well
deserved
insult
are
supposed
to
take
this
route
to
escape

xiv
the
return
to
the
farm
at
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
they
had
left
the
heath
behind
them
they
trotted
along
the
highroad
and
the
gray
whinnied
at
each
familiar
object
petitpierre
told
his
father
as
much
as
he
could
understand
of
what
had
passed
when
we
reached
the
farm
said
he
that
man
came
to
speak
to
my
marie
in
the
fold
where
we
had
gone
to
see
the
pretty
sheep
i
had
climbed
into
the
manger
to
play
and
that
man
did
not
see
me
then
he
said
good
morning
to
marie
and
he
kissed
her
you
allowed
him
to
kiss
you
marie
said
germain
trembling
with
anger
i
thought
it
was
a
civility
a
custom
of
the
place
to
newcomers
just
as
at
your
farm
the
grandmother
kisses
the
young
girls
who
enter
her
service
to
show
that
she
adopts
them
and
will
be
a
mother
to
them
and
next
went
on
little
pierre
who
was
proud
to
have
an
adventure
to
tell
of
that
man
told
you
something
wicked
which
you
have
told
me
never
to
repeat
and
not
even
remember
so
i
forgot
it
right
away
still
if
father
wishes
i
will
tell
him
what
it
was
no
pierre
i
don
t
wish
to
hear
and
i
don
t
wish
you
ever
to
think
of
it
again
then
i
will
forget
it
all
over
again
replied
the
child
next
that
man
seemed
to
be
growing
angry
because
marie
told
him
that
she
was
going
away
he
told
her
he
would
give
her
whatever
she
wanteda
hundred
francs
and
my
marie
grew
angry
too
then
he
came
toward
her
as
if
he
wished
to
hurt
her
i
was
afraid
and
i
ran
to
marie
and
cried
then
that
man
said
what
s
that
where
did
that
child
come
from
put
it
out
and
he
raised
his
cane
to
beat
me
but
my
marie
prevented
him
and
she
spoke
to
him
this
way
we
will
talk
later
sir
now
i
must
take
this
child
back
to
fourche
and
then
i
shall
return
and
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
fold
my
marie
spoke
to
me
this
way
we
must
run
my
pierre
we
must
get
away
as
quickly
as
we
can
for
this
is
a
wicked
man
and
he
is
trying
to
do
us
harm
then
when
we
had
gone
back
of
the
farmhouses
we
crossed
a
little
meadow
and
we
went
to
fourche
to
find
you
but
you
were
not
there
and
they
wouldn
t
let
us
wait
and
then
that
man
riding
his
black
horse
came
behind
us
and
we
ran
on
as
fast
as
we
could
and
hid
in
the
woods
and
then
he
followed
us
and
when
we
heard
him
coming
we
hid
again
and
then
when
he
had
passed
we
began
to
run
toward
home
and
then
you
came
and
found
us
and
that
is
how
it
all
happened
i
haven
t
forgotten
anything
have
i
my
marie
no
my
pierre
that
is
the
whole
truth
now
germain
you
must
be
my
witness
and
tell
everybody
in
the
village
that
if
i
did
not
stay
there
it
was
not
from
want
of
courage
and
industry
and
marie
i
want
to
ask
of
you
whether
a
man
of
twentyeight
is
too
old
when
there
is
a
woman
to
be
defended
and
an
insult
to
be
revenged
i
should
like
to
know
whether
bastien
or
any
other
pretty
boy
ten
years
better
off
than
i
would
not
have
been
knocked
to
pieces
by
that
man
as
petitpierre
says
what
do
you
think
i
think
germain
that
you
have
done
me
a
great
service
and
that
i
shall
be
grateful
all
my
life
is
that
all
little
father
said
the
child
i
forgot
to
ask
little
marie
what
i
promised
i
have
not
had
time
yet
but
i
will
speak
to
her
at
home
and
i
will
speak
to
my
grandmother
too
the
child
s
promise
set
germain
to
thinking
he
must
explain
his
conduct
to
his
family
and
give
his
objections
to
the
widow
guam
and
all
the
while
conceal
the
true
reasons
which
had
made
him
so
judicious
and
so
decided
when
a
man
is
proud
and
happy
it
seems
an
easy
task
to
thrust
his
happiness
upon
others
but
to
be
repulsed
on
one
side
and
blamed
on
the
other
is
not
a
very
pleasant
position
fortunately
petitpierre
was
fast
asleep
when
they
reached
the
farm
and
germain
put
him
to
bed
undisturbed
then
he
began
upon
all
sorts
of
explanations
father
maurice
seated
on
a
threelegged
stool
before
the
door
listened
with
gravity
and
although
he
was
illcontent
with
the
result
of
the
journey
when
germain
told
him
about
the
widow
s
systematic
coquetry
and
demanded
of
his
fatherinlaw
whether
he
had
the
time
to
go
and
pay
his
court
fiftytwo
sundays
in
the
year
at
the
risk
of
being
dismissed
in
the
end
the
old
man
nodded
his
head
in
assent
and
answered
you
were
not
wrong
germain
that
could
never
be
and
then
when
germain
described
how
he
had
been
obliged
to
bring
back
little
marie
with
the
utmost
haste
in
order
to
protect
her
from
the
insults
or
perhaps
from
the
violence
of
a
wicked
master
father
maurice
nodded
approvingly
again
and
said
you
were
not
wrong
germain
that
was
right
when
germain
had
told
his
story
and
had
set
forth
all
his
reasons
the
old
farmer
and
his
wife
heaved
deep
simultaneous
sighs
of
resignation
and
looked
at
each
other
then
the
head
of
the
house
rose
and
said
god
s
will
be
done
love
can
t
be
made
to
order
come
to
supper
germain
said
his
motherinlaw
it
is
unfortunate
that
this
did
not
come
to
a
better
end
but
after
all
it
seems
that
god
did
not
wish
it
we
must
look
elsewhere
yes
added
the
old
man
as
my
wife
says
we
must
look
elsewhere
there
was
no
more
noise
at
the
house
and
on
the
morrow
when
petitpierre
rose
with
the
larks
at
dawn
he
was
no
longer
excited
by
the
extraordinary
events
of
the
preceding
days
like
other
little
peasants
of
his
age
he
became
indifferent
forgot
everything
that
had
been
running
in
his
head
and
thought
only
of
playing
with
his
brothers
and
of
pretending
to
drive
the
horses
and
oxen
like
a
man
germain
plunged
into
his
work
and
tried
to
forget
too
but
he
became
so
absentminded
and
so
sad
that
everybody
noticed
it
he
never
spoke
to
little
marie
he
never
even
looked
at
her
and
yet
had
anybody
asked
him
in
what
meadow
she
was
or
by
what
road
she
had
passed
there
was
not
a
moment
in
the
day
when
he
could
not
have
answered
if
he
would
he
dared
not
ask
his
family
to
take
her
in
at
the
farm
during
the
winter
and
yet
he
knew
well
how
she
must
suffer
from
want
but
she
did
not
suffer
and
mother
guillette
could
not
understand
how
her
little
store
of
wood
never
grew
less
and
how
her
shed
was
full
in
the
morning
although
she
had
left
it
almost
empty
at
night
it
was
the
same
with
the
wheat
and
potatoes
somebody
entered
by
the
garret
window
and
emptied
a
sack
on
the
floor
without
awaking
a
soul
or
leaving
a
trace
of
his
coming
the
widow
was
at
once
uneasy
and
delighted
she
made
her
daughter
promise
to
tell
nobody
and
said
that
were
people
to
know
of
the
miracle
performed
at
her
house
they
would
take
her
for
a
witch
she
felt
confident
that
the
devil
had
a
share
in
it
but
she
was
in
no
hurry
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
by
calling
down
the
priest
s
exorcisms
on
the
house
it
would
be
time
enough
she
said
when
satan
should
come
to
demand
her
soul
in
return
for
his
gifts
little
marie
understood
the
truth
better
but
she
dared
not
speak
to
germain
for
fear
of
seeing
him
return
to
his
dreams
of
marriage
and
before
him
she
pretended
to
perceive
nothing

mother
maurice
one
day
mother
maurice
was
alone
in
the
orchard
with
germain
and
spoke
to
him
kindly
my
poor
son
i
believe
you
are
not
well
you
don
t
eat
as
well
as
usual
you
never
laugh
you
talk
less
and
less
perhaps
one
of
us
or
all
of
us
have
hurt
your
feelings
without
knowing
and
without
wishing
it
no
my
mother
answered
germain
you
have
always
been
as
kind
to
me
as
the
mother
who
brought
me
into
the
world
and
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
if
i
were
to
complain
of
you
or
your
husband
or
of
anybody
in
the
household
then
my
child
it
is
the
sorrow
for
your
wife
s
death
which
comes
back
to
you
instead
of
growing
lighter
with
time
your
grief
becomes
worse
and
as
your
father
has
said
very
wisely
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
you
to
marry
again
yes
my
mother
that
is
my
opinion
but
the
women
whom
you
advised
me
to
ask
don
t
suit
me
whenever
i
see
them
instead
of
forgetting
my
catherine
i
think
of
her
all
the
more
apparently
that
s
because
we
haven
t
been
able
to
understand
your
taste
you
must
help
us
by
telling
us
the
truth
there
must
be
a
woman
somewhere
who
is
made
for
you
for
god
doesn
t
make
anybody
without
placing
his
happiness
in
somebody
else
so
if
you
know
where
to
find
this
woman
whom
you
need
take
her
and
be
she
pretty
or
ugly
young
or
old
rich
or
poor
we
have
made
up
our
minds
my
husband
and
i
to
give
our
consent
for
we
are
tired
of
seeing
you
so
sad
and
we
can
never
be
happy
while
you
are
sorrowful
my
mother
you
are
as
kind
as
the
kind
lord
and
so
is
my
father
answered
germain
but
your
compassion
brings
small
help
to
my
troubles
for
the
girl
i
love
doesn
t
care
for
me
she
is
too
young
then
it
s
foolish
for
you
to
love
a
young
girl
yes
mother
dear
i
have
been
foolish
enough
to
love
a
young
girl
and
it
s
my
fault
i
do
my
best
to
stop
thinking
of
it
but
working
or
sleeping
at
mass
or
in
bed
with
my
children
or
with
you
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
then
it
s
like
a
fate
cast
over
you
germain
there
s
but
one
remedy
and
it
is
that
this
girl
must
change
her
mind
and
listen
to
you
it
s
my
duty
to
look
into
this
and
see
whether
it
s
practicable
tell
me
where
she
lives
and
what
s
her
name
oh
my
dear
mother
i
dare
not
said
germain
because
you
will
make
fun
of
me
i
shall
not
make
fun
of
you
germain
because
you
are
in
trouble
and
i
don
t
wish
to
make
it
harder
for
you
is
it
fanchette
no
mother
of
course
not
or
rosette
no
tell
me
then
for
i
shall
never
finish
if
i
must
name
every
girl
in
the
countryside
germain
bowed
his
head
and
could
not
bring
himself
to
answer
very
good
said
mother
maurice
i
shall
let
you
alone
for
today
tomorrow
perhaps
you
will
be
more
confidential
with
me
or
possibly
your
sisterinlaw
will
question
you
more
cleverly
and
she
picked
up
her
basket
to
go
and
spread
her
linen
on
the
bushes
germain
acted
like
children
who
make
up
their
minds
when
they
see
that
they
are
no
longer
attracting
attention
he
followed
his
mother
and
at
length
trembling
he
named
marie
of
guillette
great
was
the
surprise
of
mother
maurice
marie
was
the
last
person
she
would
have
dreamed
of
but
she
had
the
delicacy
not
to
cry
out
and
made
her
comments
to
herself
then
seeing
that
her
silence
hurt
germain
she
stretched
out
her
basket
toward
him
and
said
is
there
any
reason
for
not
helping
me
at
my
work
carry
this
load
and
come
and
talk
with
me
have
you
reflected
well
germain
are
you
fully
decided
alas
dear
mother
you
mustn
t
speak
in
that
way
i
should
be
decided
if
i
had
a
chance
of
success
but
as
i
could
never
be
heard
i
have
only
made
up
my
mind
to
cure
myself
if
i
can
and
if
you
can
t
there
is
an
end
to
everything
mother
maurice
when
the
horse
is
laden
too
heavily
he
falls
and
when
the
cow
has
nothing
to
eat
she
dies
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
die
if
you
do
not
succeed
god
grant
not
germain
i
don
t
like
to
hear
a
man
like
you
talk
of
those
things
for
what
he
says
he
thinks
you
are
very
brave
and
weakness
is
dangerous
for
strong
men
take
heart
i
can
t
conceive
that
a
povertystricken
girl
whom
you
have
honored
so
much
as
to
ask
her
to
marry
you
will
refuse
you
yet
it
s
the
truth
she
does
refuse
me
and
what
reasons
does
she
give
you
that
you
have
always
been
kind
to
her
and
that
her
family
owes
a
great
deal
to
yours
and
that
she
doesn
t
wish
to
displease
you
by
turning
me
away
from
a
rich
marriage
if
she
says
that
she
proves
her
good
sense
and
shows
what
an
honest
girl
she
is
but
germain
she
doesn
t
cure
you
for
of
course
she
tells
you
that
she
loves
you
and
would
marry
you
if
we
were
willing
that
s
the
worst
part
of
all
she
says
that
her
heart
can
never
be
mine
if
she
says
what
she
doesn
t
think
in
order
to
keep
you
at
a
safer
distance
the
child
deserves
our
love
and
we
should
pass
over
her
youth
on
account
of
her
great
good
sense
yes
said
germain
struck
by
a
hope
he
had
never
held
before
that
would
be
very
wise
and
right
of
her
but
if
she
is
so
sensible
i
am
sure
it
is
because
i
displease
her
germain
said
mother
maurice
you
must
promise
me
not
to
worry
for
a
whole
week
keep
from
tormenting
yourself
eat
sleep
and
be
as
gay
as
you
used
to
be
for
my
part
i
ll
speak
to
my
husband
and
if
i
gain
his
consent
you
shall
know
the
girl
s
real
feelings
toward
you
germain
promised
and
the
week
passed
without
a
single
word
in
private
from
father
maurice
who
seemed
to
suspect
nothing
the
husbandman
did
his
best
to
look
calm
but
he
grew
ever
paler
and
more
troubled

xvi
little
marie
at
length
on
sunday
morning
when
mass
was
over
his
motherinlaw
asked
germain
what
encouragement
he
had
had
from
his
sweetheart
since
the
conversation
in
the
orchard
why
none
at
all
answered
he
i
haven
t
spoken
to
her
how
can
you
expect
to
win
her
if
you
don
t
speak
to
her
i
have
spoken
to
her
but
once
replied
germain
that
was
when
we
were
together
at
fourche
and
since
then
i
haven
t
said
a
single
word
her
refusal
gave
me
so
much
pain
that
i
had
rather
not
hear
her
begin
again
to
tell
me
that
she
doesn
t
love
me
but
my
son
you
must
speak
to
her
now
your
father
gives
his
approval
so
make
up
your
mind
i
tell
you
to
do
it
and
if
need
be
i
shall
order
you
to
do
it
for
you
can
t
rest
in
this
uncertainty
germain
obeyed
he
reached
mother
guillette
s
house
hanging
his
head
with
a
hopeless
air
little
marie
sat
alone
before
the
hearth
so
thoughtful
that
she
did
not
hear
germain
s
step
when
she
saw
him
before
her
she
started
from
her
chair
in
surprise
and
grew
very
red
little
marie
said
he
sitting
down
near
her
i
come
to
trouble
you
and
to
give
you
pain
i
know
it
very
well
but
the
man
and
his
wife
at
home
it
was
thus
after
the
peasant
fashion
that
he
designated
the
heads
of
the
house
wish
me
to
speak
to
you
and
beg
you
to
marry
me
you
don
t
care
for
me
i
am
prepared
for
it
germain
answered
little
marie
are
you
sure
that
you
love
me
it
pains
you
i
know
but
it
isn
t
my
fault
if
you
could
change
your
mind
i
should
be
so
very
happy
and
certain
it
is
that
i
don
t
deserve
it
look
at
me
marie
am
i
very
terrible
no
germain
she
answered
with
a
smile
you
are
better
looking
than
i
don
t
make
fun
of
me
look
at
me
charitably
as
yet
i
have
never
lost
a
single
hair
nor
a
single
tooth
my
eyes
tell
you
plainly
how
much
i
love
you
look
straight
into
my
eyes
it
is
written
there
and
every
girl
knows
how
to
read
that
writing
marie
looked
into
germain
s
eyes
with
playful
boldness
then
of
a
sudden
she
turned
away
her
head
and
trembled
good
god
exclaimed
germain
i
make
you
afraid
you
look
at
me
as
though
i
were
the
farmer
of
ormeaux
don
t
be
afraid
of
me
please
don
t
that
hurts
me
too
much
i
shall
not
say
any
bad
words
to
you
i
shall
not
kiss
you
if
you
will
not
have
me
and
when
you
wish
me
to
go
away
you
have
only
to
show
me
the
door
must
i
go
in
order
to
stop
your
trembling
marie
held
out
her
hand
toward
the
husbandman
but
without
turning
her
head
which
was
bent
on
the
fireplace
and
without
saying
a
word
i
understand
said
germain
you
pity
me
for
you
are
kind
you
are
sorry
to
make
me
unhappy
but
you
can
t
love
me
why
do
you
say
these
things
to
me
germain
answered
little
marie
after
a
pause
do
you
wish
to
make
me
cry
poor
little
girl
you
have
a
kind
heart
i
know
but
you
don
t
love
me
and
you
are
hiding
your
face
for
fear
of
letting
me
see
your
dislike
and
your
repugnance
and
i
i
dare
not
even
clasp
your
hand
in
the
forest
when
my
boy
was
asleep
and
you
were
sleeping
too
i
almost
kissed
you
very
gently
but
i
would
have
died
of
shame
rather
than
ask
it
of
you
and
that
night
i
suffered
as
a
man
burning
over
a
slow
fire
since
that
time
i
have
dreamed
of
you
every
night
ah
how
i
have
kissed
you
marie
yet
during
all
that
time
you
have
slept
without
a
dream
and
now
do
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
that
were
you
to
turn
and
look
at
me
with
the
eyes
i
have
for
you
and
were
you
to
move
your
face
close
to
mine
i
believe
i
should
fall
dead
for
joy
and
you
you
think
that
if
such
a
thing
were
to
happen
you
would
die
of
anger
and
shame
germain
spoke
as
in
a
dream
not
hearing
the
words
he
said
little
marie
was
trembling
all
the
time
but
he
was
shaking
yet
more
and
did
not
notice
it
of
a
sudden
she
turned
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
she
looked
at
him
reproachfully
the
poor
husbandman
thought
that
this
was
the
last
blow
and
without
waiting
for
his
sentence
he
rose
to
go
but
the
girl
stopped
him
and
throwing
both
her
arms
about
him
she
hid
her
face
in
his
breast
oh
germain
she
sobbed
didn
t
you
feel
that
i
loved
you
then
germain
had
gone
mad
if
his
son
who
came
galloping
into
the
cottage
on
a
stick
with
his
little
sister
on
the
crupper
scourging
the
imaginary
steed
with
a
willow
branch
had
not
brought
him
to
his
senses
he
lifted
the
boy
and
placed
him
in
the
girl
s
arms
see
said
he
by
loving
me
you
have
made
more
than

appendix
i
a

wedding
here
ends
the
history
of
germain
s
marriage
as
he
told
it
to
me
himself
good
husbandman
that
he
is
i
ask
your
forgiveness
kind
reader
that
i
know
not
how
to
translate
it
better
for
it
is
a
real
translation
that
is
needed
by
this
oldfashioned
and
artless
language
of
the
peasants
of
the
country
that
i
sing
as
they
used
to
say
these
people
speak
french
that
is
too
true
for
us
and
since
rabelais
and
montaigne
the
advance
of
the
language
has
lost
for
us
many
of
its
old
riches
thus
it
is
with
every
advance
and
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
yet
it
is
a
pleasure
still
to
hear
those
picturesque
idioms
used
in
the
old
districts
in
the
center
of
france
all
the
more
because
it
is
the
genuine
expression
of
the
laughing
quiet
and
delightfully
talkative
character
of
the
people
who
make
use
of
it
touraine
has
preserved
a
certain
precious
number
of
patriarchal
phrases
but
touraine
was
civilized
greatly
during
the
renaissance
and
since
its
decline
she
is
filled
with
fine
houses
and
highroads
with
foreigners
and
traffic
berry
remained
as
she
was
and
i
think
that
after
brittany
and
a
few
provinces
in
the
far
south
of
france
it
is
the
best
preserved
district
to
be
found
at
the
present
day
some
of
the
costumes
are
so
strange
and
so
curious
that
i
hope
to
amuse
you

you

assisting

for

everything
passes
during
my
life
alone
more
change
has
taken
place
in
the
ideas
and
in
the
customs
of
my
village
than
had
been
seen
in
the
centuries
before
the
revolution
already
half
the
ceremonies
celtic
pagan

of
the
middle
ages
that
in
my
childhood
i
have
seen
in
their
full
vigor
have
disappeared
in
a
year
or
two
more
perhaps
the
railroads
will
lay
their
level
tracks
across
our
deep
valleys
and
will
carry
away
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
all
our
old
traditions
and
our
wonderful
legends
it
was
in
winter
about
the
carnival
season
the
time
of
year
when
in
our
country
it
is
fitting
and
proper
to
have
weddings
in
summer
the
time
can
hardly
be
spared

the
work
of
the
farm
cannot
suffer
three
days
delay
not
to
speak
of
the
additional
days
impaired
to
a
greater
or
to
a
less
degree
by
the
moral
and
physical
drunkenness
which
follows
a
galaday
i
was
seated
beneath
the
great
mantelpiece
of
the
oldfashioned
kitchen
fireplace
when
shots
of
pistols
barking
of
dogs
and
the
piercing
notes
of
the
bagpipe
told
me
that
the
bridal
pair
were
approaching
very
soon
father
and
mother
maurice
germain
and
little
marie
followed
by
jacques
and
his
wife
the
closer
relatives
and
the
godfathers
and
godmothers
of
the
bride
and
groom
all
made
their
entry
into
the
yard
little
marie
had
not
yet
received
her
weddinggiftsfavors
as
they
call
themand
was
dressed
in
the
best
of
her
simple
clothes
a
dress
of
dark
heavy
cloth
a
white
fichu
with
great
spots
of
brilliant
color
an
apron
of
carnationan
indian
red
much
in
vogue
at
the
time
but
despised
nowadaysa
cap
of
very
white
muslin
after
that
pattern
happily
still
preserved
which
calls
to
mind
the
headdress
of
anne
boleyn
and
of
agnes
sorrel
she
was
fresh
and
laughing
but
not
at
all
vain
though
she
had
good
reason
to
be
so
beside
her
was
germain
serious
and
tender
like
young
jacob
greeting
rebecca
at
the
wells
of
laban
another
girl
would
have
assumed
an
important
air
and
struck
an
attitude
of
triumph
for
in
every
rank
it
is
something
to
be
married
for
a
fair
face
alone
yet
the
girl
s
eyes
were
moist
and
shone
with
tenderness
it
was
plain
that
she
was
deep
in
love
and
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
opinions
of
others
her
little
air
of
determination
was
not
absent
but
everything
about
her
denoted
frankness
and
goodwill
there
was
nothing
impertinent
in
her
success
nothing
selfish
in
her
sense
of
power
never
have
i
seen
so
lovely
a
bride
when
she
answered
with
frankness
her
young
friends
who
asked
if
she
were
happy
surely
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
the
good
lord
father
maurice
was
spokesman
he
came
forward
to
pay
his
compliments
and
give
the
customary
invitations
first
he
fastened
to
the
mantelpiece
a
branch
of
laurel
decked
out
with
ribbons
this
is
known
as
the
writthat
is
to
say
the
letter
of
announcement
next
he
gave
to
every
guest
a
tiny
cross
made
of
a
bit
of
blue
ribbon
sewn
to
a
transverse
bit
of
pink
ribbonpink
for
the
bride
blue
for
the
groom
the
guests
of
both
sexes
were
expected
to
keep
this
badge
to
adorn
their
caps
or
their
buttonholes
on
the
weddingday
this
is
the
letter
of
invitation
the
admission
ticket
then
father
maurice
paid
his
congratulations
he
invited
the
head
of
the
house
and
all
his
companythat
is
to
say
all
his
children
all
his
friends
and
all
his
servantsto
the
benediction
to
the
feast
to
the
sports
to
the
dance
and
to
everything
that
follows
he
did
not
fail
to
say
i
have
come
to
do
you
the
honor
of
inviting
you
a
very
right
manner
of
speech
even
though
it
appears
to
us
to
convey
the
wrong
meaning
for
it
expresses
the
idea
of
doing
honor
to
those
who
seem
worthy
of
it
despite
the
generosity
of
the
invitation
carried
from
house
to
house
throughout
the
parish
politeness
which
is
very
cautious
amongst
peasants
demands
that
only
two
persons
from
each
family
take
advantage
of
itone
of
the
heads
of
the
house
and
one
from
the
number
of
their
children
after
the
invitations
were
made
the
betrothed
couple
and
their
families
took
dinner
together
at
the
farm
little
marie
kept
her
three
sheep
on
the
common
and
germain
tilled
the
soil
as
though
nothing
had
happened
about
two
in
the
afternoon
before
the
day
set
for
the
wedding
the
music
came
the
music
means
the
players
of
the
bagpipe
and
hurdygurdy
their
instruments
decorated
with
long
streaming
ribbons
playing
an
appropriate
march
to
a
measure
which
would
have
been
rather
slow
for
feet
foreign
to
the
soil
but
admirably
adapted
to
the
heavy
ground
and
hilly
roads
of
the
country
pistolshots
fired
by
the
young
people
and
the
children
announced
the
beginning
of
the
wedding
ceremonies
little
by
little
the
guests
assembled
and
danced
on
the
grassplot
before
the
house
in
order
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
when
evening
was
come
they
began
strange
preparations
they
divided
into
two
bands
and
when
night
had
settled
down
they
proceeded
to
the
ceremony
of
the
favors
all
this
passed
at
the
dwelling
of
the
bride
mother
guillette
s
cottage
mother
guillette
took
with
her
her
daughter
a
dozen
pretty
shepherdesses
friends
and
relatives
of
her
daughter
two
or
three
respectable
housewives
talkative
neighbors
quick
of
wit
and
strict
guardians
of
ancient
customs
next
she
chose
a
dozen
stout
fellows
her
relatives
and
friends
and
last
of
all
the
parish
hempdresser
a
garrulous
old
man
and
as
good
a
talker
as
ever
there
was
the
part
which
in
brittany
is
played
by
the
bazvalon
the
village
tailor
is
taken
in
our
part
of
the
country
by
the
hempdresser
and
the
woolcarder
two
professions
which
are
unusually
combined
in
one
he
is
present
at
all
ceremonies
sad
or
gay
for
he
is
very
learned
and
a
fluent
talker
and
on
these
occasions
he
must
always
figure
as
spokesman
in
order
to
fulfil
with
exactitude
certain
formalities
used
from
time
immemorial
traveling
occupations
which
bring
a
man
into
the
midst
of
other
families
without
allowing
him
to
shut
himself
up
within
his
own
are
well
fitted
to
make
him
talker
wit
storyteller
and
singer
the
hempdresser
is
peculiarly
skeptical
he
and
another
village
functionary
of
whom
we
have
spoken
before
the
gravedigger
are
always
the
daring
spirits
of
the
neighborhood
they
have
talked
so
much
about
ghosts
and
they
know
so
well
all
the
tricks
of
which
these
malicious
spirits
are
capable
that
they
fear
them
scarcely
at
all
it
is
especially
at
night
that
all
of
themgravediggers
hempdressers
and
ghostsdo
their
work
it
is
also
at
night
when
the
hempdresser
tells
his
melancholy
stories
permit
me
to
make
a
digression
when
the
hemp
has
reached
the
right
stage
that
is
to
say
when
it
has
been
steeped
sufficiently
in
running
water
and
half
dried
on
the
bank
it
is
brought
into
the
yard
and
arranged
in
little
upright
sheaves
which
with
their
stalks
divided
at
the
base
and
their
heads
bound
in
balls
bear
in
the
dusk
some
small
resemblance
to
a
long
procession
of
little
white
phantoms
standing
on
their
slender
legs
and
moving
noiselessly
along
the
wall
it
is
at
the
end
of
september
when
the
nights
are
still
warm
that
they
begin
to
beat
it
by
the
pale
light
of
the
moon
by
day
the
hemp
has
been
heated
in
the
oven
at
night
they
take
it
out
to
beat
it
while
it
is
still
hot
for
this
they
use
a
kind
of
horse
surmounted
by
a
wooden
lever
which
falls
into
grooves
and
breaks
the
plant
without
cutting
it
it
is
then
that
you
hear
in
the
night
that
sudden
sharp
noise
of
three
blows
in
quick
succession
then
there
is
silence
it
is
the
movement
of
the
arm
drawing
out
the
handful
of
hemp
to
break
it
in
a
fresh
spot
the
three
blows
begin
again
the
other
arm
works
the
lever
and
thus
it
goes
on
until
the
moon
is
hidden
by
the
early
streaks
of
dawn
as
the
work
continues
but
a
few
days
in
the
year
the
dogs
are
not
accustomed
to
it
and
yelp
their
plaintive
howls
toward
every
point
of
the
horizon
it
is
the
time
of
unwonted
and
mysterious
sounds
in
the
country
the
migrating
cranes
fly
so
high
that
by
day
they
are
scarcely
visible
by
night
they
are
only
heard
and
their
hoarse
wailing
voices
lost
in
the
clouds
sound
like
the
parting
cry
of
souls
in
torment
striving
to
find
the
road
to
heaven
yet
forced
by
an
unconquerable
fate
to
wander
near
the
earth
about
the
haunts
of
men
for
these
errant
birds
have
strange
uncertainties
and
many
a
mysterious
anxiety
in
the
course
of
their
airy
flight
sometimes
they
lose
the
wind
when
the
capricious
gusts
battle
or
come
and
go
in
the
upper
regions
when
this
confusion
comes
by
day
you
can
see
the
leader
of
the
file
fluttering
aimlessly
in
the
air
then
turn
about
and
take
his
place
at
the
tail
of
the
triangular
phalanx
while
a
skilful
manœuver
of
his
companions
forms
them
soon
in
good
order
behind
him
often
after
vain
efforts
the
exhausted
leader
relinquishes
the
guidance
of
the
caravan
another
comes
forward
tries
in
his
turn
and
yields
his
place
to
a
third
who
finds
the
breeze
and
continues
the
march
in
triumph
but
what
cries
what
reproaches
what
protests
what
wild
curses
or
anxious
questionings
are
exchanged
in
an
unknown
tongue
amongst
these
winged
pilgrims
sometimes
in
the
resonant
night
you
can
hear
these
sinister
noises
whirling
for
a
long
time
above
the
housetops
and
as
you
can
see
nothing
you
feel
despite
your
efforts
a
kind
of
dread
and
kindred
discomfort
until
the
sobbing
multitude
is
lost
in
boundless
space
there
are
other
noises
too
which
belong
to
this
time
of
year
and
which
sound
usually
in
the
orchards
gathering
the
fruit
is
not
yet
over
and
the
thousand
unaccustomed
cracklings
make
the
tree
seem
alive
a
branch
groans
as
it
bends
beneath
a
burden
which
has
reached
of
a
sudden
the
last
stage
of
growth
or
perhaps
an
apple
breaks
from
the
twig
and
falls
on
the
damp
earth
at
your
feet
with
a
dull
sound
then
you
hear
rush
by
brushing
the
branches
and
the
grass
a
creature
you
cannot
see
it
is
the
peasant
s
dog
that
prowling
and
uneasy
rover
at
once
impudent
and
cowardly
always
wandering
never
sleeping
ever
seeking
you
know
not
what
spying
upon
you
hiding
in
the
brush
and
taking
flight
at
the
sound
of
a
falling
apple
which
he
thinks
a
stone
that
you
are
throwing
at
him
it
is
during
those
nights
nights
misty
and
gray
that
the
hempdresser
tells
his
weird
stories
of
willo
thewisps
and
milkwhite
hares
of
souls
in
torment
and
wizards
changed
to
wolves
of
witches
vigils
at
the
crossroads
and
screechowls
prophetesses
of
the
graveyard
i
remember
passing
the
early
hours
of
such
a
night
while
the
hempdressing
was
going
on
and
the
pitiless
strokes
interrupting
the
dresser
s
story
at
its
most
awful
place
sent
icy
shivers
through
our
veins
and
often
too
the
good
man
continued
his
story
as
he
worked
and
four
or
five
words
were
lost
terrible
words
no
doubt
which
we
dared
not
make
him
repeat
and
whose
omission
added
a
mystery
yet
more
fearful
to
the
dark
mysteries
of
the
story
which
had
gone
before
it
was
in
vain
the
servants
warned
us
that
it
was
too
late
to
stay
without
doors
and
that
bedtime
had
sounded
for
us
long
since
they
too
were
dying
to
hear
more
and
then
with
what
terror
we
crossed
the
hamlet
on
our
way
home
how
deep
did
the
church
porch
appear
to
us
and
how
thick
and
black
the
shadows
of
the
old
trees
the
graveyard
we
dared
not
see
we
shut
our
eyes
tight
as
we
passed
it
but
no
more
than
the
sacristan
is
the
hempdresser
gifted
solely
with
the
desire
of
frightening
he
loves
to
make
people
laugh
he
is
sarcastic
and
sentimental
at
need
when
love
and
marriage
are
to
be
sung
it
is
he
who
collects
and
keeps
stored
in
his
memory
the
oldest
songs
and
who
transmits
them
to
posterity
and
so
it
is
he
who
acts
at
weddings
the
part
we
shall
see
him
play
at
the
presentation
of
little
marie
s
favors
illustration
ornament
ii
the
wedding
favors
when
all
the
guests
were
met
together
in
the
house
the
doors
and
windows
were
closed
with
the
utmost
care
even
the
garret
window
was
barricaded
boards
and
benches
logs
and
tables
were
placed
behind
every
entrance
just
as
if
the
inhabitants
were
making
ready
to
sustain
a
siege
and
within
these
fortifications
solemn
stillness
prevailed
until
at
a
distance
were
heard
songs
and
laughter
and
the
sounds
of
rustic
music
it
was
the
band
of
the
bridegroom
germain
at
the
head
followed
by
his
most
trusty
companions
and
by
the
gravedigger
relatives
friends
and
servants
who
formed
a
compact
and
merry
train
meanwhile
as
they
came
nearer
the
house
they
slackened
their
pace
held
a
council
of
war
and
became
silent
the
girls
shut
up
in
the
house
had
arranged
little
loopholes
at
the
windows
by
which
they
could
see
the
enemy
approach
and
deploy
in
battle
array
a
fine
cold
rain
was
falling
which
added
zest
to
the
situation
while
a
great
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
within
marie
wished
to
cut
short
the
inevitable
slowness
of
this
wellordered
siege
she
had
no
desire
to
see
her
lover
catch
cold
but
not
being
in
authority
she
had
to
take
an
ostensible
share
in
the
mischievous
cruelty
of
her
companions
when
the
two
armies
met
a
discharge
of
firearms
on
the
part
of
the
besiegers
set
all
the
dogs
in
the
neighborhood
to
barking
those
within
the
house
dashed
at
the
door
with
loud
yelps
thinking
that
the
attack
was
in
earnest
and
the
children
little
reassured
by
the
efforts
of
their
mothers
began
to
weep
and
to
tremble
the
whole
scene
was
played
so
well
that
a
stranger
would
have
been
deceived
and
would
have
made
his
preparations
to
fight
a
band
of
brigands
then
the
gravedigger
bard
and
orator
of
the
groom
took
his
stand
before
the
door
and
with
a
rueful
voice
exchanged
the
following
dialogue
with
the
hempdresser
who
was
stationed
above
the
same
door
the
gravedigger
ah
my
good
people
my
fellowtownsmen
for
the
love
of
heaven
open
the
door
the
hempdresser
who
are
you
and
what
right
have
you
to
call
us
your
dear
fellowtownsmen
we
don
t
know
you
the
gravedigger
we
are
worthy
folk
in
great
distress
don
t
be
afraid
of
us
my
friends
extend
us
your
hospitality
sleet
is
falling
our
poor
feet
are
frozen
and
our
journey
home
has
been
so
long
that
our
sabots
are
split
the
hempdresser
if
your
sabots
are
split
you
can
look
on
the
ground
you
will
find
very
soon
a
sprig
of
willow
to
make
some
arcelets
small
curved
blades
of
iron
which
are
fastened
on
split
sabots
to
hold
them
together
the
gravedigger
willow
arcelets
are
scarcely
strong
enough
you
are
making
fun
of
us
good
people
and
you
would
do
better
to
open
your
doors
we
can
see
a
splendid
fire
blazing
in
your
dwelling
the
spit
must
be
turning
and
we
can
make
merry
with
you
heart
and
belly
so
open
your
doors
to
poor
pilgrims
who
will
die
on
the
threshold
if
you
are
not
merciful
the
hempdresser
ah
ha
so
you
are
pilgrims
you
never
told
us
that
and
what
pilgrimage
do
you
come
from
may
i
ask
the
gravedigger
we
shall
tell
you
that
when
you
open
the
door
for
we
come
from
so
far
that
you
would
never
believe
it
the
hempdresser
open
the
door
to
you
i
rather
think
not
we
can
t
trust
you
tell
us
is
it
from
saint
sylvain
of
pouligny
that
you
come
the
gravedigger
we
have
been
at
saint
sylvain
of
pouligny
but
we
have
been
farther
still
the
hempdresser
then
you
have
been
as
far
as
saint
solange
the
gravedigger
at
saint
solange
we
have
been
sure
enough
but
we
have
been
farther
yet
the
hempdresser
you
are
lying
you
have
never
been
as
far
as
saint
solange
the
gravedigger
we
have
been
farther
for
now
we
are
come
from
saint
jacques
of
compostelle
the
hempdresser
what
absurdity
are
you
telling
us
we
don
t
know
that
parish
we
can
easily
see
that
you
are
bad
people
brigands
nobodies
and
liars
go
away
with
your
nonsense
we
are
on
our
guard
you
can
t
come
in
the
gravedigger
ah
my
poor
fellow
take
pity
on
us
we
are
not
pilgrims
as
you
have
guessed
but
we
are
unlucky
poachers
pursued
by
the
keepers
even
the
police
are
after
us
and
if
you
don
t
hide
us
in
your
hayloft
we
shall
be
taken
and
led
off
to
prison
the
hempdresser
and
who
will
prove
you
are
what
you
say
you
are
this
time
for
you
have
told
us
one
lie
already
that
you
can
t
maintain
the
gravedigger
if
you
will
let
us
in
we
shall
show
you
a
pretty
piece
of
game
we
have
killed
the
hempdresser
show
it
right
away
for
we
have
our
suspicions
the
gravedigger
all
right
open
the
door
or
a
window
to
let
us
pass
the
creature
in
the
hempdresser
oh
no
not
quite
so
foolish
i
am
looking
at
you
through
a
little
chink
and
i
can
see
neither
hunters
nor
game
amongst
you
here
an
oxdriver
a
thickset
fellow
of
herculean
strength
detached
himself
from
a
group
where
he
had
stood
unperceived
and
raised
toward
the
window
a
plucked
goose
spitted
on
a
strong
iron
bar
decorated
with
tufts
of
straw
and
ribbons
ho
ho
cried
the
hempdresser
after
cautiously
extending
an
arm
to
feel
the
roast
that
isn
t
a
quail
nor
a
partridge
it
isn
t
a
hare
nor
a
rabbit
it
s
something
like
a
goose
or
a
turkey
upon
my
word
you
re
clever
hunters
and
that
game
didn
t
make
you
run
very
far
move
on
you
rogues
we
know
all
your
lies
and
you
had
best
go
home
and
cook
your
supper
you
are
not
going
to
eat
ours
the
gravedigger
o
heavens
where
can
we
go
to
cook
our
game
it
is
very
little
for
so
many
as
we
and
besides
we
have
neither
place
nor
fire
at
this
time
every
door
is
closed
and
every
soul
asleep
you
are
the
only
people
who
are
celebrating
a
wedding
at
home
and
you
must
be
hardhearted
indeed
to
let
us
freeze
outside
once
again
good
people
open
the
door
we
shall
not
cost
you
anything
you
can
see
that
we
bring
our
own
meat
only
a
little
room
at
your
hearth
a
little
blaze
to
cook
with
and
we
shall
go
on
our
way
rejoicing
the
hempdresser
do
you
suppose
that
we
have
too
much
room
here
and
that
wood
is
bought
for
nothing
the
gravedigger
we
have
here
a
small
bundle
of
hay
to
make
the
fire
we
shall
be
satisfied
with
that
only
grant
us
leave
to
place
the
spit
across
your
fireplace
the
hempdresser
that
will
never
do
we
are
disgusted
and
don
t
pity
you
at
all
it
is
my
opinion
that
you
are
drunk
that
you
need
nothing
and
that
you
only
wish
to
come
in
and
steal
away
our
fire
and
our
daughters
the
gravedigger
since
you
won
t
listen
to
reason
we
shall
make
our
way
in
by
force
the
hempdresser
try
if
you
want
we
are
shut
in
well
enough
to
have
no
fear
of
you
and
since
you
are
impudent
fellows
we
shall
not
answer
you
again
thereupon
the
hempdresser
shut
the
garret
window
with
a
bang
and
came
down
into
the
room
below
by
a
stepladder
then
he
took
the
bride
by
the
hand
the
young
people
of
both
sexes
followed
and
they
all
began
to
sing
and
chatter
merrily
while
the
matrons
sang
in
piercing
voices
and
shrieked
with
laughter
in
derision
and
bravado
at
those
without
who
were
attempting
an
attack
the
besiegers
on
their
side
made
a
great
hubbub
they
discharged
their
pistols
at
the
doors
made
the
dogs
growl
whacked
the
walls
shook
the
blinds
and
uttered
frightful
shrieks
in
short
there
was
such
a
pandemonium
that
nobody
could
hear
and
such
a
cloud
of
dust
that
nobody
could
see
and
yet
this
attack
was
all
a
sham
the
time
had
not
come
for
breaking
through
the
etiquette
if
in
prowling
about
anybody
were
to
find
an
unguarded
aperture
or
any
opening
whatsoever
he
might
try
to
slip
in
unobserved
and
then
if
the
carrier
of
the
spit
succeeded
in
placing
his
roast
before
the
fire
and
thus
prove
the
capture
of
the
hearth
the
comedy
was
over
and
the
bridegroom
had
conquered
the
entrances
of
the
house
however
were
not
numerous
enough
for
any
to
be
neglected
in
the
customary
precautions
and
nobody
might
use
violence
before
the
moment
fixed
for
the
struggle
when
they
were
weary
of
dancing
and
screams
the
hempdresser
began
to
think
of
capitulation
he
went
up
to
his
window
opened
it
with
precaution
and
greeted
the
baffled
assailants
with
a
burst
of
laughter
well
my
boys
said
he
you
look
very
sheepfaced
you
thought
there
was
nothing
easier
than
to
come
in
and
you
see
that
our
defense
is
good
but
we
are
beginning
to
have
pity
on
you
if
you
will
submit
and
accept
our
conditions
the
gravedigger
speak
good
people
tell
us
what
we
must
do
to
approach
your
hearth
the
hempdresser
you
must
sing
my
friends
but
sing
a
song
we
don
t
knowone
that
we
can
t
answer
by
a
better
that
s
not
hard
to
do
answered
the
gravedigger
and
he
thundered
in
a
powerful
voice
six
months
ago
twas
in
the
spring
i
wandered
through
the
sprouting
grass
answered
the
hempdresser
in
a
slightly
hoarse
but
terrible
voice
you
must
be
jesting
my
poor
friends
singing
us
such
timeworn
songs
you
see
very
well
that
we
can
stop
you
at
the
first
word
she
was
a
prince
s
daughter
right
gladly
would
she
wed
answered
the
hempdresser
come
move
on
to
the
next
we
know
that
a
little
too
well
the
gravedigger
how
do
you
like
this
one
as
i
was
journeying
home
from
nantes
the
hempdresser
weary
oh
weary
was
i
was
i
that
dates
from
my
grandmother
s
time
let
s
have
another
the
gravedigger
one
day
i
went
awalking
the
hempdresser
along
a
lovely
wood
that
one
is
too
stupid
our
little
children
wouldn
t
take
the
trouble
to
answer
you
what
are
these
all
you
know
the
gravedigger
oh
we
shall
sing
you
so
many
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
hear
them
all
in
this
way
a
full
hour
passed
as
the
two
antagonists
were
champions
of
the
country
round
in
the
matter
of
songs
and
as
their
store
seemed
inexhaustible
the
contest
might
last
all
night
with
ease
all
the
more
because
the
hempdresser
with
a
touch
of
malice
allowed
several
ballads
of
ten
twenty
or
thirty
couplets
to
be
sung
through
feigning
by
his
silence
to
admit
his
defeat
then
the
bridegroom
s
camp
rejoiced
and
sang
aloud
in
chorus
and
thought
that
this
time
the
foe
was
worsted
but
at
the
first
line
of
the
last
couplet
they
heard
the
hoarse
croaking
of
the
old
hempdresser
bellow
forth
the
second
rhyme
then
he
cried
you
need
not
tire
yourselves
by
singing
such
a
long
one
my
childrenwe
know
that
one
to
our
fingertips
once
or
twice
however
the
hempdresser
made
a
wry
face
contracted
his
brow
and
turned
toward
the
expectant
housewives
with
a
baffled
air
the
gravedigger
was
singing
something
so
old
that
his
adversary
had
forgotten
it
or
perhaps
had
never
even
heard
it
but
instantly
the
good
gossips
chanted
the
victorious
refrain
through
their
noses
with
voices
shrill
as
a
seamew
s
and
the
gravedigger
forced
to
surrender
went
on
to
fresh
attempts
it
would
have
taken
too
long
to
wait
for
a
decision
of
the
victory
the
bride
s
party
declared
itself
disposed
to
be
merciful
provided
that
the
bride
were
given
a
present
worthy
of
her
then
began
the
song
of
the
favors
to
a
tune
solemn
as
a
church
chant
the
men
without
sang
together
in
bass
voices
open
the
door
true
love
open
the
door
i
have
presents
for
you
love
oh
say
not
adieu
love
to
this
the
women
answered
from
within
in
falsetto
with
mournful
voices
my
father
is
sorry
my
mother
is
sad
and
i
am
a
maiden
too
kind
by
far
at
such
an
hour
my
gate
to
unbar
the
men
took
up
the
first
verse
as
far
as
the
fourth
line
and
modified
it
thus
and
a
handkerchief
new
love
but
on
behalf
of
the
bride
the
women
answered
in
the
same
way
as
at
first
for
twenty
couplets
at
least
the
men
enumerated
all
the
weddingpresents
always
mentioning
something
new
in
the
last
line
a
handsome
apron
pretty
ribbons
a
cloth
dress
laces
a
golden
cross
and
even
a
hundred
pins
to
complete
the
modest
list
of
weddingpresents
the
refusal
of
the
women
could
not
be
shaken
but
at
length
the
men
decided
to
speak
of
a
good
husband
too
love
and
the
women
answered
turning
toward
the
bride
and
singing
in
unison
with
the
men
open
the
door
true
love
open
the
door
here
s
a
sweetheart
for
you

iii
the
wedding
immediately
the
hempdresser
drew
back
the
wooden
bolt
which
barred
the
door
within
at
this
time
it
was
still
the
only
fastening
known
in
most
of
the
dwellings
of
our
hamlet
the
groom
s
band
burst
into
the
bride
s
house
but
not
without
a
struggle
for
the
young
men
quartered
within
and
even
the
old
hempdresser
and
the
gossips
made
it
their
duty
to
defend
the
hearth
the
spitbearer
upheld
by
his
supporters
had
to
plant
the
roast
before
the
fireplace
it
was
a
regular
battle
although
people
abstained
from
striking
and
there
was
no
anger
shown
in
this
struggle
but
everybody
was
pushing
and
shoving
so
hard
and
there
was
so
much
playful
pride
in
this
display
of
muscular
strength
that
the
results
might
well
have
been
serious
although
they
did
not
appear
so
across
the
laughs
and
songs
the
poor
old
hempdresser
fighting
like
a
lion
was
pinned
to
the
wall
and
squeezed
by
the
crowd
until
his
breath
almost
left
him
more
than
one
champion
was
upset
and
trodden
under
foot
involuntarily
more
than
one
hand
jammed
against
the
spit
was
covered
with
blood
these
games
are
dangerous
and
latterly
the
accidents
have
been
so
severe
that
our
peasants
have
determined
to
allow
the
ceremony
of
the
favors
to
fall
into
disuse
i
believe
we
saw
the
last
at
the
marriage
of
françois
meillant
although
there
was
no
real
struggle
on
that
occasion
the
battle
was
earnest
enough
however
at
germain
s
wedding
it
was
a
point
of
honor
on
one
side
to
invade
on
the
other
to
defend
mother
guillette
s
hearth
the
great
spit
was
twisted
like
a
screw
beneath
the
strong
fists
which
fought
for
it
a
pistolshot
set
fire
to
a
small
quantity
of
hemp
arranged
in
sheaves
and
laid
on
a
wicker
shelf
near
the
ceiling
this
incident
created
a
diversion
and
while
some
of
the
company
crowded
about
to
extinguish
the
sparks
the
gravedigger
who
had
climbed
unbeknown
into
the
garret
came
down
the
chimney
and
seized
the
spit
at
the
very
moment
when
the
oxdriver
who
was
defending
it
near
the
hearth
raised
it
above
his
head
to
prevent
it
from
being
torn
away
some
time
before
the
attack
the
women
had
taken
the
precaution
to
put
out
the
fire
lest
in
the
struggle
somebody
should
fall
in
and
get
burned
the
jocular
gravedigger
in
league
with
the
oxdriver
grasped
the
trophy
and
tossed
it
easily
across
the
andirons
it
was
done
nobody
might
interfere
the
gravedigger
sprang
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
lighted
a
few
wisps
of
straw
which
he
placed
about
the
spit
under
pretense
of
cooking
the
roast
for
the
goose
was
in
pieces
and
the
floor
was
strewn
with
its
scattered
fragments
then
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
and
much
boastful
dispute
everybody
showed
the
marks
of
the
blows
he
had
received
and
as
it
was
often
a
friend
s
hand
that
had
struck
them
there
was
no
word
of
complaint
nor
of
quarreling
the
hempdresser
half
flattened
out
kept
rubbing
the
small
of
his
back
and
saying
that
although
it
made
small
difference
to
him
he
protested
against
the
ruse
of
his
friend
the
gravedigger
and
that
if
he
had
not
been
half
dead
the
hearth
had
never
been
captured
so
easily
the
women
swept
the
floor
and
order
was
restored
the
table
was
covered
with
jugs
of
new
wine
when
the
contestants
had
drunk
together
and
taken
breath
the
bridegroom
was
led
to
the
middle
of
the
chamber
and
armed
with
a
wand
he
was
obliged
to
submit
to
a
fresh
trial
during
the
struggle
the
bride
and
three
of
her
companions
had
been
hidden
by
her
mother
godmother
and
aunts
who
had
made
the
four
girls
sit
down
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
while
they
covered
them
with
a
large
white
cloth
three
friends
of
marie
s
height
with
caps
of
a
uniform
size
were
chosen
so
that
when
they
were
enveloped
from
head
to
toe
by
the
cloth
it
was
impossible
to
tell
them
apart
the
bridegroom
might
not
touch
them
except
with
the
tip
of
his
staff
and
then
merely
to
designate
which
he
thought
to
be
his
wife
they
allowed
him
time
enough
to
make
an
examination
with
no
other
help
than
his
eyes
afforded
and
the
women
placed
on
either
side
kept
zealous
watch
lest
cheating
should
occur
should
he
guess
wrong
he
might
not
dance
with
his
bride
but
only
with
her
he
had
chosen
by
mistake
when
germain
stood
in
front
of
these
ghosts
wrapped
in
the
same
shroud
he
feared
he
should
make
a
wrong
choice
and
in
truth
that
had
happened
to
many
another
so
carefully
and
conscientiously
were
the
precautions
made
his
heart
beat
loud
little
marie
did
her
best
to
breathe
hard
and
shake
the
cloth
a
little
but
her
malicious
companions
followed
her
example
and
kept
poking
the
cloth
with
their
fingers
so
that
there
were
as
many
mysterious
signals
as
there
were
girls
beneath
the
canopy
the
square
headdresses
upheld
the
cloth
so
evenly
that
it
was
impossible
to
discern
the
contour
of
a
brow
outlined
by
its
folds
after
ten
minutes
hesitation
germain
shut
his
eyes
commended
his
soul
to
god
and
stretched
out
the
wand
at
random
it
touched
the
forehead
of
little
marie
who
cast
the
cloth
from
her
and
shouted
with
triumph
then
it
was
his
right
to
kiss
her
and
lifting
her
in
his
strong
arms
he
bore
her
to
the
middle
of
the
room
where
together
they
opened
the
dance
which
lasted
until
two
in
the
morning
the
company
separated
to
meet
again
at
eight
as
many
people
had
come
from
the
country
round
and
as
there
were
not
beds
enough
for
everybody
each
of
the
village
maidens
took
to
her
bed
two
or
three
other
girls
while
the
men
spread
themselves
pellmell
on
the
hay
in
the
barnloft
you
can
imagine
well
that
they
had
little
sleep
for
they
did
nothing
but
wrestle
and
joke
and
tell
foolish
stories
properly
there
were
three
sleepless
nights
at
weddings
and
these
we
cannot
regret
at
the
time
appointed
for
departure
when
they
had
partaken
of
milksoup
seasoned
with
a
strong
dose
of
pepper

stimulate

from

to
receive

marriage
blessing
it
was
cool
and
pleasant
weather
but
the
roads
were
in
such
wretched
condition
that
everybody
was
on
horseback
and
each
man
took
a

was
seated
in
a
small
cart
with
germain
s
three
children
and
the
fiddlers
they
led
the
march
to
the
sound
of
their
instruments
petitpierre
was
so
handsome
that
his
old
grandmother
was
pride
itself
but
the
eager
child
did
not
stay
long
at
her
side
during
a
moment
s
halt
made
on
the
journey
before
passing
through
a
difficult
piece
of
road
he
slipped
away
and
ran
to
beg
his
father
to
carry
him
in
front
on
the
gray
no
no
replied
germain
that
will
call
forth
some
disagreeable
joke
we
mustn
t
do
it
it
s
little
that
i
care
what
the
people
of
saint
chartier
say
said
little
marie
take
him
up
germain
please
do
i
shall
be
prouder
of
him
than
i
am
of
my
weddinggown
germain
yielded
and
the
pretty
trio
darted
into
the
crowd
borne
by
the
triumphant
gallop
of
the
gray
and
so
it
was
the
people
of
saint
chartier
although
they
were
very
sarcastic
and
somewhat
disdainful
of
the
neighboring
parishes
which
had
been
annexed
to
theirs
never
thought
of
laughing
when
they
saw
such
a
handsome
husband
such
a
lovely
wife
and
a
child
that
a
king
s
wife
might
court
petitpierre
was
all
dressed
in
light
blue
cloth
with
a
smart
red
waistcoat
so
short
that
it
descended
scarcely
below
his
chin
the
village
tailor
had
fitted
his
armholes
so
tight
that
he
could
not
bring
his
two
little
hands
together
but
oh
how
proud
he
was
he
wore
a
round
hat
with
a
blackandgold
cord
and
a
peacock
s
plume
which
stuck
out
proudly
from
a
tuft
of
guinea
feathers
a
bunch
of
flowers
bigger
than
his
head
covered
his
shoulder
and
ribbons
fluttered
to
his
feet
the
hempdresser
who
was
also
the
barber
and
hairdresser
of
the
district
had
cut
his
hair
evenly
by
covering
his
head
with
a
bowl
and
clipping
off
the
protruding
locks
an
infallible
method
for
guiding
the
shears
thus
arrayed
the
poor
child
was
less
poetic
certainly
than
with
his
curls
streaming
in
the
wind
and
his
saint
john
baptist
s
sheepskin
about
him
but
he
knew
nothing
of
this
and
everybody
admired
him
and
said
that
he
had
quite
the
air
of
a
little
man
his
beauty
triumphed
over
everything
for
what
is
there
over
which
the
exceeding
beauty
of
childhood
could
not
triumph
his
little
sister
solange
had
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
a
peasant
s
cap
in
place
of
the
calico
hood
which
little
girls
wear
until
they
are
two
or
three
years
old
and
what
a
cap
it
was
longer
and
larger
than
the
poor
little
thing
s
whole
body
how
beautiful
she
thought
it
she
dared
not
even
turn
her
head
so
she
kept
quite
still
and
thought
the
people
would
take
her
for
the
bride
as
for
little
sylvain
he
was
still
in
long
clothes
and
fast
asleep
on
his
grandmother
s
knees
he
did
not
even
know
what
a
wedding
was
germain
looked
at
his
children
tenderly
and
when
they
reached
the
town
hall
he
said
to
his
bride
marie
i
have
come
here
with
a
happier
heart
than
i
had
the
day
when
i
brought
you
home
from
the
forest
of
chanteloube
thinking
that
you
could
never
love
me
i
took
you
in
my
arms
to
put
you
on
the
ground
as
i
do
here
but
i
thought
that
never
again
should
we
be
mounted
on
the
good
gray
with
the
child
on
our
knees
i
love
you
so
dearly
i
love
these
little
creatures
so
dearly
i
am
so
happy
that
you
love
me
and
that
you
love
them
and
that
my
family
love
you
and
i
love
your
mother
so
well
and
all
my
friends
so
well
and
everybody
else
so
well
today
that
i
wish
i
had
three
or
four
hearts
to
fill
all
of
them
for
surely
one
is
too
small
to
hold
so
much
love
and
so
much
happiness
it
almost
makes
my
stomach
ache
there
was
a
crowd
at
the
door
of
the
town
hall
and
another
at
the
church
to
see
the
pretty
bride
why
should
we
not
tell
about
her
dress
it
became
her
so
well
her
muslin
cap
without
spot
and
covered
with
embroidery
had
lappets
trimmed
with
lace
at
that
time
peasant
women
never
allowed
a
single
lock
to
be
seen
and
although
they
conceal
beneath
their
caps
splendid
coils
of
hair
tied
up
with
tape
to
hold
the
coif
in
place
even
today
it
would
be
thought
a
scandal
and
a
shame
for
them
to
show
themselves
bareheaded
to
men
nowadays
however
they
allow
a
slender
braid
to
appear
over
their
foreheads
and
this
improves
their
appearance
very
much
yet
i
regret
the
classic
headdress
of
my
time
its
spotless
laces
next
the
bare
skin
gave
an
effect
of
pristine
purity
which
seemed
to
me
very
solemn
and
when
a
face
looked
beautiful
thus
it
was
with
a
beauty
of
which
nothing
can
express
the
charm
and
unaffected
majesty
little
marie
wore
her
cap
thus
and
her
forehead
was
so
white
and
so
pure
that
it
defied
the
whiteness
of
linen
to
cast
it
in
the
shade
although
she
had
not
closed
an
eye
the
night
before
the
morning
air
and
yet
more
the
joy
within
of
a
soul
pure
as
the
heaven
and
more
than
all
a
small
secret
flame
guarded
with
the
modesty
of
girlhood
caused
a
bloom
to
mount
to
her
cheeks
delicate
as
the
peachblossom
in
the
first
beams
of
an
april
sun
her
white
scarf
modestly
crossed
over
her
breast
left
visible
only
the
soft
curves
of
a
neck
rounded
like
a
turtledove
s
her
homemade
cloth
gown
of
myrtlegreen
outlined
her
pretty
figure
which
looked
already
perfect
yet
which
must
still
grow
and
develop
for
she
was
but
seventeen
she
wore
an
apron
of
violet
silk
with
the
bib
our
peasant
women
were
so
foolish
as
to
suppress
which
added
so
much
elegance
and
decency
to
the
breast
nowadays
they
display
their
scarfs
more
proudly
but
there
is
no
longer
in
their
dress
that
delicate
flower
of
the
purity
of
long
ago
which
made
them
look
like
holbein
s
virgins
they
are
more
forward
and
more
profuse
in
their
courtesies
the
good
old
custom
used
to
be
a
kind
of
staid
reserve
which
made
their
rare
smile
deeper
and
more
ideal
during
the
offertory
after
the
fashion
of
the
day
germain
placed
the
thirteen
that
is
to
say
thirteen
pieces
of
silverin
his
bride
s
hand
he
slipped
over
her
finger
a
silver
ring
of
a
form
unchanged
for
centuries
but
which
is
replaced
for
henceforth
by
the
golden
weddingring
as
they
walked
out
of
church
marie
said
in
a
low
voice
is
this
really
the
ring
i
wanted
is
it
the
one
i
asked
you
for
germain
yes
answered
he
my
catherine
wore
it
on
her
finger
when
she
died
there
is
but
one
ring
for
both
my
weddings
thank
you
germain
said
the
young
woman
in
a
serious
and
impressive
tone
i
shall
die
with
it
on
and
if
i
go
before
you
you
must
keep
it
for
the
marriage
of
your
little
solange
illustration
ornament
iv
the
cabbage
they
mounted
and
returned
very
quickly
to
belair
the
feast
was
bountiful
and
mingled
with
songs
and
dances
it
lasted
until
midnight
for
fourteen
hours
the
old
people
did
not
leave
the
table
the
gravedigger
did
the
cooking
and
did
it
very
well
he
was
celebrated
for
this
and
he
would
leave
his
fire
to
come
in
and
dance
and
sing
before
and
after
every
course
and
yet
this
poor
father
bontemps
was
epileptic
who
would
have
thought
it
he
was
fresh
and
strong
and
merry
as
a
young
man
one
day
we
found
him
in
a
ditch
struck
down
by
his
malady
at
nightfall
we
carried
him
home
with
us
in
a
wheelbarrow
and
we
spent
all
night
in
caring
for
him
three
days
afterward
he
was
at
a
wedding
singing
like
a
thrush
jumping
like
a
kid
and
bustling
about
after
his
old
fashion
when
he
left
a
marriage
he
would
go
to
dig
a
grave
and
nail
up
a
coffin
then
he
would
become
very
grave
and
though
nothing
of
this
appeared
in
his
gay
humor
it
left
a
melancholy
impression
which
hastened
the
return
of
his
attacks
his
wife
was
paralyzed
and
had
not
stirred
from
her
chair
for
twenty
years
his
mother
is
living
yet
at
a
hundred
and
forty
but
he
poor
man
so
happy
and
good
and
amusing
was
killed
last
year
by
falling
from
his
loft
to
the
sidewalk
doubtless
he
died
a
victim
to
a
fatal
attack
of
his
disease
and
as
was
his
habit
had
hidden
in
the
hay
so
as
not
to
frighten
and
distress
his
family
in
this
tragic
manner
he
ended
a
life
strange
as
his
dispositiona
medley
of
things
sad
and
mad
awful
and
gay
and
in
the
midst
of
all
his
heart
was
ever
good
and
his
nature
kind
now
we
come
to
the
third
day
of
the
wedding
the
most
curious
of
all
which
is
kept
today
in
all
its
vigor
we
shall
not
speak
of
the
roast
which
they
carry
to
the
bridal
bed
it
is
a
very
silly
custom
and
hurts
the
selfrespect
of
the
bride
while
it
tends
to
ruin
the
modesty
of
the
attendant
girls
besides
i
believe
that
it
is
practised
in
all
the
provinces
and
does
not
belong
peculiarly
to
our
own
just
as
the
ceremony
of
the
wedding
favors
is
a
symbol
that
the
heart
and
home
of
the
bride
are
won
that
of
the
cabbage
is
a
symbol
of
the
fruitfulness
of
marriage
when
breakfast
is
over
on
the
day
after
the
wedding
this
fantastic
representation
begins
originally
of
gallic
derivation
it
has
passed
through
primitive
christianity
and
little
by
little
it
has
become
a
kind
of
mystery
or
droll
moralityplay
of
the
middle
ages
two
boys
the
merriest
and
most
intelligent
of
the
company
disappear
from
breakfast
and
after
costuming
themselves
return
escorted
by
dogs
children
and
pistolshots
they
represent
a
pair
of
beggarshusband
and
wifedressed
in
rags
the
husband
is
the
filthier
of
the
two
it
is
vice
which
has
brought
him
so
low
the
wife
is
unhappy
and
degraded
only
through
the
misdeeds
of
her
husband
they
are
called
the
gardener
and
the
gardener
s
wife
and
they
pretend
it
is
their
duty
to
guard
and
care
for
the
sacred
cabbage
the
husband
has
several
names
each
with
a
meaning
sometimes
they
call
him
the
scarecrow
because
his
head
is
covered
with
straw
or
hemp
and
because
his
legs
and
a
portion
of
his
body
are
surrounded
with
straw
to
hide
his
nakedness
ill
concealed
by
his
rags
he
has
also
a
great
belly
or
hump
constructed
of
straw
or
hay
underneath
his
blouse
then
he
is
known
as
the
ragamuffin
on
account
of
his
covering
of
rags
lastly
he
is
termed
the
infidel
and
this
is
most
significant
of
all
because
by
his
cynicism
and
his
debauchery
he
is
supposed
to
typify
the
opposite
of
every
christian
virtue
he
comes
with
his
face
all
smeared
with
soot
and
the
lees
of
wine
and
sometimes
made
yet
more
hideous
by
a
grotesque
mask
an
earthenware
cup
notched
and
broken
or
an
old
sabot
attached
to
his
girdle
by
a
cord
shows
that
he
has
come
to
beg
for
alms
of
wine
nobody
refuses
him
and
he
pretends
to
drink
then
he
pours
the
wine
on
the
ground
by
way
of
libation
at
every
step
he
falls
rolls
in
the
mud
and
feigns
to
be
a
prey
to
the
most
shameful
drunkenness
his
poor
wife
runs
after
him
picks
him
up
calls
for
help
arranges
his
hempen
locks
which
straggle
forth
in
unkempt
wisps
from
beneath
his
filthy
hat
sheds
tears
over
her
husband
s
degradation
and
pours
forth
pathetic
reproaches
wretched
man
she
cries
see
the
misery
to
which
your
wickedness
has
brought
us
i
have
to
spend
all
my
time
sewing
and
working
for
you
mending
your
clothes
you
tear
and
bedraggle
yourself
incessantly
you
have
eaten
up
all
my
little
property
our
six
children
lie
on
straw
and
we
are
living
in
a
stable
with
the
beasts
here
we
are
forced
to
beg
for
alms
and
besides
you
are
so
ugly
and
vile
and
despicable
that
very
soon
they
will
be
tossing
us
bread
as
if
we
were
dogs
ah
my
poor
people
take
pity
on
us
take
pity
on
me
i
haven
t
deserved
my
lot
and
never
had
woman
a
more
dirty
and
detestable
husband
help
me
to
pick
him
up
else
the
wagons
will
run
over
him
as
they
run
over
broken
bottles
and
i
shall
be
a
widow
and
that
will
end
by
killing
me
with
grief
though
all
the
world
says
it
would
be
an
excellent
riddance
for
me
such
is
the
part
of
the
gardener
s
wife
and
her
continued
lamentations
last
during
the
entire
play
for
it
is
a
genuine
spontaneous
comedy
acted
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
in
the
open
air
along
the
roads
and
across
the
fields
aided
by
every
chance
occurrence
that
presents
itself
everybody
shares
in
the
acting
people
within
the
weddingparty
and
people
without
wayfarers
and
dwellers
in
houses
for
three
or
four
hours
of
the
day
as
we
shall
see
the
theme
is
always
the
same
but
the
variations
are
infinite
and
it
is
here
that
we
can
see
the
instinct
of
mimicry
the
abundance
of
droll
ideas
the
fluency
the
wit
at
repartee
and
even
the
natural
eloquence
of
our
peasants
the
rôle
of
gardener
s
wife
is
intrusted
commonly
to
a
slender
man
beardless
and
fresh
of
face
who
can
give
a
great
appearance
of
truth
to
his
personification
and
plays
the
burlesque
despair
naturally
enough
to
make
people
sad
and
glad
at
once
as
they
are
in
real
life
these
thin
beardless
men
are
not
rare
among
us
and
strangely
enough
they
are
sometimes
most
remarkable
for
their
muscular
strength
when
the
wife
s
misfortunes
have
been
explained
the
young
men
of
the
company
try
to
persuade
her
to
leave
her
drunken
husband
and
to
amuse
herself
with
them
they
offer
her
their
arms
and
drag
her
away
little
by
little
she
gives
way
her
spirits
rise
and
she
begins
to
run
about
first
with
one
and
then
with
another
and
grows
more
scandalous
in
her
behavior
a
fresh
morality
the
illconduct
of
the
husband
excites
and
aggravates
the
evil
in
the
wife
then
the
infidel
wakes
from
his
drunkenness
he
looks
about
for
his
companion
arms
himself
with
a
rope
and
a
stick
and
rushes
after
her
they
make
him
run
they
hide
they
pass
the
wife
from
one
to
another
they
try
to
divert
her
attention
and
to
deceive
her
jealous
spouse
his
friends
try
to
get
him
drunk
at
length
he
catches
his
unfaithful
wife
and
wishes
to
beat
her
what
is
truest
and
most
carefully
portrayed
in
this
play
is
that
the
jealous
husband
never
attacks
the
men
who
carry
off
his
wife
he
is
very
polite
and
prudent
with
them
and
wishes
only
to
take
vengeance
on
the
sinning
woman
because
she
is
supposed
to
be
too
feeble
to
offer
resistance
at
the
moment
however
when
he
raises
his
stick
and
prepares
his
cord
to
strike
the
delinquent
all
the
men
in
the
party
interpose
and
throw
themselves
between
husband
and
wife
don
t
strike
her
never
strike
your
wife
is
the
formula
repeated
to
satiety
during
these
scenes
they
disarm
the
husband
and
force
him
to
pardon
and
to
kiss
his
wife
and
soon
he
pretends
to
love
her
better
than
ever
he
walks
along
his
arm
linked
in
hers
singing
and
dancing
until
in
a
new
access
of
drunkenness
he
rolls
upon
the
ground
and
then
begin
all
over
again
the
lamentations
of
the
wife
her
discouragements
her
pretended
unfaithfulness
her
husband
s
jealousy
the
interference
of
the
neighbors
and
the
reconciliation
in
all
this
there
is
a
simple
and
even
coarse
lesson
which
though
it
savors
strongly
of
its
middleage
origin
does
not
fail
to
fix
its
impression
if
not
on
the
married
folk
who
are
too
loving
or
too
sensible
to
have
need
of
it
at
least
upon
the
children
and
the
young
people
the
infidel
racing
after
young
girls
and
pretending
to
wish
to
kiss
them
frightens
and
disgusts
them
to
such
a
degree
that
they
fly
in
unaffected
terror
his
dirty
face
and
his
great
stick
harmless
as
it
is
make
the
children
shriek
aloud
it
is
the
comedy
of
customs
in
their
most
elementary
but
their
most
striking
state
when
this
farce
is
well
under
way
people
make
ready
to
hunt
for
the
cabbage
they
bring
a
stretcher
and
place
upon
it
the
infidel
armed
with
a
spade
a
cord
and
a
large
basket
four
powerful
men
raise
him
on
their
shoulders
his
wife
follows
on
foot
and
after
her
come
the
elders
in
a
body
with
serious
and
thoughtful
looks
then
the
weddingmarch
begins
by
couples
to
a
step
tuned
to
music
pistolshots
begin
anew
and
dogs
bark
louder
than
ever
at
the
sight
of
the
filthy
infidel
borne
aloft
in
triumph
the
children
swing
incense
in
derision
with
sabots
fastened
at
the
end
of
a
cord
but
why
this
ovation
to
an
object
so
repulsive
they
are
marching
to
the
capture
of
the
sacred
cabbage
emblem
of
the
fruitfulness
of
marriage
and
it
is
this
drunkard
alone
who
can
bear
the
symbolic
plant
in
his
hand
doubtless
there
is
in
it
a
prechristian
mystery
which
recalls
the
saturnalian
feasts
or
some
rout
of
the
bacchanals
perhaps
this
infidel
who
is
at
the
same
time
preeminently
a
gardener
is
none
other
than
priapus
himself
god
of
gardens
and
of
drunkenness
a
divinity
who
must
have
been
pure
and
serious
in
his
origin
as
is
the
mystery
of
birth
but
who
has
been
degraded
bit
by
bit
through
license
of
manners
and
distraction
of
thought
however
this
may
be
the
triumphal
procession
arrives
at
the
bride
s
house
and
enters
the
garden
then
they
select
the
choicest
cabbage
and
this
is
not
done
very
quickly
for
the
old
people
keep
consulting
and
disputing
interminably
each
one
pleading
for
the
cabbage
he
thinks
most
suitable
they
put
it
to
vote
and
when
the
choice
is
made
the
gardener
fastens
his
cord
to
the
stalk
and
moves
away
as
far
as
the
size
of
the
garden
permits
the
gardener
s
wife
takes
care
that
the
sacred
vegetable
shall
not
be
hurt
in
its
fall
the
wits
of
the
wedding
the
hempdresser
the
gravedigger
the
carpenter
and
the
sabotmaker
form
a
ring
about
the
cabbage
for
men
who
do
not
till
the
soil
but
pass
their
lives
in
other
people
s
houses
are
thought
to
be
and
are
really
wittier
and
more
talkative
than
simple
farmhands
one
digs
with
a
spade
a
ditch
deep
enough
to
uproot
an
oak
another
places
on
his
nose
a
pair
of
wooden
or
cardboard
spectacles
he
fulfils
the
duties
of
engineer
walks
up
and
down
constructs
a
plan
stares
at
the
workmen
through
his
glasses
plays
the
pedant
cries
out
that
everything
will
be
spoiled
has
the
work
stopped
and
begun
afresh
as
his
fancy
directs
and
makes
the
whole
performance
as
long
and
ridiculous
as
he
can
this
is
an
addition
to
the
formula
of
an
ancient
ceremony
held
in
mockery
of
theorists
in
general
for
peasants
despise
them
royally
or
from
hatred
of
the
surveyors
who
decide
boundaries
and
regulate
taxes
or
of
the
workmen
employed
on
bridges
and
causeways
who
transform
commons
into
highways
and
suppress
old
abuses
which
the
peasants
love
be
this
as
it
may
this
character
in
the
comedy
is
called
the
geometrician
and
does
his
best
to
make
himself
unbearable
to
those
who
are
toiling
with
pickaxe
and
shovel
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
spent
in
mummery
and
difficulties
raised
in
order
to
avoid
cutting
the
roots
and
to
transplant
the
cabbage
without
injury
while
shovelfuls
of
dirt
are
tossed
into
the
faces
of
the
onlookersso
much
the
worse
for
him
who
does
not
retreat
in
time
for
were
he
bishop
or
prince
he
must
receive
the
baptism
of
earththe
infidel
pulls
the
rope
the
infidel
s
wife
holds
her
apron
and
the
cabbage
falls
majestically
amidst
the
applause
of
the
spectators
then
a
basket
is
brought
and
the
infidel
pair
plant
the
cabbage
therein
with
every
care
and
precaution
they
surround
it
with
fresh
earth
and
support
it
with
sticks
and
strings
such
as
city
florists
use
for
their
splendid
potted
camellias
they
fix
red
apples
to
the
points
of
the
sticks
and
twist
sprigs
of
thyme
sage
and
laurel
all
about
them
they
bedeck
the
whole
with
ribbons
and
streamers
they
place
the
trophy
upon
the
stretcher
with
the
infidel
whose
duty
it
is
to
maintain
its
equilibrium
and
preserve
it
from
harm
and
at
length
they
move
away
from
the
garden
in
good
order
and
in
marching
step
but
when
they
are
about
to
pass
the
gate
and
again
when
they
enter
the
yard
of
the
bridegroom
s
house
an
imaginary
obstacle
blocks
the
way
the
bearers
of
the
burden
stagger
utter
loud
cries
retreat
advance
once
more
and
as
though
crushed
by
a
resistless
force
they
pretend
to
sink
beneath
its
weight
while
this
is
going
on
the
bystanders
shout
loudly
exciting
and
steadying
this
human
team
slowly
slowly
my
child
there
there
courage
look
out
be
patient
lower
your
head
the
door
is
too
low
close
up
it
s
too
narrow
a
little
more
to
the
left
now
to
the
right
on
with
you
don
t
be
afraid
you
re
almost
there
thus
it
is
that
in
years
of
plentiful
harvest
the
oxcart
loaded
to
overflowing
with
hay
or
corn
is
too
broad
or
too
high
to
enter
the
barn
door
thus
it
is
that
the
driver
shouts
at
the
strong
beasts
to
restrain
them
or
to
urge
them
on
thus
it
is
that
with
skill
and
mighty
efforts
they
force
this
mountain
of
riches
beneath
the
rustic
arch
of
triumph
it
is
above
all
the
last
load
called
the
cart
of
sheaves
which
requires
these
precautions
for
this
is
a
rural
festival
and
the
last
sheaf
lifted
from
the
last
furrow
is
placed
on
the
top
of
the
cartload
ornamented
with
ribbons
and
flowers
while
the
foreheads
of
the
oxen
and
the
whip
of
the
driver
are
decorated
also
the
triumphant
and
toilsome
entry
of
the
cabbage
into
the
house
is
a
symbol
of
the
prosperity
and
fruitfulness
it
represents
safe
within
the
bridegroom
s
yard
the
cabbage
is
taken
from
its
stretcher
and
borne
to
the
topmost
peak
of
the
house
or
barn
whether
it
be
a
chimney
a
gable
or
a
dovecote
that
crowns
the
roof
the
burden
must
at
any
risk
be
carried
to
the
very
highest
point
of
the
building
the
infidel
accompanies
it
as
far
as
this
sets
it
down
securely
and
waters
it
with
a
great
pitcher
of
wine
while
a
salvo
of
pistolshots
and
demonstrations
of
joy
from
the
infidel
s
wife
proclaim
its
inauguration
without
delay
the
same
ceremony
is
repeated
all
over
again
another
cabbage
is
dug
from
the
garden
of
the
husband
and
is
carried
with
the
same
formalities
and
laid
upon
the
roof
which
his
wife
has
deserted
to
follow
him
these
trophies
remain
in
their
places
until
the
wind
and
the
rain
destroy
the
baskets
and
carry
away
the
cabbage
yet
their
lives
are
long
enough
to
give
some
chance
of
fulfilment
to
the
prophecies
which
the
old
men
and
women
make
with
bows
and
courtesies
beautiful
cabbage
they
say
live
and
flourish
that
our
young
bride
may
have
a
fine
baby
before
a
year
is
over
for
if
you
die
too
quickly
it
is
a
sign
of
barrenness
and
you
will
stick
up
there
like
an
ill
omen
the
day
is
already
far
gone
when
all
these
things
are
accomplished
all
that
remains
undone
is
to
take
home
the
godfathers
and
godmothers
of
the
newly
married
couple
when
the
socalled
parents
dwell
at
a
distance
they
are
accompanied
by
the
music
and
the
whole
wedding
procession
as
far
as
the
limits
of
the
parish
there
they
dance
anew
on
the
highroad
and
everybody
kisses
them
goodby
the
infidel
and
his
wife
are
then
washed
and
dressed
decently
if
the
fatigue
of
their
parts
has
not
already
driven
them
away
to
take
a
nap
everybody
was
still
dancing
and
singing
and
eating
in
the
town
hall
of
belair
at
midnight
on
this
third
day
of
the
wedding
when
germain
was
married
the
old
men
at
table
could
not
stir
and
for
good
reason
they
recovered
neither
their
legs
nor
their
wits
until
dawn
on
the
morrow
while
they
were
regaining
their
dwellings
silently
and
with
uncertain
steps
germain
proud
and
active
went
out
to
hitch
his
oxen
leaving
his
young
wife
to
slumber
until
daylight
the
lark
caroling
as
it
mounted
to
the
skies
seemed
to
him
the
voice
of
his
heart
returning
thanks
to
providence
the
hoarfrost
sparkling
on
the
leafless
bushes
seemed
to
him
the
whiteness
of
april
flowers
that
comes
before
the
budding
leaves
everything
in
nature
was
laughing
and
happy
for
him
little
pierre
had
laughed
and
jumped
so
much
the
evening
before
that
he
did
not
come
to
help
lead
his
oxen
but
germain
was
glad
to
be
alone
he
fell
on
his
knees
in
the
furrow
he
was
about
to
plow
afresh
and
said
his
morning
prayer
with
such
a
burst
of
feeling
that
two
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
still
moist
with
sweat
afar
off
he
heard
the
songs
of
the
boys
from
neighboring
villages
who
were
starting
on
their
return
home
singing
again
in
their
hoarse
voices
the
happy
tunes
of
the
night
before
the
end
